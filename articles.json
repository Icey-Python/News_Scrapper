{"title": "On a mission to keep girls in school, protect them from sex pests", "content": "While living at a border town often offers lucrative cross-border trade for many people, this is not the case for teenage girls in Busia County.  Snarl-up of long distance trucks is a common feature at the town that borders Uganda.\n\nThe situation worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic with truck drivers having to spend longer days at the border town due to pandemic related checks.\n\nConfronted with poverty, teenage girls and women in the region engage in sex in exchange for money; money the young girls need so much to purchase vital things like sanitary pads.\n\nMany have dropped out of school due to early pregnancies, early marriages, lack of guidance by a responsible adult and ill-health resulting from sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nA young Teso woman, Ms Abukayo Murunga is, however, out to change this story. The 26-year-old has been in rural Teso for the last five years, doing everything possible to bring other women into safe paths.\n\nAccess to education\n\n“I am familiar with the challenges girls and women here go through. Challenges that limit their access to education and opportunities for growth. For instance, girls miss school during their menstruation days because of their parents’ inability to provide them with menstrual hygiene management products,\" she says.\n\nMs Murunga adds: \"I have seen families languishing in abject poverty and as a result, send their girls to engage in sex (not as express as it may sound) with truck drivers, as a way of fending for themselves and families. I have visited schools where girls as young as ten years have been impregnated. It breaks my heart. It is here that l find my reason to create change in this community.\"\n\nWith every rising sun, Ms Murunga is out to scale up her efforts towards addressing these challenges. Her initial activities reached the girls through the Amot Network, a foundation she started eight months ago. Now she reaches them through the Border Hub – a youth and community development organisation in Busia.\n\nMs Murunga says she has visited schools where girls as young as ten years have been impregnated.\nPhoto credit: Photo | Courtesy\n\nShe provides information on sexual reproductive health and rights to enable girls (and women) make informed decisions about their sexuality and not fall victims of their own desperation.\n\n\"With other like-minded individuals and organisations in the region like (CCGD), we do structured mentorship programmes; tailored towards providing information around goal-setting, life skills such as negotiation skills, assertiveness which go a long way to enable the girls stand up for their rights,\" explains the Bachelor of Information Systems graduate.\n\nLast June, she adopted the T-boxes (Talking Boxes) approach where girls freely drop their concerns in boxes at a local church.\n\n\"I adopted the use of T-boxes after realising that many girls were not speaking out yet they were going through a lot in their homes. Since then, the responses have been overwhelming,\" Ms Murunga says.\n\nShe plans to partner with guidance and counselling teachers in local schools to introduce T-boxes once studies steadily resume, following Covid-19 interruptions.\n\nMs Murunga and like-minded individuals at the Border Hub run a Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) programme where they boldly speak to youths about sex, a taboo topic in Teso.\n\nTeso region\n\n\"I am keen on providing information that’s focused on growing and nurturing them. I spend most of my time interacting with girls and women; getting to know their challenges and, together, we develop sustainable solutions.\"\n\nMs Murunga observes that \"they have so far reached out to at least 200 girls within Teso region. The girls then act as ambassadors in their communities, hence strengthening our reach.\"\n\nHer outreach has seen close to 50 girls who dropped out of school, due to early pregnancies enrol back in class.\n\nMs Murunga, who is passionate about advocacy, research and policy reforms on SRHR, is the 'Kenya ni Mimi' (a signature programme by the Ministry of Youth and ICT) ambassador for Busia County.\n\nShe is an Emerging Leaders Foundation (EFL) Fellow and the pioneer for Young African Leaders Initiative (Yali) Busia - Chapter. She characterises her success in women and girls' issues in Teso to the knowledge and leadership skills she gathers from EFL and YALI.\n\nResource mobilisation\n\nHer background with EFL and YALI, she says, has put her on the map including sitting on the Busia County Youth Technical Working Group where she has been directly involved in highlighting gaps that hinder youth development.\n\nThanks to EFL and YALI, Ms Murunga is equipped with resource mobilisation skills that have helped her engage organisations to provide sanitary pads to needy girls, implement the Talking Boxes and hold regular talks with girls in schools and churches.\n\nMs Murunga recognises that female poverty and reproductive health is a problem everywhere, thus uses social media too, to move the \"powerful information\" far and wide.\n\n\"I primarily use social media platforms to amplify girls' and women’s issues,\" she tells The Voice.\n\nThe main challenge in Ms Murunga's mission, however, is lack of a stable source of funding and a society that considers the topic on sex a taboo, and a patriarchal mind-set that limits women in terms of land ownership, decision-making and leadership positions.\n\nFor the alumnus of Kisii University, women's issues are pressing challenges all over the world thus require urgent attention.\n\n“I want to be at the very forefront influencing the formulation, implementation and strengthening of policies around reintegration of girls who get pregnant prematurely. I want to advocate for the implementation of zero price on sanitary towels so that girls can easily access them and stay in school,\" says Ms Murunga.\n\nIn the words of Mahatma Ghandi, Ms Murunga believes that she is shaking the world in a gentle way.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nJosiah Odanga", "date": "Monday, February 08, 2021", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3283714/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/9c5d734829c291b050b095669459650d/pR/murunga.jpg", "image_description": "Ms Abukayo Murunga during a mentorship session with pupils of St Thomas Amagoro in Teso, Busia County in October 2020. \nPhoto credit: Photo | Courtesy", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2021-02-08T10:37:51Z"}

However, when we were in the process of leaving the shaft, our colleague Ouma, who was in the deepest point of the shaft, was suddenly covered by a heap of soil.”\n\nAjwala says that their frantic attempts to save Ouma were hampered by the thick mound of soil, that had covered him, and the lack of sufficient space to scoop away the soil.\n\nPeople responded swiftly\n\n“After a few minutes, we realised that we could not manage on our own, therefore we sent one of us to call for help from outside. The people responded swiftly and we managed to uncover half of Ouma’s body, the only stumbling block was two heavy boulders that were trapping his legs,” explained Odhiambo.\n\nRead: Relief as man trapped in caved mine rescued\n\nNo sooner had the other artisanal miners arrived and joined the rescue mission than the shaft caved in further with another heap of soil falling on the trapped miner.\n\n“He was now in the deepest part of the shaft. The place had become pitch dark and so we were relying on his responses to locate where he was. Unfortunately, he stopped responding,” narrates Mr Odhiambo.\n\nOdhiambo and the other miners eventually called off the mission after they realised that they could no longer trace their trapped colleague.\n\nLocals from Lumba Village gold mine gathered at the site of the collapsed shaft.

This is exposing members of the community to danger. And all these are happening because the two investors are not seeing eye to eye. We must hold them responsible.

Some have even been filled with water,” said Mr Vincent Mwango, a member of the community.\n\nRead: Three women die as gold mine collapses in West Pokot\n\nAnother local, Beatrice Auma, 65, accused political leaders from the region of failing to create jobs for the youth to give them alternative sources of income.\n\n“Young people from this region believe that gold mines are the only places where they can seek jobs. They live extravagant lives from the proceeds of mining forgetting the high risks they put themselves in. They need to be empowered,\" said Ms Auma.\n\nMercylene Akinyi, sister to the missing miner, says that she is the only surviving relative of Ouma, who sat his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams last year and was waiting to join a tertiary institution.\n\n“Our parents died when we were still young leaving my brother under my care.

{"title": "From the US to Lesotho, Covid-19 crushed women's hopes as global supply chains came tumbling down", "content": "In her last weeks working the freight shift at the local J.C. Penney store, Alexandra Orozco took out her phone and hit record. The 22-year-old shot a video of the giant black-and-red ’Everything Must go!” posters, and posted it on TikTok in October.\n\n“Slowly losing my job,” she wrote below, days before the store in Delano, California shut for good, one of 156 J.C. Penney stores across the United States to close since June of last year.\n\nSince being laid off, she has applied for a couple of roles – counselling kids, delivering flowers – but has yet to hear back. “It’s so sad,” she explains over the phone.\n\n“And it’s hard to find jobs here.”\n\nHalfway across the world, Matefo Litali experienced upheaval, too. A skilled sewer, the 53-year-old worked at Tzicc Clothing, apparel-maker for US-based giants J.C. Penney and Walmart, in Lesotho, a small mountainous country surrounded by South Africa. She was employed for two months before nationwide lock-down measures forced all garment factories to temporarily close in March. After two days back at work, Tzicc confirmed her last day was May 7, 2020.\n\n“I felt powerless,” she says.\n\n“The first thing that went through my mind was, ‘Why me?” Neither woman has met. Nor are they likely to; one lives in a remote agricultural town on the west coast of America, the other 10,000 miles away in Southern Africa.\n\nSupply chains\n\nNow, both of their lives – and livelihoods – are linked by a global pandemic that has crushed one of the world’s supply chains and with it, economies, too.\n\nCovid-19 lock-downs have obliterated a retail sector already struggling to survive before the coronavirus hit, which has in turn, contributed to the collapse of the global garment trade and wreaked havoc for millions of workers, the vast majority being women like Ms Orozco and Ms Litali.\n\nOver the past two decades Lesotho’s garment industry, where nine out of 10 workers are women, has boomed to become its largest employer, crafting clothes for Levis Strauss, Wrangler and Walmart.\n\nMs Matefo Litali, a Lesotho garment worker and staunch supporter of Lesotho Workers Party (LWP).  \nPhoto credit: Neo Ntsoma | The Fuller Project\n\nWhile Lesotho is a lesser-known garment powerhouse compared to China or Bangladesh, it is another example of an economy heavily reliant on US demand. Outside of the African continent, America is the largest recipient of Lesotho’s exports – accounting for almost half –according to the most recently available World Trade Organisation data from 2017.In the US, meanwhile, clothing retailers have been hit particularly hard. The country is one of the world’s top importers of clothing, accounting for nearly a quarter of global retail spend.\n\nWhile J.C. Penney hasn’t been profitable since 2010, the 118-year-old chain filed for bankruptcy in May last year. Six months later, it was bought out but its workforce was slashed by more than 10,000 during restructuring, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to The Fuller Project.\n\nUS retailers\n\nJ. Crew, Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers also filed for bankruptcy this year. “And when a big US retailer takes a tumble,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, “the effects are felt across the globe.”\n\nLast March, as US retailers cancelled or failed to pay for existing orders worth billions of dollars, the effects quickly rippled down the supply chain. At Tzicc Clothing, roughly one fifth of employees have lost their jobs since May last year, says Tšepang Makakole of Lesotho’s National Clothing and Textile Workers Union. \"For women, it’s a disaster...The industry is facing a total collapse.”\n\nMs Litali felt weak in the knees when she heard that she was suddenly unemployed. A widow for the last eight years, the seamstress single-handedly supports her youngest daughter, who is 20, and her four-year-old grandchild.\n\nDuring the lock-down, her employer delayed her final $94 (Sh10,000) pay check for three months until May. The Human Resources manager at Tzicc Clothing, Masefatsa Mofolo, confirmed the company laid off staff due to limited orders. For months, Ms Litali received no income or support, instead surviving off donated food from the local church until her final salary arrived.\n\nJ.C. Penney\n\n“I got so stressed; I thought I was going mad,” she says. “I would spend the whole day sleeping.”\n\nBack in California, Ms Orozco occasionally walks past the town’s J.C. Penney. The windows are free from sale signs, the gates locked.\n\n“I was close to the cleaning lady who worked there,” she says. “It broke my heart to know I probably won’t ever see her again.” A spokesperson for J.C. Penney declined to comment on the closures.\n\nAlthough Ms Orozco lives with her parents, she still has car and phone bills. When her store closed temporarily in mid-March in adherence with Covid-19 measures, she was out of work for three months and applied for unemployment.\n\nShe used the time to finesse her side-hustle: a make-up business, selling lashes, lip glosses and clothes via Instagram.\n\nShe earns roughly $200-300 (Sh21,000-33,000) per month in sales, nearly five times less than her salary at J.C. Penney.\n\nToday, both Ms Litali and Ms Orozco’s lives look uncertain. In August, Litali landed a job sewing jeans at another factory, but she fears her temporary contract won’t be renewed. By next year, Orozco hopes to have saved enough to open a brick-and-mortar store. “It’s stressful but… I know one day it will be worth it.”\n\nThis story was reported by The Fuller Project, a global non-profit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.

They're humans.' I said, 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals,'\" said Trump, president from 2017 to 2021.\n\nIn Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump described meeting the family of Ruby Garcia, a local 25-year-old murdered last month by a suspect in the country illegally, according to police. Garcia's sister denied the former president spoke with the family, according to local media reports.\n\nIn stump speeches, Trump frequently claims that immigrants crossing the border with Mexico illegally have escaped from prisons and asylums in their home countries and are fueling violent crime in the United States.\n\nWhile available data on criminals' immigration status is sparse, researchers say people living in the U.S. illegally do not commit violent crimes at a higher rate than native-born citizens.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden, Trump's rival in the November presidential election, accuses Trump of encouraging Republicans in Congress not to pass legislation this year that would have beefed up security at the southern border and introduced measures aimed at reducing illegal immigration.\n\n\"Donald Trump is engaging in extreme rhetoric that promotes division, hate and violence in our country,\" Michael Tyler, Biden campaign communications director, told reporters on Tuesday ahead of Trump's speeches.\n\nTrump titled his Michigan speech \"Biden's border bloodbath,\" and said he met family members of Garcia, who was allegedly murdered last month in her car by Brandon Ortiz-Vite, 25, whom she was dating.\n\n\"They said she had just this most contagious laughter, and when she walked into a room, she lit up that room, and I've heard that from so many people.

A Trump campaign representative declined to comment on the record.\n\nThe murders of Garcia and Riley have allowed Trump's campaign to play simultaneously to some voters' fears about violent crime and immigration.\n\nSome 38% of Republicans cited immigration as the country's top issue in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late February, as did about one in five independents.Trump frequently claims without evidence that migrants have caused a spike in violent crime in U.S. cities.

{"title": "How Donald Trump would crack down on US immigration in a second term", "content": "Washington,\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump, a Republican running in the November 5 election, has promised to crack down on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration if elected to a second four-year term in the White House.\n\nHere are some of the policies under consideration:\n\nBorder enforcement\n\nTrump has said he would restore his 2019 \"remain in Mexico\" programme, which forced non-Mexican asylum-seekers attempting to enter the United States at the southern border to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their cases.\n\nThe programme was terminated by President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another four-year term in the White House. Biden defeated Trump in 2020, pledging more humane and orderly immigration policies, but has struggled with record levels of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\nTrump also would reinstate the Covid-era Title 42 policy, which allowed US border authorities to quickly expel migrants back to Mexico without the chance to claim asylum, he told Time magazine in an interview.\n\nTrump would use record border crossings and trafficking of fentanyl and children as reasons for the emergency moves, Time reported, citing comments from advisers.\n\nTrump has said he will seek to detain all migrants caught crossing the border illegally or violating other immigration laws, ending what he calls \"catch and release.\"\n\nTrump focused on building a wall on the Mexico border during his first term and has pledged to close gaps in the border wall if reelected. His administration built 450 miles (725 km) of barriers across the 1,954-mile (3,145-km) border, but much of that replaced existing structures.\n\nTrump would introduce a border security and immigration bill as one of the first pieces of legislation, Time reported.\n\nMass deportations\n\nTrump has pledged to launch the largest deportation effort in US history, focusing on criminals but aiming to send millions back to their home countries.\n\nTrump told Time he did not rule out building new migrant detention camps but \"there wouldn't be that much of a need for them\" because migrants would be rapidly removed.\n\nTrump would rely on the National Guard, if needed, to arrest and deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally, he said. When questioned, he also said he would be willing to consider using federal troops if necessary, a step likely to be challenged in the courts.\n\nTrump has also vowed to take aggressive new steps to deport immigrants with criminal records and suspected gang members by using the little-known 1789 Alien Enemies Act.\n\nStephen Miller, the architect of Trump's first-term immigration agenda, said in a November interview with a right-wing podcast that National Guard troops from cooperative states could potentially be deployed to \"unfriendly\" states to assist with deportations, which could trigger legal battles.\n\nTravel bans\n\nTrump has said he would implement travel bans on people from certain countries or with certain ideologies, expanding on a policy upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.\n\nTrump previewed some parts of the world that could be subjected to a renewed travel ban in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and \"anywhere else that threatens our security.\"\n\nDuring the speech, Trump focused on the conflict in Gaza, saying he would bar the entry of immigrants who support the Islamist militant group Hamas and send deportation officers to pro-Hamas protests.\n\nTrump said last June he would seek to block communists, Marxists and socialists from entering the United States.\n\nLegal immigration\n\nTrump said last year that he would seek to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to immigrants living in the country illegally, an idea he flirted with as president. Such an action would run against the long-running interpretation of an amendment to the US Constitution and would likely trigger legal challenges.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump greatly reduced the number of refugees allowed into the US and has criticized Biden's decision to increase admissions. He would again suspend the resettlement program if reelected, the New York Times reported in November 2023.\n\nTrump has said he would push for a \"a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values.\" In his first term, he took steps to tighten access to some visa programs, including a suspension of many work visas during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTrump has vowed to end Biden \"parole\" programmes that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants with US sponsors to enter the US and obtain work permits, including Ukrainians and Afghans. He has called Biden's programs an \"outrageous abuse of parole authority.\"\n\nHe would seek to roll back Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations, the New York Times reported, targeting another humanitarian program that offers deportation relief and work permits to hundreds of thousands.\n\nTrump tried to phase out most TPS enrollment during his first term, but was slowed by legal challenges.

{"title": "Why Kenya has not abolished the death penalty", "content": "In recent months two African states have announced their intentions to abolish the death penalty – Zambia and the Central African Republic.\n\nIn all, 22 member countries of the African Union (AU) have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, and one for ordinary crimes. In 2021, only four countries in the AU carried out executions: Botswana, Egypt, Somalia and South Sudan.\n\n17 African countries are considered “de facto abolitionist” states, meaning that they have not carried out an execution in 10 years.\n\nThese include Kenya, which retains the death penalty by hanging – a British colonial relic. This sentence can be handed down for the crimes of murder, other offences resulting in death, robbery not resulting in death and treason. Kenya hasn’t carried out an execution since 1987, when Hezekiah Ochuka and Pancras Oteyo Okumu were executed for their role in the failed attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Moi in 1982.\n\nRead: Monica Kimani: Joseph 'Jowie' Irungu sentenced to death for Kilimani murder\n\nAfter 35 years of no executions, why hasn’t the law been abolished? Based on our research and legal expertise, we believe that Kenya retains the death penalty out of habit, convenience and simple inertia rather than any evidence-based consideration of its effectiveness or popularity.\n\nOur recent study found that Kenyans’ knowledge of the death penalty is relatively limited. Just 66% of the public are aware that the country retains the death penalty. Only 21% know that no executions have taken place in 35 years. Most years, more than 100 people are sentenced to death, mostly for murder or robbery with violence.\n\nAnother factor that may contribute to the government’s inertia is that the death row population is managed by regular mass commutations. Death sentences of 4,000 prisoners were commuted in 2009 under President Mwai Kibaki. And in 2016 another 2,747 under President Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\nUnderstanding the death penalty in Kenya\n\nUnderstanding the death penalty in Kenya\n\nBut executions could resume as long as the law remains on the books. It is therefore our expert view that it is important to press for abolition. This would provide psychological relief for those living in the shadow of death. Indeed, international jurisprudence suggests that that long periods on death row – referred to as “death row phenomenon” – constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.\n\nLatest research conducted by The Death Penalty Project, the University of Oxford and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights suggests that Kenyan opinion shapers are in favour of abolition, and public opinion is no impediment. So alongside legal or legislative reform, there should be civil society engagement and action from the community at a local level, bringing the public on the journey.\n\nThe Kenyan death penalty explained\n\nEfforts have been made to restrict the scope and application of capital punishment. In 2017, Kenya’s Supreme Court declared the mandatory death penalty for murder unconstitutional. This introduced judicial discretion as to whether the death sentence should be imposed. Execution was set as the maximum penalty, but not the only one.\n\nThe courts do still hand down death sentences. By the end of 2021 there were 601 people on death row and 14 death sentences had been passed that year.\n\nGovernments that continue to apply the death penalty commonly argue that their citizens are in favour of it. Kenya’s leaders are no exception. In 2007 and 2015 the Kenyan parliament voted against abolition of the death penalty (when bills were initiated by individual lawmakers, but rejected by parliament).\n\nRead: Number of those condemned to death falls as debate on capital punishment rages\n\nThe justification cited was public support for retention. Kenyan delegates told a UN committee in 2013 that abolition was “not supported by the will of the Kenyan people”.\n\nOur rigorous research suggests that this is not the case.\n\nPublic opinion is no barrier to abolition\n\nOur public opinion study surveyed a representative sample of 1,672 Kenyans. We found that a small majority (51%) supported retention of the death penalty. Just under a third were strongly in favour of retention.\n\nThis is a lower level of support than other African abolitionist de facto countries. In Zimbabwe, for example, our study found 61% of the public was in favour of retention.\n\nOur research also showed that in Kenya support for the death penalty in specific (realistic) scenario cases was lower than support in the abstract. For example, it dropped to 32% for robbery resulting in death and 27% for murder.\n\nWe also interviewed 42 opinion formers, including people who have jurisdiction over the criminal justice system or can be considered to influence public opinion, and found very high levels of support for abolition (90%), with the vast majority strongly in favour.\n\nThis represents the highest level of support for abolition across all studies of opinion formers conducted by The Death Penalty Project. In Kenya, opinion formers cited concerns about wrongful convictions as a reason for favouring abolition but also believed that the death penalty was an abuse of human rights.\n\nRoutes to abolition\n\nThe majority of those in the public who were initially in favour of retention stated they would accept abolition if it were to become Kenyan government policy. Likewise, almost all the opinion formers said they would actively support an act of parliament to abolish the death penalty.\n\nHistorically, there have been different routes to abolition in Africa. In Rwanda the death penalty was removed following the end of a repressive regime. In Sierra Leone, the president led a campaign which resulted in a vote in parliament. In South Africa, the country’s post-apartheid constitution paved the way for the court to outlaw the death penalty. It recognised the right not to be “subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.\n\nThe preferred strategy for Kenyan opinion formers was through an amendment of the criminal law. But it was also suggested that it would be necessary to apply several strategies simultaneously. The local approach would include actions from the courts, the churches and the president. Another path would involve lobbying Kenya to sign the international protocol on abolition of the death penalty.\n\nRead: Death row: Only 280 convicts have been hanged in Kenya\n\nRegardless of the route Kenya takes, our research suggests that opinion formers will actively encourage and even help facilitate abolition. And the public will not stand in the way of abolishing a punishment that has clearly died out in practice.\n\nReport by:\n\nCarolyn Hoyle, Director of the University of Oxford Death Penalty Research Unit, Centre for Criminology, Faculty of Law, University of Oxford\n\nLucy Harry, Post-Doctoral Researcher, Death Penalty Research Unit (DPRU), University of Oxford\n\nParvais Jabbar, Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director of the Death Penalty Project, University of Oxford\n\n", "author": "By \nThe Conversation", "date": "Thursday, March 14, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4555478/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/e58b415113c8fcdb39e7180100a3c4a4/aR/death-penaltypic.jpg", "image_description": "After 35 years of no executions, why hasn’t  Kenya abolished the death penalty?", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-03-14T05:41:58Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "After toiling on their farms and incurring huge financial costs to nurture their crops, wayward figures lurking in the dark pounce and steal their mature produce. They strike in the dead of the night, leaving the farmer stuck in servitude.\n\nIf the farmer survives crop thieves, the middlemen, commonly known as ‘brokers’, come for the little that is left. The end result is raw, endless pain.\n\n“That is the reason why I am asking the Central Region Security Committee to publish a timeframe and a plan on how to deal with crop thefts. It is no longer a laughing matter since farmers are losing more than 40 per cent of their produce to thieves,” said Murang’a Senator Joe Nyutu in an interview.\n\nA pickup truck ferries macadamia nuts along Murang'a - Sagana road on March 29, 2024.\nPhoto credit: JOSEPH KANYI | NATION\n\nHe adds that the issue is a potential security threat since farmers have started ganging up and lynching thieves.\n\nAt least 12 suspects have been lynched in the past three months.\n\nMr Nyutu says that the stolen produce is sold to brokers who offer a ready market. And the vicious cycle continues.\n\n“The brokers knowing too well that the thieves will sell their loot at throwaway prices will readily buy the stolen crop and make a killing,” he said.\n\nAvocados, macadamia nuts, sugarcane, cassava, sweet potatoes, arrowroots and vegetables are the major targets. In extreme cases, the thieves also milk dairy cows, harvest tea and coffee under the cover of darkness.\n\nMurang’a crop director Mr John Muchiri says the farmers’ situation is agonising, adding that despite having laws and by-laws to structure area markets, they have never been implemented.\n\nWorkers picking tea leaves at a fam in Gatanga, Muranga County. \nPhoto credit: File| Nation\n\n“Brokers use faulty weighing scales and even steal items that have to be counted. The elderly and the illiterate farmers suffer the most,” Central Region Fresh Farm Produce Association chairman Josephat Munyiri said.\n\nHe said that there is very little difference between most village brokers and thieves.\n\nFormer Mt Kenya MCAs Caucus chairman Charles Mwangi said the only way out is for governors to structure county markets.\n\n“We should do away with these mobile buyers who roam the villages to buy farm produce. We should have central points where farmers pool their produce and engage with buyers. That way, we will eradicate illegal markets that can be seen all over our villages,” he said.\n\nMr Mwangi county governments should liaise with the Agricultural Food Authority (AFA) to eradicate illegal markets and curb the theft of immature farm produce to sell to brokers.\n\nNakuru Woman Representative Liza Chelule said the government cannot spend a fortune to provide subsidies for farmers and then leave them at the mercy of thieves and brokers.\n\n“If we ensured that the cost of production is low, there is water for irrigation and there are no thieves and exploitative brokers. And if we ensured that farmers join groups, markets are structured and the playing field is even, then we will know that we are putting money in our farmers’ pockets,” said Ms Chelule.\n\nFarmer holds a macadamia nuts harvest. \nPhoto credit: File| Nation\n\nThe Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Kamau Murango said the future of the agricultural sector lies in the country’s ability to establish proper market infrastructure devoid of greed-driven elements such as brokers.\n\n“Farmers must join groups and have bulk market access points. Buyers must be known by name and their physical addresses. No crop harvests should be done outside specified cycles. Police at roadblocks should be helping farmers to arrest people who cannot account for the produce they are transporting,” said Mr Murango.\n\nMr Nyutu said a classic case of market distortion can be found in Murang’a where avocado processors pay millions of shillings as annual dividends.\n\n“But the truth of the matter is that brokers buy off avocados at low prices from farmers and deliver them to the processors. These brokers who deliver the produce to the processors or the exporters are the ones who are paid dividends, not the farmer,” he said.\n\nSo serious is the issue that Nominated Senator Veronicah Maina told President William Ruto at Kangari market on July 21 last year to help all stakeholders come together and streamline the value chain that unfairly gives the broker the upper hand.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nMwangi Muiruri", "date": "Wednesday, May 08, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4617040/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/c7978cba295fac8b0816f7c7ae2ea264/Fe/coffee.jpg", "image_description": "A farmer Evageline Wabeti drying Coffee Mbuni at Kabati in Muranga County.

{"title": "Jury orders Donald Trump to pay $83 million for sex assault defamation", "content": "New York, United States\n\nA jury in New York ordered former US president and 2024 candidate Donald Trump on Friday to pay $83.3 million to compensate the writer E. Jean Carroll whom he was found to have sexually assaulted and defamed.\n\nThe civil order, which prompted an audible gasp in the federal court, far exceeds the more than $10 million in damages for defamation that Carroll had sought.\n\nTrump lashed out almost immediately, calling the verdict \"ridiculous\" in a statement and promising to appeal.\n\nThe jury reached its decision after slightly less than three hours of deliberations.\n\nTrump had been in court earlier, storming out at one point but subsequently returning for closing arguments. He was not in court when the level of compensatory and punitive damages were read out by a court clerk.\n\nA juror exchanged a smile with Carroll as the nine men and women left the courtroom after the judge encouraged them to protect their privacy.\n\n\"It's clear to me... you paid attention,\" Judge Lewis Kaplan told the jury following the verdict.\n\nThe order was comprised of $65 million in punitive damages after the jury found Trump acted maliciously in his many public comments about Carroll, $7.3 million in compensatory damages, and $11 million for a reputational repair program.\n\n\"I was not surprised (by the award) partly because his egregious misbehaviour during the trial could actually have alienated the jury,\" said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.\n\n\"(Trump) is unlikely to prevail on appeal, because the (appeal) judges have great respect for Judge Kaplan, who is a very experienced federal jurist.\"\n\nTrump -- whom a jury found liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a separate federal civil case in New York -- used his Truth Social platform to fire off a spate of insulting messages attacking Carroll, the trial, and the judge, whom he called \"an extremely abusive individual.\"\n\n\"We were stripped of every defense -- every single defense -- before we walked in there,\" said Trump's lawyer Alina Habba outside the court. \"I am proud to stand with president Trump... We will immediately appeal.\"\n\nTrump, 77, briefly took the stand on Thursday to deny he instructed anyone to harm Carroll with his statements.\n\nDuring Trump's testimony, Kaplan limited him to three questions from his lawyers, to which he could only answer yes or no -- a precaution taken to prevent the Republican leader from returning to his custom of disparaging the court or Carroll in public.\n\n\"This is not America,\" Trump said as he left the courtroom following his short appearance.\n\nHe was not required to attend the trial or to testify. However, he has used the case, as well as others he faces, to generate heated media coverage and to fuel his claims of being victimized as he campaigns for a return to the White House in November's election.\n\nTrump separately faces multiple criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden, and a civil business fraud case.\n\nHabba sought to have the case thrown out Thursday on the grounds that threatening messages targeting Carroll, which have been aired in the case, began on social media before Trump's 2019 comments. Her request was denied.\n\nJurors were shown Trump's October 2022 deposition during which he confused a picture of Carroll for his former wife Marla Maples, which threatened to cast doubt on his claim Carroll was not his \"type.\"\n\nLast year, another federal jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and subsequently defaming her in 2022, when he called her a \"complete con job.\"\n\nTrump had been in court while he campaigned ahead of the New Hampshire primary, which he won handily over his only remaining challenger Nikki Haley, as he closes in on becoming the Republican candidate in the November election against Biden.\n\n", "author": "By \nAFP", "date": "Saturday, January 27, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4229302/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/44f513c116b2249f873e082b524c86e/nU/3.jpg", "image_description": "Writer E.

He has made the cost of living unbearable,” Mr Kioni said.\n\nHe added that participants at Limuru III unanimously launched a movement called Haki Coalition that will involve like-minded parties from Mt Kenya to address the affairs of the people of the region, “who have been neglected by the Kenya Kwanza government”.\n\nAccording to Mr Kioni, the coalition “will speak with one voice and work under the command of Mr Kenyatta”.\n\nLower taxes\n\nThe Jubilee secretary-general added that the people of Mt Kenya should meet again soon to deliberate on the issues discussed on Friday, saying such summits would be extended to other counties as the issues discussed at Limuru III affect a majority of Kenyans.\n\nMr Kenyatta was not at the conference though speaker after speaker claimed “convened his apologies”.\n\n“Haki Coalition will speak with one voice to address and champion the issues that affect the people of the Mountain. We will not work with individuals or organisations that seek to betray our calling. We will seek to have the One-Man, One-Vote, One-Shilling implemented,” Mr Kioni told the gathering.\n\nMr Muriithi, said governments in countries whose leaders have their citizens’ interests at heart usually lower taxes when the economy is not doing well.\n\nA youth holds up a placard calling for justice during the Limuru 3 meeting at Jumuia Conference Centre in Kiambu on  May 17, 2024. \nPhoto credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\n“The Finance Bill, 2024 is punitive. The government should not threaten its citizens,” the former governor, who is an accountant, said.\n\nMs Wamuchomba, who has been at loggerheads with the party she used to get the Githunguri parliamentary seat, said she has been intimidated and threatened with expulsion from President Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party.\n\n\n\nShe added that UDA leaders are not happy with her for siding with voters “oppressed by the government”, saying she would not capitulate.\n\nPoliticians not trusted\n\nMs Wamuchomba took a swipe at Deputy President Gachagua, accusing him of remaining silent when issues affecting the people of Mt Kenya are not addressed by the government he serves.\n\nThe lawmaker said a significant number of parastatal heads during the Kenyatta administration have been dismissed by the President “and the positions given to members of communities close to the Executive”.\n\n“Even with this happening, the Deputy President does not seem to care,” the Githunguri MP told the summit.\n\n“Let those issuing threats know that I am not afraid. I will continue speaking out on matters affecting Kenyans. The Deputy President cannot claim to be fighting for the rights of Mt Kenya residents when parastatal heads are being dismissed.”\n\nMr Waititu said Mt Kenya is preparing a database of individuals who will make ideal candidates in the 2027 presidential election.\n\nFrom left: NARC Kenya leader Martha Karua (centre),  former Laikipia governor Nderitu Mureithi and other Mt. Kenya leaders during the Limuru 3 meeting at Jumuia Conference Centre in Kiambu on May 17. \nPhoto credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group\n\nSaid the former Kiambu governor: “The region has great people like Equity Bank chief James Mwangi, Chief Justice Martha Koome, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, Prof Olive Mugenda and Catholic Archbishop Anthony Muheria.”\n\n“They are smart, clean, tried and tested, not hooligans. These people can contest and win the presidency”.\n\nCompletely forgotten\n\nMr Waititu, who was among the many Mt Kenya leaders who vigorously campaigned for UDA and President Ruto in Kiambu and many parts of the country in 2022, told the Limuru III conference that he regretted supporting the party “since it has completely forgotten me and the Kenyans who voted for it”.\n\nRead: Peter Kenneth: Why I will not attend Limuru III\n\nMs Elizabeth Wangechi, a resident of Nakuru County who attended the conference, told the Saturday Nation that she hopes the issues raised and discussed would be followed by the leaders.\n\nThe woman, however, added that she does not trust politicians and many other Mt Kenya leaders, “since they quickly change when situations demand”.\n\n“I am happy because I am one of the hundreds of people sponsored by our former ward representative to attend today’s meeting,” Ms Wangechi, with her two-year-old son on her back, said.\n\n“We did not pay anything but were in fact promised Sh1,000 each on getting back home. I only wish our leaders’ promises can be implemented when they get that power they keep talking about. Kenya Kwanza promised to improve our lives but look where Kenyans are now. There are very many taxes and everything has become expensive.”\n\nMr Paul Mwangi, a resident of Limuru, trekked to the meeting with a banner of local politician.\n\n“I cannot trust politicians when they make pledges. Those who have been loudest at this conference, claiming to speak on our behalf, can change any time when money is involved. Who in his or her right mind would have thought that Ruto as President would increase taxes and the prices of basic commodities?” Mr Mwangi asked rhetorically.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nSimon Ciuri", "date": "Saturday, May 18, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4626692/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/a7d2ca48a1973545622813ab5be9ec0b/rC/kioni.jpg", "image_description": "Former Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni (centre in black suit) joined by Kikuyu elders during the Limuru 3 meeting at Jumuia Conference Centre in Kiambu on May 17, 2024.  Photo credit: Wilfred Nyangaresi | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-18T05:37:25Z"}
{"title": "Biden, Trump agree on the dates of Presidential debate", "content": "US President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to face off in two debates on June 27 and September 10, setting up the highest stakes moments yet of the race for the White House.\n\n\"As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,\" Biden said on social media.\n\nTrump called Biden \"the worst debater\" he has ever faced.\n\n\"I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September,\" he posted on social media.\n\nCNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O, said the first debate would be held in their Atlanta studio with no audience, and would be moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Georgia is one of November's most closely contested states.\n\nThe candidates also accepted an invitation from ABC DIS.N, which will host a second debate on September 10.\n\nA separate vice presidential debate has been proposed for July, after the Republican National Convention.\n\nRead: Trump vows to fight 'anti-white feeling' in the United States. His allies have a plan\n\nKey differences between the two sides remained on the terms of engagement. Biden said he would participate in those two debates under strict rules to reduce interruptions, while Trump called for more than two - and a very large venue \"for excitement purposes.\"\n\nIndependent US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr claimed in a new post on X that he will meet the criteria to participate in the CNN debate before the June 20 deadline. It remained unclear if he will qualify.\n\nCNN requires its debate candidates to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold and receive at least 15 per cent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed only 13 per cent of Americans would vote for Kennedy.\n\nEarlier in the day Kennedy said Biden and Trump \" are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.\"\n\nDebates, which will draw a US live television audience in the tens of millions, are fraught with risks for both candidates, who face a tight race and low enthusiasm from voters.\n\nBiden aides think debates could hurt Trump by exposing his positions on issues, including abortion, that they regard as political vulnerabilities.\n\nTrump aides see Biden as prone to verbal slip-ups that could amplify voter concerns about the 81-year-old president's age. Trump will be 78 by the time the first debate is held.\n\nRead: Trump's fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen testifies at hush money trial\n\n\"Both candidates will be under greater scrutiny than they have ever been due to their age,\" Alan Schroeder, a professor emeritus at Northeastern University who wrote the book \"Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trial.\" He called the debate \"one of the only moments in which the candidates don't have complete control.\"\n\nThe first debate would take place after the June 15 conclusion of the Group of Seven summit in Italy and Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\nBiden's debate proposal, the first formal offer by his campaign, ditched the decades-old tradition of three fall debates and called for direct negotiations between the Trump and Biden campaigns over the rules.\n\nAsked about any preference for format or topics, Biden-Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said some details remained to be worked out.\n\nThe move to accept debates shows Biden is willing to take a calculated risk to boost his opinion poll numbers in a race in which he is trailing Trump in key battleground states. In addition to his age, voters remain concerned about Biden's handling of the economy.\n\nTrump, who refused to debate his rivals during the Republican nominating race, has in recent weeks been challenging Biden to a one-on-one matchup with him, arguing that debates should be held before early voting begins in some states.\n\nHe told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt the debate should be two hours and that both men should be required to stand.\n\nBiden's team earlier requested that only broadcast networks that hosted Republican primary debates in 2016 and Democratic primary debates in 2020 be eligible to host this year.\n\nOnly four networks hosted debates for both parties during those election cycles: CNN, Telemundo CMCSA.O, CBS News and ABC News.\n\nRead: Joe Biden jabs Donald Trump in election-year roast at correspondents' dinner\n\nThe Biden team showed no signs of accepting Trump's invitation for more debates. A Biden campaign spokesperson declined comment on the issue.\n\nBiden said he would not take part in the traditional televised showdowns organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, rejecting the nonpartisan organization that has managed them since 1988.\n\nTrump had also expressed interest in bypassing the commission, and the Republican National Committee announced in 2022 that the party would leave the commission's debate system altogether.\n\nIn a letter explaining the Biden campaign's decision, campaign chair Jennifer O'Malley Dillon cited the commission's past struggles to keep candidates from violating debate rules.\n\nShe notified the commission that Biden will not be participating in the three general-election debates sponsored by the group, which are scheduled for September 16, October 1 and October 9. The commission could not be reached for a comment.\n\n\"The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home — not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors, who consume valuable debate time with noisy spectacles of approval or jeering,\" Dillon said.\n\nBiden's campaign also pressed for a debate that would occur before early voting started and without the participation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or any other independent or third-party candidates.\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4624506/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/1f5b7378b01db4765b0502a4258f1a7d/fk/biden-trump.jpg", "image_description": "Former US President Donald Trump (left) and US President Joe Biden.\nPhoto credit: Reuters", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-16T05:45:28Z"}
{"title": "Man disowns biological father in bitter succession row for Sh500m estate", "content": "A man shocked an Eldoret Court on Monday after he disowned his biological father in a bitter succession court battle over control of more than Sh500 million estate that was left behind by the late prominent Uasin Gishu trader, Kireger Kutto.\n\nThe deceased had immensely invested in dairy and cereal farming, and left behind four widows and 27 children, the Land and Environment court in Eldoret heard.\n\nMzee Kutto owned hundreds of acres of land and prime plots in Burnt Forest, Ziwa, and Sergoit areas, Uasin Gishu County.\n\nJonah Rutto accused Philip Kutto, whom he refers to as his brother and not father, of sidelining him in the distribution of the late’s multi-million shillings estate.\n\nMr Kutto and his young brother Daniel Kiplagat had been granted letters of administration to run and manage the vast estate of the deceased who died interstate 19 years ago.\n\nMr Rutto jointly with Anne Chepkorir claimed in the court documents filed before Justice Reuben Nyakundi of Eldoret High Court that he is entitled to 80 acres of land that forms part of the deceased’s estate.\n\nHe claimed his father died intestate, leaving behind adopted and biological children, and that he is among the children the deceased took care of through his second wife Rebecca since childhood under Nandi customary law.\n\nRutto further stated that the second widow (Rebecca) was never blessed with children of her own as she was barren. The deceased had four wives namely Sarah, Rebecca, Mary, and Esther.\n\nHe claimed that his father died before effecting the transfer of the said portion of land to him.\n\n“We have been illegally and maliciously excluded as beneficiaries in the estate of the deceased by his adopted children,” argued Rutto.\n\nHe lashed out at administrators of the deceased’s estate for allegedly concealing material facts from the trial court to disinherit them, hence leading to a miscarriage of justice.\n\nMr Rutto reiterated that unless appropriate orders are issued in the best interest of justice, they risk losing their only share of livelihood and investment.\n\n'Not adopted'\n\nBut in a rejoinder, Mr Kutto said the appellant was never one of the children of the late Kireger Kutto, whether adopted or biological as alleged in the application he filed in court.\n\n“The two are not entitled to any portion of the deceased’s estate as they are neither children, beneficiaries nor dependents of the deceased. They have no rights to lay claim over the deceased estate, “said Mr Kutto.\n\nAccording to him, at no time did his son Jonah Kutto become an adopted child of the deceased as he alleges in his court documents.\n\nHe added:” I raised Jonah until when he attained the age of maturity/adult. As for the second objector, she is unknown to me as well as the entire family of the late Kireger Kutto,”.\n\nAs for the second widow Rebecca, Mr Kutto claimed that she was his stepmother who only had one child called Sarah Chemeli adding that at no time did he see her stay with an adopted child.\n\n“Upon the death of our stepmother Rebecca, the family sat down and we came up with her eulogy listing all her children including stepchildren, and nowhere were the two, Jonah and Chepkorir mentioned as children of the said widow as they allege.,\" Mr Kutto said.\n\nThe court will give further direction on the matter on May 21.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nTitus Ominde", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4004938/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/d608ea69f3920a2eacb24d8ccb7e0299/xV/law-of-succession.jpg", "image_description": "The merit and credit of the Law of Succession are derived from its capacity to ensure that people’s estates upon their demise get to the rightful deserving hands or custody.\nPhoto credit: Shutterstock", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-13T16:19:09Z"}
{"title": "Of social media 'likes', fake friends and the true reflections on life", "content": "This week, I have been thinking a lot about Ivan Illych, the central character in Leo Tolstoy’s novella, The Death of Ivan Illych.\n\nThis was partly because we spent two days at the work fellowship learning about relationships, and partly because, yet another friend quit social media after she went through a particularly bad experience that made her realise she didn’t have real friends on social media.\n\nRead: How would you cope with long-distance friendship?\n\nWell, let me tell you about Ivan Illych, before I continue with my reflections on relationships.\n\nTolstoy writes about a man whose life crashes just when he thinks it has started. Going by the standards of the 19th century when the book was first published, Ivan, a high ranking official in the Judiciary (maybe in Kenya’s standards he’d be the Director of Public Prosecutions) lives perfectly for The Gram.\n\nRead: Women and their fickle friendships\n\nHe hangs out with the right squad, at the right locations… Let's just say everything about his life is instagrammable. When we are introduced to Ivan, his death has just been announced.\n\nThose he devoted his life to, aka fake friends, are discussing the promotions his death will occasion for them. Let that sink in.\n\nRead: Sometimes you may have to end a close friendship that no longer serves you\n\nIvan Ilych valued the wrong things throughout his life. His problem is tied to his desire to look cool and fit in, basically ‘doing things for The Gram.’\n\nFor example, he married a wife he did not love and who clearly didn’t love him back because she belonged to the ‘right’ family and fits well with Ivan’s aspirations of class.\n\nRead: What it means when your friends outgrow you\n\nThis applies to his friendships as well. Instead of investing in genuine relationships, in friendships that truly matter, and caring for his family, he spent his life mingling with people of high society who did not care about him, but who only entertained him because his position suited their social strata.\n\nThe book is poignant and invites me to truly interrogate if I spend my time with people who truly matter.\n\nHumans are innately social beings, which means we were created to connect with others, in one shape or form. As we get older, we discover the kind of people we want to keep as friends, depending on values, interests and other such factors.\n\nRead: How would you describe your current friendships?\n\nBut there is also something bigger we discover: Not every relationship carries the same weight. Some people you encounter in life come to help us fulfil crucial life assignments while other connections are merely seasonal.\n\nThat is why we need wisdom to distinguish between general friendships and relationships that could be tied to our destinies. The speaker at the fellowship (the Head of Marketing) called such relationships “destiny relationships”.\n\nThey include relationships with our parents, siblings, mentors, children or spouses, and so on.\n\nRead: When it comes to friendships, the more varied the better\n\nThat session also made me think about the dangers of failing to pay attention to critical relationships in our lives – not calling that aunt who is always there for us, forgetting to text that friend who never misses our big milestones or not checking up on our siblings.\n\nOur generation is especially at risk of glossing over important relationships because of how increasingly possible it is to replace real life interactions with likes and double taps.\n\nI have a challenge for you: Do you know your tier 1 and tier 2 relationships? Using a house analogy: Who are the friends you only allow into your living room? And who are the friends you can allow not just into your living room but bedroom and kitchen as well?\n\nRead: Types of friends we all have or have had in life\n\nNurturing solid relationships needs genuine interest and honest effort. This doesn’t mean falling over yourself to duplicate everything your friend does for you. It means being present in your own way for your friends and family.\n\nDo not be that person who has time to reply to 500 comments on TikTok but you do not have even five minutes to return your friend’s missed call.\n\nIf you had an emergency, who is likely to come to your aid? A random person who commented twice on your reel, or your sister who is always cheering you on? I am not saying close down your social media accounts.\n\nRead: Why it is a friendless season for men\n\nHowever, do not lose yourself or the people who truly care about you while chasing after a crowd that will so willingly drop you for the next shiny thing that shows up.\n\nIn the same way you expect your friends and family to be loyal to you and to always have your back, use the same standard in the way that you interact and treat people.\n\nThe writer is the Research & Impact Editor, NMG ([email protected]).\n\n", "author": "By \nDaisy Okoti", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4622998/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/336b185f6577744de509d45690715054/AH/tiktok-1.jpg", "image_description": "Social networking service TikTok's logo. \nPhoto credit: Photo I Pool", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-15T04:00:00Z"}
{"title": "Rural healthcare under threat as nurses eye jobs abroad", "content": "Stakeholders in the public health sector have raised concerns that rural communities will be adversely affected by the increased migration of Kenyan nurses to foreign countries.\n\nThe massive migration of nurses abroad in search of greener pastures has got backing from the national government in recent months with many travelling to Europe, the US, and the Middle East.\n\nAccording to the Kilifi County Nurses and Midwives Alliance, the trend used to be common among doctors and nurses in urban areas, but of late, even those at health facilities in rural areas are moving out of the country.\n\n“After the nurses’ strike in 2017, many nurses were demoralised and we started to look at how we could survive and from that time, many experienced nurses started to migrate abroad in search of greener pastures...\"\n\nRead: Curb health staff crisis\n\n“Initially it used to be that doctors and nurses in Nairobi would move abroad, but as we speak now, many of our colleagues in the facilities are in the process of migrating, while many have already gone,” Kilifi County Reproductive Health Coordinator, Kenneth Miriti, said.\n\nDespite this migration, the health workers claim there has been little effort by the national and county governments to fill the void left in hospitals and health centres.\n\nInstead, they say, what they have been witnessing is a government encouraging more nurses to seek employment opportunities outside the country.\n\nTo them, an opportunity to work overseas is appealing because of the better working environment and salaries that they expect from foreign countries as compared to locally.\n\nHowever, this comes at a cost to communities, whose first, and most probably only point of accessing healthcare is at a clinic or dispensary mainly manned by nurses.\n\nRead: When the backbone of healthcare is disrupted\n\n“We have not been given the right opportunity in the healthcare system. The government has ignored the issue of salaries for nurses which is very crucial. You will find that a clinical officer working with a nurse in a dispensary earns a bigger salary,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Mr Miriti, veteran nurses have sensed the danger looming in the country’s healthcare system.\n\nKilifi County currently has about 760 nurses, with sources saying that a number of them are in the process of seeking employment outside the country.\n\nKilifi nurses and midwives celebrate outside the Kilifi County Referral Hospital during the marking of the National Nurses and Midwives Week on Monday, May 13, 2024. \nPhoto credit: Maureen Ongala|Nation\n\nThe Kilifi County Head of the Family Health Services Division, Ms Jesca Deche, says that the nurses' exodus has severely affected service delivery at the grassroots.​\n\n“We are facing a shortage of nurses in our county. Some retired, others died, others are on transfer while others moved abroad in search of greener pastures because of poor salaries for nurses in Kenya,” she said.\n\nMs Deche said the County Public Service Board has not employed nurses for over five years despite the gaps left.\n\n“A majority of the nurses who have been there within that period have gone abroad, severely affecting service delivery from dispensaries and forcing us to hire nurses on contract for the referral hospitals,” she said.\n\nRead: The pain of being a medic in Kenya: My hopeless battle with debt, low pay and suicidal thoughts\n\nShe expressed concerns over the quality of service by newly employed nurses, who she said had no one to mentor them, especially those in maternal health care.\n\nShe said the fact that nurses took charge of the health facilities during the doctor’s strike should be a wake-up call for stakeholders to take seriously the need to retain them in the country.\n\n“It is a serious problem and it’s a ticking time bomb if our county government does not intervene to address the gap,” she said.\n\nKenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) Kilifi County Chairperson, Ms Juliana Nyevu, said over 450 nurses were awaiting promotion by the County Service Public Board.\n\nRead: Encounters of Kenyan nurse who aced ‘tough’ test to work in the UK\n\nMs Nyevu said the nurses had presented their letters to the board.\n\nKilifi County Director for Health, Dr Hassan Leli, said the department was working to address nurses' grievances.\n\n\"At the end of it all you deserve rewards for what you give and as a department. We are working tirelessly to make sure all those who are due for promotion get them and also capacity building,\" he said.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nMaureen Ongala", "date": "Tuesday, May 14, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4622880/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/8a0c9eeb92386eeb45bc0ef85d0b859b/jm/nurses-2.jpg", "image_description": "Nurses from different counties during a procession at Kitale County Hospital on Friday during the climax event for International Nurses Week held in Trans Nzoia on May 10, 2024.\nPhoto credit: Evans Jaola| Nation", "category": "other", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-14T15:21:00Z"}
{"title": "Periods of despair: It's back to school but where are the free pads?", "content": "As pupils and students return to school for the second term, all eyes are on the government regarding the Sanitary Towels Program for girls in public primary and junior secondary schools.\n\nThe program, which came into effect in 2011, has been shrouded in confusion, with complaints that the government has not been supplying sanitary towels to schools as required.\n\nIts objective was to increase access for teenage girls to sexual and reproductive health products, thereby increasing their retention in school, transition to higher education, and enhancing their academic performance. It was also meant to minimise absenteeism.\n\nA spot check by nation.africa at several schools in Nairobi and Kiambu reveals that some institutions have not received sanitary towels for a while.\n\nA teacher from a public school in Eastleigh, Nairobi, who requested anonymity due to fear of victimisation, said the last time the institution received sanitary towels from the government was last year.\n\n\"As things stand, we could be staring at a crisis,\" the teacher told nation.africa.\n\n\"Many times, we are forced to give out our sanitary towels to pupils who unexpectedly get their periods. What else can you do when a girl comes running to you in need?\"\n\nThe teacher added that the sanitary towel program has been plagued by confusion and uncertainty due to inconsistent supply.\n\nStock of pads\n\n\"Things on the ground are different. Sometimes I look at these girls and pity them. Many can’t afford the sanitary towels, and the ones supplied by the government would really come in handy if their supply is consistent and assured,\" the teacher added.\n\nInquiries from two other schools in Kamukunji Sub-county revealed they are yet to receive the sanitary towels. However, things seem different at Kibubuti Primary School in Kiambaa, Kiambu County, where a source indicated they currently have a stock of pads received during the holidays.\n\nData from the Ministry of Education shows that a girl who misses school for four days in a 28-day month loses 13 learning days, equivalent to two weeks of learning per term. There are currently about 3.7 million girls in public primary schools, special primary, and secondary schools in the country who require sanitary towels.\n\nDespite the provision of Free Basic Education, many girls continue to miss out on education due to absenteeism related to reproductive health issues, as they are forced to stay away from school when they cannot manage their menstruation.\n\nStudies have shown that girls from poor families miss 20 per cent of school days in a year due to a lack of sanitary towels. In an academic year (nine months), a girl loses 39 learning days, equivalent to six weeks of learning time. A girl in primary school between Grades Six and Eight loses 18 learning weeks out of 108 weeks, while within the four years of high school, a girl can lose 156 learning days, equivalent to almost 24 weeks out of 144 weeks of learning.\n\nThe government has remained adamant that it is committed to ensuring the sanitary program continues. Last week, the State Department for Gender issued a statement indicating the government will soon have a national launch of the sanitary towels program.\n\nLeaders including Isiolo Woman Representative Mumina Bonaya and Kirinyaga Woman Representative Njeri Maina, among othershave also been questioning the government's delay in supplying sanitary towels to schools in their areas.\n\nThe sanitary program has been dogged by audit queries, with the Auditor General, Nancy Gathungu, raising concerns about the insufficient provision of sanitary towels in public schools.\n\nPer the guidelines, the Education Ministry should provide nine sanitary pad packs to each girl yearly, one pack monthly.

{"title": "Group praises Aukot’s bid to stop police mission in Haiti", "content": "The deployment of Kenyan police officers to the troubled Haiti continues to face stiff opposition in both countries.\n\nFrom the Transitional Presidential Council’s lack of clear communication; gang leaders warning Kenya against sending officers, activists and Kenyan lawyers moving to court to stop the deployment, the situation remains uncertain.\n\nThe first batch of officers was supposed to arrive in the Caribbean nation this week as part of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission after Parliament and the Cabinet approved the deployment of 1,000 police.\n\nIn January, High Court Judge Enock Chacha Mwita ruled that “any decision by any State organ or State officer to deploy police officers to Haiti… contravenes the Constitution and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid”.\n\nLawyer and Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot on Friday filed an application in court asking that the government to be held in contempt over plans to send 200 police to Haiti.\n\nRead: Haitian gangs have better weapons than national police, UN says\n\nA Haiti-based group known as Movement Unforgettable Dessalines Jean Jacques (MUDJJ) reached to Mr Aukot at the weekend and thanked him for his efforts to stop Kenyan police from being sent to their country.\n\nThe movement said that the move by the lawyer who has been on the forefront in opposing the deployment of the officers to Haiti and even filed a case in court to stop the process, was well-guided.\n\n“We deeply appreciate your principled stance against the deployment of Kenyan police forces to Haiti, a move that many, including ourselves, view as unconstitutional and misaligned with the interest of the Haitian people,” reads a letter the group wrote to Mr Aukot, and which is in our possession.\n\nIt further said the move by Mr Aukot resonates well with Haitians.\n\nExternal interference\n\nThe group said that the problems that the people of Haiti are facing can only be addressed internally, and the country does not need external interference.\n\nMUDJJ said the challenges in Haiti are caused by external forces, and this has been justified as a move to promote democracy.\n\nRead: Haitian business leaders 'extremely concerned' over delay to Kenya-led mission\n\n“These interventions, have, unfortunately, frequently served to undermine our nation’s autonomy and impede our progress. The current aspiration of the Haitian people is to see leadership that genuinely reflects their will,” the group said.\n\nThe movement further claimed that the actions of President William Ruto appear to align more with external influences than with the principle of African solidarity and self-determination.\n\nMUDJJ said that its main agenda is to ensure that peace is restored in Haiti and the people get the leaders of their choice.\n\nAlready, US army officers are in Haiti building barracks for the Kenyan police officers.\n\nThe immediate former Haiti acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who supported the deployment of Kenyan police, was forced to resign.\n\nMr Henry had just visited President Ruto in March to finalise the deal when violence rocked Haiti and gang leaders warned him not to return home.\n\nRead: Panic in Haiti's capital as wild shooting fills streets\n\nIn the first three months of 2024, over 2,500 people have lost their lives due to gang violence in Haiti. A top security officer, who is privy to the deployment plans, told the Nation that the first batch of Kenyan officers is expected in Haiti this week.\n\n200 officers\n\n“Everything is set and the first set of around 200 officers will leave the country soon,” he said without divulging more details.\n\nThe deployment will take place at a time when President Ruto is expected to start his State visit to the United States of America on May 23.\n\nThe officers who will be deployed are drawn from the Recce Squad, Rapid Deployment Force and Special Operation Group.\n\nSome of these officers will be tasked with securing some areas especially airports and other critical installations while others will be fighting with the gangs which have even overpowered police officers in Haiti.\n\nMost of these officers have been involved in fighting Al Shabaab militants especially in the vast North Eastern Region.\n\nThis means that the officers are well conversant with dealing with violent crime like what is being witnessed in Haiti. They have also been trained in the US ahead of the deployment.\n\nAnother headache which the officers are most likely to face is the gangs who have openly said that they will fight tooth and nail and wipe out any officers who will be deployed there.\n\nFor instance, Mr Jimmy Cherizier alias Barbecue has already said that if the Kenyan officers arrive there then it will not be business as usual but massacre.\n\nIn an interview with United States-based National Public Radio (NPR) on May 13, the notorious gangster warned the Kenyan police to expect fierce resistance once the multinational mission begins.\n\n\"If the Haitian revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines worried about his life, Haiti wouldn't be free today,\" he said.\n\nThis has also been echoed by Civil Rights Groups within Haiti that have also said that the gangs in the country would be too tough for the Kenyan officers.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nNyaboga Kiage", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4625768/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/91d1ce6b49c9fd3fb79e6d66a3e98eb5/zL/ekuru-aukot-1.jpg", "image_description": "Ekuru Aukot. \nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group", "category": "other", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-20T04:30:00Z"}

A similar request for facilitation including $13, 500 (Sh1.8m) temporary imprest for Mr Kenyatta and his entourage’s travel to Ghana in May for an African Leadership Forum was similarly ignored by the government.\n\nSunday Nation learnt that it’s on the backdrop of such ignored requests that Mr Kenyatta in January this year, flew to Kinshasa aboard a Uganda Airlines aircraft for the inauguration of Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi.\n\nIt emerged that Ugandan President Museveni’s intervention was instrumental to airlift Mr Kenyatta and his delegation.\n\nAlso Read: Influence of Mama Ngina in politics of the mountain\n\nThe plane carrying Uganda Vice President Jessica Alupo flew to Nairobi to pick up Mr Kenyatta.

The provision has been scrapped in projected estimates for 2024/2025 to 2026/2027 financial years.\n\nBut the government has reportedly asked Mr Kenyatta to take over the Nyari office that was assigned to the late President Kibaki but the former president has questioned why he is not allowed to select suitable premises as stipulated in the law.\n\nMr Kenyatta has questioned why he is being discriminated against yet other beneficiaries of the retirement perks including his predecessors, former vice presidents Kalonzo Musyoka and Moody Awori as well as former Prime Minister Raila Odinga picked offices of their choice.\n\nMr Kenyatta also cites his elaborate secretariat given his role as facilitator of the EAC-led DRC peace mission.\n\nAlso Read: You are our leader and we love you, DP Rigathi Gachagua tells Uhuru Kenyatta\n\nState House, according to the document, has also refused to procure official vehicles for the former president and ignored the office’s procurement plan for the 2023-2024 financial year.\n\nThe Act provides for two new cars of the retired president’s choice, replaceable every three years, each having an engine capacity not exceeding 3000cc as well as two four-wheel drive vehicles each having engine capacity of 3400cc.\n\nThe office had submitted requests for purchase of the four cars in February 24, 2023, but was advised to wait for the supplementary budget that had an allocation of Sh140 million.\n\nThe budget was approved, the procurement plan submitted for the purchase of two Mercedes Benz S 500, a Ranger Rover and Land Cruiser but to date there has been no action.\n\nAlso Read: Do not blame me for your failures, ex-president Uhuru Kenyatta tells off Ruto\n\nMr Mbugua also writes that State House “has refused to fuel all vehicles officially assigned to the office,” as well as “to repair/service vehicles assigned to this office.” By June, last year, there were 12 vehicles attached to the office, according to an inventory.\n\nOn staffing, the office protests postings without consultation and ignored requests for hiring professional staff.\n\nAccording to the Act, a retired president is entitled to a maximum of 36 staff including guards at all residences, drivers, gardeners, cooks, housekeepers.\n\n“The professional and other staff required to be provided for a retired president shall be public officers, but no person shall be appointed or posted to serve on such staff except with the concurrence of the retired president and such staff shall, in the performance of their duties, be responsible only to the retired president,” the Act states.\n\nAlso Read: William Ruto feeling the weight of his presidency\n\nThe office has 34 staff although some have still been awaiting contract renewals nearly two years later. Ms Kanze Dena, who served as President Kenyatta’s spokesperson and is now the designated secretary, communication, is among those whose contracts have never been renewed, and hence she has been without pay since September, 2022.\n\nMs Dena has reportedly complained her contract was due to expire in June, this year. Mr George Kariuki, who was designated as secretary, administration, also did not secure a contract renewal.\n\nAmong the senior officials in the office are Mr Mbugua, Constance Gakonyo (private secretary) and Winfred Gathuku (director, office administrative services) who are on contract.\n\nAlso Read: President William Ruto's second year journey and tough battles ahead\n\n“We cannot make our budget returns since State House is unwilling to avail to us budget absorption report for the financial year ending June 2023 for our reconciliation purposes,” Mr Mbugua writes.\n\n“The lack of support from State House, as evidenced above is despite the fact that Parliament did approve this office budget and the same is reflected for both 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 financial years,” adds the letter.\n\nOut of a budget of Sh655m in the 2022/2023 financial year, the office says only Sh28.5 million in payments for travel to Ethiopia and Burundi to attend the Heads of State and Government summit and domestic travel between November 2022 and June 2023 was received but there has been no support since.\n\nIn the 2023/2024 financial year, the office’s budget is Sh503 million but the approved estimates show Sh443 million. The funds have not been provided.\n\nMr Mbugua complains that State House has failed to respond to various correspondences from the office.\n\nState House Comptroller, Mr Metito, is the accounting officer and all correspondence from the office of the retired president is addressed to his office. Mr Metito and State House spokesperson Hussein Mohammed did not respond to Sunday Nation’s inquiries about these developments by the time of publishing this.\n\nLast year, the former president had the most publicised run-ins with the Kenya Kwanza administration yet during a dramatic raid on the Karen home of his son, Jomo.\n\nMr Kenyattat had to drive to the house on the night of July 22 to protest the action for the police in unmarked cars, who reportedly wanted to ransack the premises for illegal guns, to leave.\n\nOn live television, Mr Kenyatta dared President Ruto’s government to stop hounding his family and instead go after him personally.\n\nThis was the first time that the retired president was openly daring the government after months of sustained attacks from the ruling coalition’s politicians including accusations that he was sponsoring opposition anti-government protests.\n\nAt one point, a mob had invaded the Kenyatta family’s vast Northlands farm along the city’s eastern bypass, stolen many sheep and cut down trees. The attack came after senior figures in government had warned during the opposition protests that the former first family’s property was not sacred.\n\nThis had marked a dangerous escalation of an onslaught against the former president and his family that had initially started with claims that some of their enterprises had tax arrears. No evidence was provided to either show that the former president was behind opposition protests or of tax arrears owed by firms linked to the former first family.\n\nThe latest development surrounding operations of the office of the retired president highlights the deteriorating relationship between Mr Kenyatta and his successor, whom he had mistreated as his deputy and unsuccessfully campaigned against in the 2022 presidential elections.\n\nAs the Deputy President, Dr Ruto endured humiliation from the government that saw at one point his elite GSU security withdrawn from his official residence in Karen.\n\nAgainst all odds, Dr Ruto trounced opposition leader Raila Odinga, who was Mr Kenyatta’s preferred successor, to become the country’s fifth president.\n\n'Police raid home of ex-President Uhuru's son'\n\n'Police raid home of ex-President Uhuru's son'\n\nDuring the inauguration of President Ruto and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, which the outgoing president attended to hand over the instruments of power, the two leaders condemned weaponisation of the State during Mr Kenyatta’s tenure and promised a break from the past politics of retribution.\n\nEarlier in 2013, Mr Kenyatta and Dr Ruto had teamed up in an unlikely alliance that, despite International Criminal Court indictments, beat Mr Odinga to the presidency in 2013, and again in 2017, before President Kenyatta struck a deal with the opposition leader that estranged his deputy for much of the second term towards the 2022 elections.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nAlex Ndegwa", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4311436/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/45030af3b34bab38d20fb197633088be/Gt/uhuru-son.jpg", "image_description": "Former President Uhuru Kenyatta addressing the press from his son's home in Karen, Nairobi, on Friday July 21.

{"title": "Ending SGBV requires open talks about stereotypes, norms", "content": "Sexual violence is not a women’s problem, nor a girl’s problem. It is an entire society’s problem because it affects us all. Breaking down harmful stereotypes and bringing men and boys into the conversation are two of the most important norm changes we collectively need to nurture.\n\nSexual violence and harassment take place in our homes, public spaces, workplaces, on the streets and in our education institutions. Exposure is heightened in conflict and emergency contexts.\n\nDuring Covid-19, violence in the home has become what the global community call, the ‘shadow pandemic’. Reports from Kenya’s national helpline that responds to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) has seen a huge spike in calls since the pandemic began.\n\nEarly and forced marriage\n\nWomen and girls in Kenya often experience alternate but equally damaging forms of SGBV, both mentally and physically, including child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation and femicide. One in three women globally are affected by gender-based violence, and in Kenya, statistics record 45 per cent of women and girls aged 15-49 have experienced SGBV. One in five women have suffered from female genital mutilation (FGM) in Kenya and 23 per cent of the nation’s girls are married before their 18th birthday, while four per cent are married before their 15th birthday.\n\nThe exact numbers of rape and sexual assaults are difficult to assert due to reluctance or fear for victims to report it, and inefficiency in addressing the reports adequately because of lack of capacity and resources and sometimes will.\n\nWe are daily witnesses to ‘rape culture’, sometimes even silent bystanders. Society has entrenched the use of misogynistic language, the objectification of women’s bodies on screens, indifference to consent, and the glamorisation of violence in advertisements.\n\nVictim-blaming\n\nVictim-blaming, trivialising of rape and the stigma faced by survivors are still far too common. The understanding of mutual consent; that only yes means yes, given freely without manipulation or coercion – is paramount in the prevention and eradication of rape and sexual harassment.\n\nMale involvement in ending SGBV is particularly crucial as many Kenyan communities remain highly patriarchal. As authority figures, men hold more power and influence over decision-making in the social domain and are often considered the custodians of culture. They are in a position to determine the cultural traits, behaviours and social practices that are viewed as either good or harmful.\n\nThe socialisation of boys at an early age can have a long-term impact in shifting gender norms. Some harmful traditional notions of masculinity have been identified as the key drivers of aggression among the male gender.\n\nThese include expectations of what it is “to be a man,” where boys are expected to be physically strong, aggressive, showing little emotion in order to maintain the tough persona. What boys learn about expectations of femininity and the value of women and girls at home and in the community also shapes their attitudes towards SGBV.\n\nHealthy masculinity\n\nEfforts should aim at engaging men on the dangers of toxic masculinity and internalised gender bias that can be harmful to the well-being of women and girls. By teaching boys about healthy masculinity, as well as the links between gender inequality and violence against women, we can begin to promote positive behaviours and attitudes towards women’s rights, while eliminating harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nThe government has clear legislation and policies on preventing and responding to SGBV. The State Department for Gender is coordinating efforts from a multi-sectoral approach to advocate for this cause. President Uhuru Kenyatta has made firm commitments towards the eradication of GBV and harmful practices by 2030 and to eradicate the practice of FGM by 2022. This strong commitment and leadership is a source of inspiration for all actors, including cultural and religious leaders and calls for concerted efforts to stop the violation of human rights.\n\n16 Days of Activism to End Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign calling for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls. During the 16 days, from November 25 until December 10, we call on people from all walks of life to question those harmful stereotypes and norms that perpetuate violence. No further generations must struggle to cope with a legacy of violation.\n\nIf you or someone you know has experience some form violence – call the toll-free line 1195 or Childline 116 to report your case and seek support. You are not alone.\n\nProf Margaret Kobia is the CS Gender and Public Service, Dr Ademola Olajide is the Country Representative UNFPA and Anna Mutavati is the Country Director UN Women\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nAnna Mutavati\n, \nMargaret Kobia\n & \nAdemola Olajide", "date": "Thursday, December 10, 2020", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3224284/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/2c9be0481b746ad78ec71b0801f540fd/kB/op-ed-gender-cs-pic.jpg", "image_description": "Religious leaders and activists in Lamu march to protest against increased child defilement and gender-based violence cases in the region.\nPhoto credit: Kalume Kazungu| Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2020-12-10T06:07:15Z"}
{"title": "Like Scotland, Kenya can end period poverty", "content": "Menstruation is an uncomfortable, painful, inconvenient and expensive experience for many women and girls. It occurs once a month for approximately three to seven days; about three months a year.\n\nThose with no access to menstruation products are left to their own devices to manage their menstruation cycles, with many unable to participate meaningfully in daily life due to the difficulty of managing bleeding.\n\nMany girls resort to using unhygienic substitutes such as rags, newspapers, banana leaves, and even cow dung. Worse still, others turn to prostitution to get these essential products.\n\nUnfortunately, period poverty – the lack of access to menstrual products – increases the risk of toxic shock syndrome, cervical cancer and other dangerous infections according to research.\n\nWhile period poverty has always been the stark reality for some, Covid-19 has exacerbated menstruation-related challenges, especially for women and girls from urban slums and poor rural communities.\n\nMenstrual hygiene\n\nGlobally, women and girls’ rights activists are asking governments to integrate sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls in Covid-19 responses. In Kenya, at least 2.6 million girls currently require menstrual hygiene materials – pads, underwear and soap, according to Unesco.\n\nIn April last year, local women rights organisations petitioned the government to spend at least 30 per cent share of Covid-19 funds on gender responsive strategies including distributing cash relief, food and sanitary towels to vulnerable women and girls.\n\nThe pandemic aside, the menstrual hygiene situation in Kenya has been, and remains dire. Thousands of adolescent girls have to contend with hurdles as they go through formal schooling. In September last year, a school girl in Bomet committed suicide after her teacher humiliated her for staining her uniform during her menses.\n\nIt is sad this happened nine years after Kenya launched the Sanitary Towels Programme in 2011 – an initiative meant to provide pads to needy girls in public schools. It is the same year Kenya made sanitary towels tax-free.\n\nUnfortunately, some girls do not receive the free sanitary towels. The government in 2019, admitted a lack of funds to provide sanitary towels as required by law, with Education CS George Magoha saying the Sh470 million provided can only supply girls for four months.\n\nLack of access to sanitary products means many girls drop out of school while on their period, putting them at greater risk of child marriage and early pregnancy.\n\nIn 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Basic Education Amendment Act (2016) placing the responsibility of providing free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels on the government, to reduce the number of girls missing school.\n\nIn 2019, the government launched the Menstrual Hygiene Policy 2019-30 to among other things, ensure women and girls have access to safe and hygienic products.\n\nAll these measures were aimed at ending period poverty. However, that goal is yet to be met with Education CS last year admitting that the government scheme had not met its target, and many girls are still missing school during their menses.\n\nDisadvantaged girl\n\nThe United Nations estimates that as many as 20 million girls drop out of schools (globally) every year because they cannot deal with their menstrual flows. The Education ministry estimates that a girl absent from school for four days a month loses 13 learning days equivalent to two weeks per term.\n\nThis means that in an academic year, a disadvantaged girl loses up to 39 learning days, something that could be remedied by proper implementation of the sanitary towels program.\n\nAccess to sanitary products would also be of limited help if schools don’t have the supporting infrastructure, such as separate bathrooms for girls with doors and locks for privacy, a luxury in most of our rural public schools.\n\nMenstruation is a global issue and there is evidence of action to address its challenges. Last year, Scotland became the first country in the world to provide free period products for all women, while Germany reduced tax on sanitary towels from 19 per cent to seven per cent.\n\nCanada, Australia and India followed suit. France, Spain, Poland and Austria have also lowered tax on sanitary products. A handful of US States have also passed laws mandating free period products be provided in schools. The UK government too, rolled out free period products in all primary and secondary schools in England last year.\n\nKenya’s menstrual policies all look good on paper, but wouldn’t work in a real-world environment if not managed well. With proper management, we too, like Scotland, can make sanitary products free for all. Every woman is entitled to safe and hygienic menstrual facilities, and the right to manage menstruation without shame or stigma.\n\nIt is time to change the narrative, girls and women have suffered enough.\n\nDorcas Muga is the Gender Editor at NMG.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nDorcas Muga-Odumbe", "date": "Tuesday, February 09, 2021", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3284338/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/c96c917f4299d0cb618b52ba892bd1b5/HW/period-poverty-pic.jpg", "image_description": "Girls from Baringo County excited after receiving sanitary towels from a well wisher, Ms Diana Chebotibin,  in October,  2020.\nPhoto credit: Margaret Maina | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2021-02-09T05:48:03Z"}
{"title": "State urged to look into issues raised by intern teachers", "content": "As the nationwide work boycott staged by the 46,000 Junior Secondary School (JSS) intern teachers enters its second week today, unions have rallied behind the teachers while calling on the government to find an amicable way out of the stalemate.\n\nKenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) Secretary-General Collins Oyuu and his Kenya Union of Post Primary Education (Kuppet) counterpart Akelo Misori have warned that the strike risked paralysing learning in Grades Seven and Eight.\n\nWhile interns posted to regular primary schools earn Sh15,000, those in JSS are paid Sh20,000 , which they say is too little.\n\nA JSS teacher newly employed by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) is paid Sh34,955 a month alongside a commuter allowance of Sh5,000, a house allowance ranging between Sh16,000 and Sh8,133 depending on the work station, and a hardship allowance where applicable.\n\n“The employment of teachers as interns should have not taken place and we are in agreement with the High Court that [the arrangement] should be scrapped and the teachers hired on permanent and pensionable terms,” Mr Oyuu said in Nyeri County at the weekend.\n\nHe urged MPs and education stakeholders to address the issue and end the impasse for the benefit of both teachers and the learners.\n\nMr Malel Langat, the Knut first national vice-chairman, said TSC and the Ministry of Education should address the issues raised by the teachers and trade unions.\n\n“The intern teachers take home peanuts (Sh13,000 after deductions) while their workload is the same as that of their colleagues employed on permanent and pensionable terms,” Mr Langat said.\n\nThe Employment and Labour Relations Court has ordered that the terms for teachers serving on contracts remain in force till August 1, 2024. Justice Bryam Ongaya in an April 17, 2024 ruing said the TSC had violated the rights of the intern teachers to fair labour practices.\n\nHe said the TSC should employ teachers on terms that are not discriminatory and those serving on contracts should be confirmed on permanent and pensionable terms.\n\nThe first cohort of interns have had their contracts renewed for one year from February this year while the second lot is still serving their one year term.\n\n“Kuppet is ready to work with the National Treasury, the TSC, the National Assembly and the Ministry of Education to find a solution to the issue,” Mr Misori said.\n\nMr Ronald Tonui, the Kuppet assistant treasurer, Mr Henry Obwocha the secretary in charge of secondary schools and branch secretaries Mary Rotich (Kericho), Charles Ngeno (Narok), Paul Kimetto (Bomet) separately said the government should act on the matter and bring the strike to an end.\n\n“Parliament should set aside adequate funds to employ the intern teachers who are already engaged by the government, besides the others who are taken on board annually,” Mr Tonui said.\n\nMr Obwocha accused the TSC of lacking “goodwill to address the matter once and for all.”\n\n“We have had demonstrations at the county headquarters in the 47 counties in the past week, but we are changing tack this week by cascading it down to the sub-counties,” Mr Ngeno said in Narok on Sunday.\n\nTSC chairman Jamleck Muturi had in a statement issued on Tuesday last week called on the interns “to obey the court order and go back to school”.\n\nPresident William Ruto has stated that his administration has employed 56,000 teachers and another 20,000 are expected to be employed this year as the government seeks to bridge the teacher-student ratio in learning institutions.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nVitalis Kimutai", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4628408/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/e0bd8c4112dfe7a32dcc0e757f06461c/kn/new-content-item-1-.jpg", "image_description": "Junior Secondary School teachers hold a protest match along the streets of Kakamega town on Tuesday last week calling for interns to be employed on permanent and pensionable terms.\nPhoto credit: Isaac Wale | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-20T03:45:00Z"}

{"title": "The inside story of Elon Musk’s mass firings of Tesla Supercharger staff", "content": "The day before Elon Musk fired virtually all of Tesla’s electric-vehicle charging division last month, they had high hopes as charging chief Rebecca Tinucci went to meet with Musk about the network’s future, four former charging-network staffers told Reuters.\n\nAfter Tinucci had cut between 15 percent and percent of staffers two weeks earlier, part of much wider layoffs, they believed Musk would affirm plans for a massive charging-network expansion.\n\nThe meeting could not have gone worse. Musk, the employees said, was not pleased with Tinucci’s presentation and wanted more layoffs. When she balked, saying deeper cuts would undermine charging-business fundamentals, he responded by firing her and her entire 500-member team.\n\nThe departures have upended a network widely viewed as a signature Tesla achievement and a key driver of its EV sales. Tesla Superchargers account for more than 60 percent of US high-speed charging ports, federal statistics show, and the company has been the biggest winner so far of $5 billion in federal funding for new chargers.\n\nThis account, the most detailed to date on the Supercharger firings and the fallout, is based on interviews with eight former charging-division employees, one contractor and a Tesla email sent to outside vendors. Only Musk and Tinucci were in the meeting described to Reuters; the four sources with knowledge of the meeting are relaying what they heard about it from Supercharger department managers.\n\nTesla, Musk and Tinucci did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.\n\nMass firings\n\nDespite the mass firings, Musk has since posted on social media promising to continue expanding the network. But three former charging-team employees told Reuters they have been fielding calls from vendors, contractors and electric utilities, some of which had spent millions of dollars on equipment and infrastructure to help build out Tesla’s network.\n\nA letter sent earlier this month by a Tesla global-supply manager to Supercharger contractors and suppliers instructed them to “please hold on breaking ground on any newly awarded construction projects” and halt materials purchases, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters. “I understand that this period of change may be challenging, and that patience is not easy when expecting to be paid!”\n\nTesla electric vehicle chargers are seen during the winter in Hofn, Iceland, February 16, 2022.\nPhoto credit: Nacho Doce | Reuters\n\nTesla's energy team, which sells solar and battery-storage products for homes and businesses, was tasked with taking over Superchargers and calling some partners to close out ongoing charger-construction projects, said three of the former Tesla employees.\n\nOne construction contractor said Tesla staffers contacting his company since the layoffs “don’t know a thing.” The contractor said he had expected Supercharger projects to provide about 20% of his 2024 revenue but now plans to diversify to avoid relying on Tesla.\n\nTinucci was one of few high-ranking female Tesla executives. She recently started reporting directly to Musk, following the departure of battery-and-energy chief Drew Baglino, according to four former Supercharger-team staffers. They said Baglino had historically overseen the charging department without much involvement from Musk.\n\nThe charging-team layoffs mark the latest drama in a tumultuous year for Tesla as Musk has shut down or delayed several core efforts meant to drive the rapid EV sales growth that investors have expected. Instead, Musk now says Tesla will shift its main focus to self-driving cars, a fiercely competitive and riskier business that could take years to develop.\n\nThe company posted its first decline in auto sales since 2020 in the first quarter amid fierce competition from Chinese electric-vehicle makers and sagging worldwide EV demand. Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-awaited affordable car known as the Model 2. That has thrown into doubt Tesla’s plans for new factories in Mexico and India, where Musk had been expected to travel last month to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before canceling at the last minute. And a host of executives have departed amid deep companywide layoffs.\n\nScaled-back charging expansion\n\nThe energy team that was assigned to take over charging-network management has some similar design and construction roles, two of the former Tesla employees said. But charging projects are fundamentally different because they are located in public places and require extensive negotiations with utilities, local governments and landowners, they said.\n\nThe energy team was already struggling to keep pace with its current workload, said two of the former charging-network staffers. Yet when the layoffs came down on April 30, Musk posted that the company “still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace.” On Friday, Musk posted that “Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year.”\n\nTwo former Supercharger staffers called the $500 million expansion budget a significant reduction from what the team had planned for 2024 - but nonetheless a challenge requiring hundreds of employees. In an analysis provided to Reuters, San Francisco research firm EVAdoption estimated a $500 million investment this year would translate to Tesla building 77 percent fewer charging ports per month in the United States compared with the automaker’s pace through April.\n\n‘Holding the bag’\n\nTesla unveiled its first Supercharger stations throughout California in 2012, with Musk calling the network a “game changer” for EVs that would enable long-distance travel and convenience “equivalent to gasoline cars.”\n\nThe EV-charging business requires substantial upfront investment, and analysts have often viewed it as unprofitable. But Tesla’s network had been profitable before the layoffs, according to four former Tesla employees familiar with the division’s financial performance.\n\nThat owed to Tesla’s cost-control and extensive analysis to choose locations that could draw business throughout the day rather than only during peak-demand times, when electricity costs spike. One former Supercharger staffer said Tesla’s costs per-charging-port were typically at least 50% lower than those of competitors.\n\nAs recently as last month, Tesla said in a securities filing that it needed to expand charging to “ensure adequate availability” for customers, particularly after automakers including Ford F.N, General Motors GM.N, Toyota 7203.T and Hyundai 005380.KS announced they would start making their cars compatible with Tesla’s charging plugs, giving their vehicles Supercharger access.\n\nAnother former employee said that rollout is “completely jeopardized” because there will not be enough new charging sites coming online, and the company was only starting to implement upgrades to allow more compatibility with other manufacturers’ vehicles.\n\nThree of the former employees called the firings a major setback to US  charging expansion because of the relationships Tesla employees had built with suppliers and electric utilities. Tesla had grown into one of the larger customers for many major utilities around the country, and many had hired new staff and planned new infrastructure based on Tesla’s charging-network expansion plans, the former employees said.\n\nOther companies may be able to fill the gap, the former employees said, but the goodwill built over time with utilities and other contractors from Tesla’s large-scale charging investments will be difficult to replicate.\n\n“It’s just unfortunate that now they’re stuck holding the bag on all these different projects,” one of the former employees said. “It’s really sad to see all these relationships burned and people be really angry - rightfully so.\"\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4623704/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/9c4fc3feb15b010f0521b9285c47d560/qP/elon.jpg", "image_description": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, gestures as he attends the Viva Technology conference on innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, June 16, 2023. \nPhoto credit: Gonzalo Fuentes | Reuters", "category": "Business", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-15T11:35:55Z"}

Kizingo residents claim privacy violations over planned highrise\n\nThe developer claimed to have found new material that was not available to the court when it issued the initial verdict.\n\nPart of the new material was that it had obtained validations of the Mombasa County Government approvals and the Nema license in adherence to the court judgment delivered in February last year.\n\nIt also said it had discovered that the court relied on its raw report from the site visit and failed to take notice of deletions and skeletal submissions the developer had pointed out and highlighted to the court.\n\n“Having found that the petitioners failed to challenge the change of user, though fully aware from the advertisement, the court erroneously used these findings against us,\" the firm said.\n\nThe judge said he had considered issues raised by the private developer and noted that the firm had demonstrated sufficient reason to warrant a review of the judgment in question.\n\n“After conducting such an intensive and elaborate analysis to the framed issues, the court is satisfied that the private firm in its Notice of Motion has … established its claim for review of the judgment of this court,” said Justice Naikuni.\n\nThe judge set aside his earlier judgment and directed the private developer to fulfill the pre – conditions before embarking on the project.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nBrian Ocharo", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4623864/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/acdd68f3e7ed94fdb43f01751d846f94/PN/kizingo.jpg", "image_description": "The upmarket Kizingo suburb by the Indian Ocean in Mombasa City. The court has given a private developer the green light to erect a 16-storey apartment.\nPhoto credit: Jurgen Nambeka I Nation Media Group", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-16T04:34:37Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "Sporadic incidents of tension, mayhem and chaos involving unknown goons have been reported in Keroka town since the advent of devolution, the latest being on April 11.\n\nSo, what could be the reason behind such incidents in a town originally dominated by a single community – the Abagusii?\n\nHere is an explainer.\n\nThe tension comes from a boundary dispute that has now escalated to an Appeal Court in Kisumu.\n\nIn the dispute is the emotive issue of double-taxation of market traders concerning rents, rates, licenses and other statutory deductions.\n\nA three-judge bench composed of Justices Hannah Okwengu, Ali-Aroni and Joel Ngugi is currently reviewing the matter after the Kisii County Government appealed the decision of an Environment and Lands Court at Nyamira that had initially determined the matter.\n\nAlso Read: Fire sweeps through part of Keroka town as border dispute heats up\n\nAlso, the dispute could be linked to political supremacy battles between Kisii County Governor Simba Arati and his Nyamira counterpart Amos Nyaribo.\n\nArati is the National Deputy Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement party. He has maintained that Kisii and Nyamira are composed of one Abagusii community that is under the control of the Raila Odinga-led Orange party.\n\nOn the other hand, Governor Nyaribo is the party leader of the relatively new United Progressive Alliance party.\n\nThe party, Mr Nyaribo argues, is the home of the Omogusii after the dissolution of the Simeon Nyachae-led Ford People Party in 2016.\n\nUPA has a majority of MCAs in the Nyamira County Assembly.\n\nRigoma Ward MCA and journalist Nyambega Gisesa is the national chairman of the UPA.\n\nAlso Read: Keroka Town boundary dispute: Kisii governor Simba Arati plans to appeal decision even as Nyamira's Nyaribo agrees with court ruling\n\nIt was Mr Gisesa who, in May 2023, petitioned the National Lands Commission, the Independent Electoral And Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the Kisii County Government, and the Ministry of Lands over the unresolved boundary dispute in Keroka - leading to the Environment and Lands Court ruling.\n\nThe conflict has led to an alleged loss of a boda boda shed worth Sh700,000 at Ichuni junction, Sh2 million worth of a public toilet and van, stalls and stock belonging to small business traders.\n\nThe Nyamira County Government claims more than 90 per cent of the town, and Kisi County wants a share of parts of the centre, asserting that the trading centre has expanded from the small market centre that it was into its territory.\n\nAlso Read: Resident wants judge to recuse from Kisii-Nyamira boundary dispute case\n\nAccordingly, Kisii County is claiming ownership of more than 50 per cent of the town.\n\nOn the other hand, the Nyamira County Government, in January 2024, changed Keroka into a municipality due to what the county assembly found to be its steady growth over the years.\n\nThis was done as per the Urban Areas and Cities Act 2011, when it was established that Keroka had a population of 107,922 people, far beyond the 50,000 threshold.\n\nWhile signing the municipality approval documents, Nyaribo directed that the municipality have its headquarters at Rigoma.\n\nAlso Read: Senate in new push to end persistent border disputes\n\nKeroka Municipality is the second largest in the entire Gusii Nation (Kisii and Nyamira counties) - larger than even Nyamira town itself – which serves as the county headquarters.\n\nThe name Keroka emanated from the name of a shrub – emeroka - that surrounded the town.\n\nFormerly Keroka Market Centre, Keroka lies along the busy Kisii-Sotik-Nairobi Highway and on the border of present-day Kisii-Nyamira counties.\n\nThe market emerged as an agricultural town but has witnessed steady growth over the years, attracting non-native traders.\n\nNyamira District, present-day Nyamira County, was hived off from Kisii District and established under Section 6 of the Districts and Provinces Act.\n\nKeroka town was established as an Urban Council in 1979 courtesy of then-area Member of Parliament John Andrew Omanga.\n\nIt became a town council in 1997.\n\nAlso Read: Road that holds key to peace on Kakamega-Nandi border\n\nSome parties in the court dispute claim that the town council’s mayor during that time was from Ichuni ward, which is part of Kisii County, and jurisdiction was entirely with the former Kisii District, present-day Kisii County.\n\nKisii County argues that Ichuni Ward is demarcated by EBC as entirely falling within its territory.\n\nIEBC's allocation of Keroka Farmers Union and Keroka Bus Park polling stations is the reason behind this argument.\n\nThe votes, they say, have all along been tallied for various administrative seats in Kisii County and that even the 2019 Census was conducted and tallied as part of Kisii County population.\n\nAt the advent of devolution when the conflicts started, former governors James Ongwae of Kisii and John Nyagarama (late) of Nyamira met with other leaders on May 21, 2012, and a resolution that there was no boundary dispute as conventional boundaries at the town were well known.\n\nA joint working committee in Keroka town was to report to Mr Nyagarama to create one centre of power. Mr Nyagarama, in turn, was to share reports with Mr Ongwae.\n\nRead: Machogu wades into Keroka boundary dispute\n\nThe duo was to appoint a town administrator and a deputy administrator who would oversee the service delivery in the town, such as garbage collection, provision of water, and firefighting, among others.\n\nOn May 21, 2014, various leaders from the two counties met at Nairobi Club and formed a committee on the administration and management of Keroka town.\n\nAccordingly, issues of Keroka were to be managed jointly by the two counties as a way to ensure a lasting solution.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nRuth Mbula", "date": "Friday, April 12, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/1190346/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/d429e9cbf1e2c31cf96ae5f72dc704a4/RG/keroka-pic.jpg", "image_description": "Keroka Town, which is at the border of Kisii and Nyamira counties and has been at the centre of a dispute over tax zones.

{"title": "Remember elderly women in campaign to end GBV", "content": "Maria is an 84-year-old widow from Riruta Satellite, a low-income suburb in Nairobi. She is a mother of five children, two sons and three daughters. Her husband died three years ago, leaving her with the family property that included unoccupied land and some rentals.\n\nShortly afterwards, she shared the property among her children as part of their inheritance and retained a portion as a source of income. Her youngest son was, however, unhappy with the division of property and maintains that his sisters have no rights to the property.\n\nHe became hostile and violent towards his mother, intending to directly collect the rent from the rentals. He has now threatened to kill his mother and sisters to take over ownership of the property.\n\nViolence and ageism\n\nUnfortunately, Maria’s story is just one of many. Violence against older women is widespread, with perpetrators ranging from intimate partners, family members, caregivers, and community members.\n\nAs we draw to the end of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, an annual international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls, we must reflect on and galvanize action around the need to better protect older women like Maria from all forms of violence and ageism (the targeting of older persons on the basis of their age).\n\nBefore the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that one in six older people- those above the age of 60 - globally, were subjected to abuse in 2019. This was spurred by factors including alcoholism and property ownership disputes, among other issues.\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that the abuse has sharply increased in many countries as a direct result of the pandemic.\n\nCovid-19\n\nConsider the containment measures instituted by governments to flatten the Covid-19 curve; the need for social distancing that culminated in the partial cessation of movement and in some instances, full lockdowns, have left, and continue to leave older persons alone, separated from caring kin who would otherwise often check in on them and ensure their wellbeing.\n\nThis exposes them to rogue community members, relatives and caregivers who use the opportunity to exercise their control and abuse, particularly against older women.\n\nA report by the Social Science Research Council indicates that Kenya is among the countries reporting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent average increase in sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) amid lockdowns. This harrowing statistic encompasses SGBV against older persons. What is worse is that victims rarely report the abuse for fear of victimisation. A vicious cycle is, therefore, established, fuelled by ageism and sustained by the inaction of the government and communities.\n\nHelpAge International Africa continues to work with communities to support them to recognize and prevent SGBV against older women and help them access safety and response services. This includes access to counselling and legal advice for survivors. We also provide older people with the information they need to seek support in case of abuse.\n\nViolence and abuse\n\nAdditionally, we continue to advocate for laws and policies to protect older women from violence, abuse, and neglect. One such law is the Protocol to the African Charter On Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa. This law provides for, among others, the right to property inheritance by older women; their protection from all forms of violence and abuse, including those emanating from harmful traditional practices; and the provision of care and support. Four years since the adoption of the Protocol, Kenya is yet to ratify it, leaving the rights of older persons in the balance.\n\nEnding SGBV against older women will take a concerted effort. The government should ratify and implement the African Union Protocol on the Rights of Older Persons. Additionally, it must fully implement existing legislation that protects the rights of older women, including increasing budgetary allocation towards the protection and promotion of their rights.\n\nCommunities must also treat older women with care and respect. Ageing is not an event but a process that starts at birth. It is, therefore, imperative that we collaborate in putting an end to the mistreatment of older persons including SGBV against them.\n\nThe writer is the Africa Regional Director, HelpAge International.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nCarole Ageng’o", "date": "Wednesday, December 09, 2020", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3223488/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/24ac29ddf73429e4704cbd06c59e9c21/zQ/old-age-pic.jpg", "image_description": "Elderly women displaced by floods in Homa Bay County wait for relief food distributed by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa in 2018.Communities must treat older women with care and respect.\nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2020-12-09T11:22:58Z"}

Money, however is not always an indication of success; Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though she raised far more cash than he did.\n\nBiden has been routinely outraising former President Trump, whose campaign, together with a joint fundraising committee, pulled in $20.3 million in February compared with the more than $53 million raised by Biden's reelection effort that month.\n\nLarge contributions make up about 55% of the $128.7 million that Biden's campaign committee has raised so far in the election cycle, OpenSecrets data showed, compared with 45% from small contributions.\n\nFor Trump, large contributions comprise 64% of the $96.1 million his campaign committee has raised, versus 36% from small contributions.\n\nThe two face a Nov. 5 general election rematch, in a race that opinion polls suggest will be extremely close.\n\nBiden was holding a star-studded fundraiser in New York on Thursday night with his Democratic predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton that his campaign said has already raised $25 million.\n\nThe Trump campaign is due to hold a fundraiser on April 6 hosted by billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson in south Florida that aims to bring in $33 million, according to a person familiar with the event.\n\nThe Trump advisers on Thursday said that together with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will be opening dozens of offices and hiring hundreds of staff in the next few weeks, as they ramp up their general election infrastructure now that Trump has become the Republican Party's presidential candidate.\n\nTrump cemented his grip over the RNC in March when a loyalist, his daughter-in-law, and a senior campaign adviser were installed as chair, co-chair and chief of staff of the organization following his endorsement. An aggressive overhaul ensued, with dozens of employees losing their jobs.\n\nAs part of the leadership restructuring, a new slate of deputies will focus on battleground states as well as relationships with state parties and grassroots organizations, the second Trump campaign adviser said.

He scored victories in the early nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and is pushing to replace Republican National Committee leadership with his own top allies ahead of the party's July nominating convention.\n\nTrump, 77, has called the indictments a political witch hunt to thwart his pursuit of a second four-year term, an assertion that the Justice Department has denied. Several legal challenges have reached the US Supreme Court regarding his eligibility for the ballot following the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol and whether he can claim presidential immunity. If elected again, Trump has vowed revenge against his perceived enemies and has adopted increasingly authoritarian language, including saying he would not be a dictator except \"on day one.\"\n\nHe has promised other sweeping changes, including gutting the federal civil service to install loyalists and imposing tougher immigration policies such as mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship.

But Trump has increasingly targeted her, lobbing racist attacks at her ethnicity and amplifying false claims about her eligibility for the White House despite her birth in South Carolina.\n\nHaley, who drew 19% support among Republicans in the Reuters/Ipsos survey, has sharpened her attacks on Trump following New Hampshire's Jan. 23 contest and raised $1 million after Trump threatened her donors. She has also pitched herself as a stalwart defender of American interests abroad, citing Trump's praise of dictators, and ramped up her argument that Trump is too chaotic and divisive to be effective.\n\nShe has suggested she will stay in the race past the Feb. 24 primary in her home state, where opinion polls show she trails Trump, and her campaign has blasted Trump's proposed RNC changes, saying the political party should be overhauled and its finances audited.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks at a black-tie dinner for US governors attending the National Governors Association winter meeting, at the White House in Washington on February 24, 2024. \nPhoto credit: Amanda Andrade-Rhoades\n\nBiden, 81, already the oldest U.S. president ever, will have to convince voters he has the stamina for another four years in office, amid poor approval ratings and a special counsel report suggesting he suffered memory lapses. Biden has blasted the report, and his allies say he believes he is the only Democratic candidate who can defeat Trump and protect democracy. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll put Biden at 34%, while Trump garnered 37% — close to the 2.9 percentage-point margin of error.\n\nIn announcing his candidacy, Biden declared he needed to defend American liberties and pointed to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters. Vice President Kamala Harris is again his running mate.\n\nThe economy will also factor in his reelection campaign. While the US escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation hit 40-year highs in 2022 and the cost of essentials is weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost US  industrial output, but he has received little recognition from voters for the latter.\n\nBiden has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to sanction Russia and support Kyiv, and he has been supportive of Israel in its conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian aid. However, he has faced sharp criticism from some fellow Democrats for not backing a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, where Gaza health officials say more than 28,400 people have been killed, thousands of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and residents have insufficient food, water and medical supplies.\n\nBiden's handling of immigration policy has also been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border hit record highs during his administration.\n\nIn the Democratic Party's presidential nominating contests, Biden has easily won in New Hampshire,South Carolina and Nevada.\n\nDEAN PHILLIPS\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate US Representative Dean Phillips speaks at South Carolina’s First in the Nation Dinner at the State Fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina, US on January 27, 2024. \nPhoto credit: Tom Brenner | Reuters\n\nDean Phillips, a little-known US congressman from Minnesota, announced in October he would mount a long-shot challenge to Biden because he does not believe the president can win another term.\n\nThe 55-year-old millionaire businessman and gelato company co-founder announced his bid in a one-minute video posted online, saying: \"We've got some challenges. ... We're going to repair this economy, and we are going to repair America.\"\n\nPhillips failed to win any delegates in South Carolina and took second place in New Hampshire. He did not appear on the Nevada ballot.\n\nINDEPENDENTS\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR\n\nNew Content Item (1)\nPhoto credit: Rebecca Noble | Reuters\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination, but he is far behind in polling.\n\nSome recent Reuters/Ipsos polls showed Kennedy could harm Biden more than Trump in the presidential election, where third-party candidates have affected the outcome of US elections even without winning. Trump's six-percentage point lead over Biden in Reuters/Ipsos polling held even when respondents had the option of voting for third-party candidates, including Kennedy, whose support stood at 8%.\n\nKennedy is the son of USSenator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid. A surprise Super Bowl ad heavily featuring his connection to his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, angered his family members and prompted him to apologize.\n\nHe was banned from Instagram for spreading misinformation about vaccines and the Covid-19 pandemic but was later reinstated. He also lost a legal bid to force YouTube owner Google to reinstate videos of him questioning the safety of Covid vaccines.\n\nCORNEL WEST\n\nThe political activist, philosopher Cornel West.\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic said in June he would launch a third-party bid for president that is likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate, but in October he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJILL STEIN\n\nJill Stein, a physician, re-upped her 2016 Green Party bid on November 9, accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don’t even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Monday, February 26, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4537710/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/20e236fe86dc390f56809901e26de11b/Ys/us-candidates.jpg", "image_description": "From left: US President Joe Biden (Democratic Party) and other presidential candidates Nikki Haley (Republican), Robert F.

This exercise is also important because we want to send a message out there to those who are still dealing with the illegal business,\" said Mr Wanyanga.\n\nSamburu Central Assistant County Commissioner, John Mutiso, said the government is doing everything possible to curb illegal sandalwood trade through the use of a multi-agency security team.\n\nThis team includes the National Police Service (NPS), Kenya Forest Service (KFS), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).\n\n\"We will intensify campaigns and patrols to curb this illegal harvesting of sandalwood.

However, the government insists they have established \"a very strong joint security team\", and that no piece of sandalwood will be ferried past Samburu county borders.\n\nAlmost every part of the tree—leaves, stem, roots, and even bark—has economic value, turning traders into millionaires in Samburu.\n\nSome leaders in the region have accused local security authorities of failing to end the illegal sandalwood trade, which is enriching unscrupulous businessmen.

{"title": "How much is reasonable bride price? Lessons from Tana River man’s Sh7", "content": "When Hussein Charo from Tana River County asked for only Sh7 as bride price in December last year, he did not only baffle his guests, he also scaled national news because the action defied popular practice of turning such occasions into income-generating activities.\n\nThis was the second time Charo acted “strangely”. When his first daughter got married, he asked only for prayer beads, saying he was more interested in his son-in-law’s integrity than wealth.\n\nThis behaviour raises questions about bride price. Why do we consider it mandatory? How does it affect the status of women relative to men in marriage? What is women’s say about it? How much is reasonable and how much is not? Who is the primary beneficiary?\n\nProspective children\n\nThe consideration takes the form of livestock, money, foodstuff, utensils, other material items and even labour, depending on the community. Two scholars, John S. Mbiti and Isaac Osabutey-Aguedze, aver that bride price was traditionally to cement inter-familial relationships, express gratitude for the girl’s upbringing, ‘compensate’ for the transferred labour, demonstrate the man’s willingness to enter into a marriage and signal his ability to take care of the wife and prospective children. The gifts were reminders of the maiden’s physical absence and signified her value to the maiden and marital families.\n\nNo one should begrudge individuals from continuing with the practice as the Constitution of Kenya embeds the right to one’s culture. The Marriage Act (2014) also recognises the practice but requires it to be only a token to formalise customary unions.\n\nFrom a gender perspective, bride-price is a patriarchal relic that subjugates women. In the first instance, the negotiations are male affairs even though the subject matter is a woman.\n\nIn fact, the bride does not even share in the payment or have a say on how it is used. In the second, men paying it (some under duress) wait to recover their pound of flesh through dominance over their wives citing the power assigned to them by the bride price. This is evident in cases where men count their wives as part of their property.\n\nDysfunctional unions\n\nIn some communities, women are subjected to insults insinuating that their level of intelligence is equal to that of the animals paid for them! Also, the understanding that the bride price is recovered should the marriage break down puts pressure on women to tolerate dysfunctional unions to protect the parents from the imminent loss.\n\nBride price has today become so steep, it is basically a captive wealth generating activity for the bride’s family, technically the paternal side, and a burdensome tax on men. In many cases, the price is based on the bride’s level of formal education and career. The higher the two, the more the expectation, as evident in the October 2019 case in Meru where a man demanded Sh1 million, to the chagrin of the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders, which in turn vowed to draft a law standardising the payment in their area of jurisdiction.\n\nAn anecdote from one nuptial experience has it that a medical doctor went to pay bride price for his partner, also a doctor. But the father-in-law made it clear that the amount paid was not commensurate with his daughter’s status. The groom apologised but gave his father-in-law a piece of poetic justice. He asked him to replace her with one equivalent to his means!\n\nNuptial ceremonies\n\nSimply put, placing a price on a bride commercialises marriage, objectifies women and transforms them into wares for sale, in the same way as done in ancient Russia where they were called Kunka, derived from Kuna (marten), the currency of payment.\n\nA cursory look reveals that nuptial ceremonies today are more of exhibitions of financial, material and vehicular grandeur than anything else. This is evident in comments equating success with the number of guests and expensive cars in attendance. This not only puts pressure on men, it also diverts attention from the primary purpose of marriage.\n\nFrom the deep entrenchment of the practice, any suggestion to outlaw it would be opposed by both men and women, the former because this would disrobe them of power and the latter because it is probably the only expression of appreciation they and their parents are assured of.\n\nGender equality\n\nMr Charo’s action, comical as it looks, is a reminder that we should re-examine bride price in light of gender equality. Standardising the payment might appear like interference with personal choice.\n\nHowever, it will return some sanity and redeem the practice from the financially draining monster it has become. It is also time we replaced the term ‘bride price’ with ‘gifts’ to remove the commercial connotation. The Njuri Ncheke also owes us an update on the draft law.\n\nThe writer is an international gender and development consultant and scholar.

{"title": "Sheryl Sandberg’s battle against imposter syndrome", "content": "Regardless of being the embodiment of confidence, there are days Sheryl Kara Sandberg still feels like a fraud.\n\nIn August 2011, Forbes magazine released its annual list of World’s 100 Most Powerful Women. Instead of feeling elated, Sheryl was horrified to learn that Forbes ranked her as the fifth most powerful woman in the world.\n\nShe was positioned after German chancellor Angela Merkel, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. This placed her ahead of First Lady Michelle Obama and Indian politician Sonia Gandhi.\n\nRead: Imposter syndrome is common, but has a cure\n\nWhen colleagues congratulated her in the hallway of Facebook headquarters, in Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto, California, she cringed in embarrassment and declared the list ridiculous.\n\nFriends posted the Forbes list link on Facebook and she asked them to disassemble it. After a few days, Sheryl's veteran executive assistant, Camille Hart, chastised her absurdity of subjecting everyone who complimented her to derogation.\n\nRegardless of her enormous success and being second-in-command to Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, Sheryl still found it rigorous and laborious to proclaim her deserving acclamation.\n\nProfessional ambition is expected of men, but is fervently considered negative for women. 'She is very ambitious' is not a compliment to women.\n\nRead: The imposter syndrome\n\nAggressive and hard-charging women violate unwritten rules about acceptable social conduct. Men are continually applauded for being determined, powerful and successful, but women who convey these traits often pay a social penalty.\n\nDuring a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner at Facebook headquarters, Secretary Geithner’s team, consisting of women, sat on the chairs off to the side of the boardroom table.\n\nSheryl, Facebook’s chief operating officer, motioned to the women to sit at the table.\n\nRead: My endless battle with imposter syndrome\n\nThey demurred and remained on their seats. During her six-and-a-half years managing online sales and operations groups at Google from 2001 to 2007, Sheryl hired a team of 4,000 employees and starkly scrutinised how women faced obstacles from within.\n\nInstead of feeling worthy of recognition, they felt undeserving and guilty. This is despite being lofty achievers and experts in their fields. Most women don't seem to obliterate the detrimental sense that it's only a matter of time before they are exposed for impostors with limited abilities.\n\nGenetic remnants and negative psychological strokes of oppression have caused women to feel unworthy of their success.\n\nSheryl Sandberg's book.\nPhoto credit: Photo I Pool\n\nThis phenomenon of capable people being plagued by self-doubt is called impostor syndrome. In her inspirational book, Lean in: Women Work and the Will to Lead, Sheryl states that both men and women are susceptible to impostor syndrome, but due to women being historically subjected to subjugation, they disproportionately experience it more intensely.\n\nMultiple studies in numerous industries indicate that women often judge their own performance as worse than it actually is, while men judge their own performance as better than it is.\n\nRead: Unseen battle with imposter syndrome\n\nStudying at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, every time Sheryl was called upon in class, she concluded she was about to embarrass herself.\n\nWhen she took a test, she was certain that she would flank, and whenever she excelled without embarrassing herself, she believed that she had fooled everyone yet again. Like so many perceptions, lack of confidence can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nWhen a man is asked to explain his success, he will typically credit his own innate qualities. When a woman is asked the same question, she will attribute her success to external factors, insisting she did well because she “worked really hard,” “got lucky,” or “had help from contemporaries.”\n\nDuring her term at Google, whenever Sheryl announced the launch of a new project, the men banged on her door to explain why they should lead the charge. Men were also more likely to chase a growth opportunity.\n\nRead: Imposter syndrome: How to ensure your staff do not wallow in self-doubt\n\nIn situations where men and women each received negative feedback, Sheryl watched women’s self-confidence and self-esteem drop significantly. The internalisation of failure and the insecurity it breeds intercepts future performance in women more and this pattern has profound, extended consequences.\n\nWorsening women’s progress is the societal pressure for women to keep an eye on marriage from a young age. As much as Sheryl's parents esteemed academic achievements, they emphasised marriage even more.\n\nWhen she joined Harvard at 19, they had already implanted in her psyche that eligible women marry young to acquire a 'good man' before they are all taken.\n\nSheryl obediently complied with their advice and during her time at Harvard, she vetted every date as a potential husband and in turn, ruined every date.\n\nAfter graduation, she rejected the idea of international fellowship on the grounds that a foreign country was not a likely place to turn a date into a husband. Instead, she relocated to Washington, DC, which was full of eligible men.\n\nAt the age of 24, in her first year out of Harvard, she met a man who was not just eligible, but also pleasant and married him.\n\nThe relationship quickly unravelled and by the age of 25, she was divorced. At the time, this felt like a massive personal and public failure.\n\nFor many years, she felt that no matter what she accomplished professionally, it paled in comparison to the punitive and inescapable spell of marriage. The result of such polarisation by society on women is that countless women subconsciously view ‘ambition’ as a dirty word.\n\nThe writer is a novelist, Big Brother Africa 2 Kenyan representative and founder of Jeff's Fitness Centre (@jeffbigbrother).\n\n", "author": "By \nJeff Anthony", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/899246/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/33bcd99317d8a2f20b537ac7aba9b22a/jr/sandberg.jpg", "image_description": "Sheryl Sandberg, former COO of Facebook, speaks during a panel discussion at the Clinton Global Initiative meeting on September 24, 2013, in New York City. \nPhoto credit: File | AFP", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-16T03:00:00Z"}

It is all happening before the one-eyed world,\" Ayman Rajab, a resident of western Jabalia, said via a chat app.\n\nIsrael had said its forces cleared Jabalia months earlier in the Gaza war, triggered by the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, but said last week it was returning to prevent Islamist militants re-grouping there.\n\nIn southern Gaza bordering Egypt, thick smoke rose over Rafah, where an escalating Israeli assault has sent hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from what was one of the few remaining places of refuge.\n\n\"People are terrified and they're trying to get away,\" Jens Laerke, U.N. humanitarian office spokesperson, said in Geneva, adding that most were following orders to move north towards the coast but that there were no safe routes or destinations.\n\nAs the fighting raged, the U.S. military said trucks started moving aid ashore from a temporary pier, the first to reach the besieged enclave by sea in weeks.\n\nThe World Food Programme, which expects food, water, shelter and medical supplies to arrive through the floating dock, said the aid was transported to its warehouses in Deir Al Balah in central Gaza and told partners it was ready for distribution.\n\nThe United Nations earlier reiterated that truck convoys by land - disrupted this month by the assault on Rafah - were still the most efficient way of getting aid in.\n\n\"To stave off the horrors of famine, we must use the fastest and most obvious route to reach the people of Gaza – and for that, we need access by land now,\" deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said.\n\nU.S. aid was arriving in Cyprus for delivery to Gaza via the new pier, Washington said.\n\nHamas demanded an end to Israel's siege and accused Washington of complicity with an Israeli policy of \"starvation and blockade\".\n\nThe White House said US national security adviser Jake Sullivan would visit Israel on Sunday and stress the need for a targeted offensive against Hamas militants rather than a full-scale assault on Rafah.\n\nA group of U.S. medical workers left the Gaza Strip after getting stuck at the hospital where they were providing care, the White House said.\n\nHumanitarian fears\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said troops killed more than 60 militants in Jabalia in recent days and located a weapons warehouse in a \"divisional-level offensive\".\n\nA divisional operation would typically involve several brigades of thousands of troops each, making it one of the biggest of the war.\n\n\"The 7th Brigade's fire control centre directed dozens of airstrikes, eliminated terrorists and destroyed terrorist infrastructure,\" the IDF said.\n\nAt least 35,303 Palestinians have now been killed, according to figures from the enclave's health ministry, while aid agencies have warned repeatedly of widespread hunger and dire shortages of fuel and medical supplies.\n\nIsrael says it must capture Rafah to destroy Hamas and ensure the country's safety. In the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 1,200 people died in Israel and 253 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. About 128 hostages are still being held in Gaza.\n\nIsrael said on Friday that its forces retrieved the bodies of three people killed at the Nova music festival in Israel on Oct. 7 and taken into Gaza.\n\nIn response, Hamas said negotiations were the only way for Israel to retrieve hostages alive: \"The enemy will not get its prisoners except as lifeless corpses or through an honourable exchange deal for our people and our resistance.\"\n\nTalks on a ceasefire have been at an impasse.\n\n'Tragic war'\n\nIsraeli tanks and warplanes bombarded parts of Rafah on Friday, while the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired anti-tank missiles and mortars at forces massing to the east, southeast and inside the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.\n\nUNRWA, the main U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, said more than 630,000 people had fled Rafah since the offensive began on May 6.\n\n\"They're moving to areas where there is no water - we've got to truck it in - and people aren't getting enough food,\" Sam Rose, director of planning at UNRWA, told Reuters on Friday by telephone from Rafah, where he said it was eerily quiet.\n\nAt the International Court of Justice, or World Court, in The Hague, where South Africa has accused Israel of violating the Genocide Convention, Israeli Justice Ministry official Gilad Noam defended the operation.\n\nThe South African legal team, which set out its case for fresh emergency measures the previous day, framed the Israeli military operation as part of a genocidal plan aimed at bringing about the destruction of the Palestinian people.\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Saturday, May 18, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4626724/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/447d367a1ec361d6997360a295639b25/dK/israeli-soldier.jpg", "image_description": "An Israeli soldier boards a vehicle, as military operations continue in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, at the Memorial Monument ha-Plada in Kerem Shalom, Israel, May 17, 2024. \nPhoto credit: Shannon Stapleton | Reuters", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-18T05:59:34Z"}
{"title": "Government allocates Sh500m to build 17 footbridges in Nairobi", "content": "The government has allocated Sh500 million for construction of 17 footbridges in Nairobi after the floods that devastated the city swept away or destroyed most of them.\n\nJustus Onyikwa, a deputy director at the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA), said the agency has prioritized Nairobi for rehabilitation.\n\nHowever, they are committed to addressing roadwork, particularly in areas where they were washed out, ensuring prompt attention and maintenance.\n\n“The estimated cost of completing the work on the 17 footbridges is around Sh500 million. Currently, their concentration is solely on Nairobi, before rolling out repair across the country. We will attend to all roads even as we try to secure extra funds to cover all the affected areas,” Mr Onyikwa told Sunday Nation.\n\nHe estimated the damage to bridges as exceeding 80 percent.\n\nRoads and Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen this week said the government needs between Sh25 billion and Sh30 billion to restore critical infrastructure destroyed by floods.\n\n“We are heavily impacted by the floods and have lost infrastructure, especially roads and bridges. From our assessment, we estimate that between Sh25 billion and Sh30 billion is needed for restoration,” said Murkomen.\n\nThe CS was speaking while assessing the state of the Gamba section of the Lamu-Witu-Garsen road that was swept away by floods on May, 15, 2024.\n\n“We need a lot of money to rehabilitate our roads and bridges,” he stressed adding that “an assessment of the damage is almost complete. We will talk to Parliament to set aside the necessary resources.”\n\nAccording to Mr Onyikwa, they will prioritise Mathare, Kamukunji, Kibra, Embakasi South, Kabete, Langata, and Westlands constituencies. These areas have been identified as high-priority due to their large populations and the urgent need for safe crossing points over oft-dangerous rivers.\n\n“We are concentrating on the densely populated regions. This includes the Jerusalem neighbourhood along the Nairobi River, which is heavily populated. Other key areas also require improved access to services considering majority of those affected are school children and commuters. The original bridges in these locations were washed away, so we are rebuilding them from the ground up,” he said.\n\nMr Onyikwa further said that they are reconstructing bridges spanning around 50 meters, aiming to enhance their clearance and bring them up to standard.\n\n“Initially, these bridges were [a basic] two rows, serving as small crossings at designated places. Now, we are improving and increasing their clearance while ensuring they meet required standards. Since the floods compromised the integrity of the bridges’ supports, we are building new bridges in some areas and elimination others, which were already in a state of disrepair,” he said.\n\nFootbridges being reconstructed are, Gitathuru-Wanjiru Footbridge, Mandera-Koria Footbridge, Lungalunga-Viwandani Footbridge, and Mosque Road Footbridge, Ngumba Bridge, Huruma (Ghetto area) Footbridge, and Madoya Bridge, which are vital connections within their respective communities.\n\nOthers ate the Gitathuru-Utalii Hotel Footbridge, Kisii Footbridge, and Kiambiu-Uhuru Bridge, Ruthimitu-Uthiru Bridge, Nyando Bridge, Sarang’ombe Footbridge, Sarang’ombe Motorable Bridge and of course, the Mumwe Road Box Culvert.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nMercy Simiyu", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3485652/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/b7f6f8358fc18d6896eca0570791d24d/hr/hawkers7.jpg", "image_description": "A section of the Muthaiga footbridge on Thika road in Nairobi.\nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-19T04:01:12Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "Students who will begin their third, fourth, fifth and sixth years of studies in September in four universities are at risk of dropping out after the National Treasury failed to allocate any funds for their studies.\n\nThe 2024-2025 Budget Policy Statement had allocated the University of Nairobi Sh1.725 billion, Moi University Sh1.3 billion, University of Eldoret Sh702.7 million and University of Kabianga Sh339.6 million.\n\nHowever, when the budget estimates were published, the four universities had zero allocation for their thousands of students.\n\nThe government has also not allocated any funds for research, feasibility studies, project preparation and design although the BPS had allocated Sh7.9 million.\n\nThe estimates are also silent on the financing of students in private universities who are sponsored by the government.\n\nRead: Why Egerton University’s survival lies in enrolment of more students\n\nAdditionally, the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb) has a financing deficit of Sh11.4 billion in the 2024-2025 estimates.\n\nWith the deficit, Helb can fund all continuing students and only 17.2 per cent of the students who will be joining university in September.\n\nThe proposed allocation for tuition loans and upkeep for the freshmen who will join university in September is Sh2.4 billion.\n\nThis proposed allocation can only fund 21,512 students, implying that 101,122 students (82.5 per cent) will not get tuition and upkeep loans.\n\nPublic universities have over Sh76 billion in accumulated pending bills and the budget cuts may compromise their financial health.\n\nAccording to the auditor-General, 23 out of the 40 public universities and their constituent university colleges are technically insolvent. The government also owes private universities in excess of Sh31 billion.\n\nRead: Graduates from private varsities denied certificates as institutions demand Sh31.4bn\n\nFurther, 31 public universities are unable to settle their pending bills and debts. For example, on May 13, the management of Kenyatta University sent out a memo to all staff stating that it was unable to pay their salaries because it had not received the April capitation from the government.\n\nTreasury has also reduced the budgets for the National Research Fund, Commission for University Education and National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation.\n\nThe universities have not been allocated any funds for foreign travel, subsistence and other transportation costs. As a result, the State Department for Higher Education has appealed to the National Assembly for extra funding.\n\n“The current funding is not adequate for mobilising inputs such as teaching and learning materials, equipment, and adequate staffing to deliver programmes that meet the highest quality standards. A further reduction in funding would severely constrain the growth of the new generation universities,” it states in its submission to the National Assembly’s Education and Research committee.\n\n“The higher education sub-sector relies heavily on human resources to deliver on its mandate. A significant reduction on the budgetary allocation implies that universities will not meet their payroll costs. There is a high risk of students and staff going on strike, which will threaten the stability of universities,” it adds.\n\nThe universities with the largest allocations are Maseno (Sh1.7 billion), Kenyatta (Sh1.4 billion), Kirinyaga (Sh1.1 billion), Chuka (Sh867 million) and Masinde Muliro (Sh853 million).\n\nRead: Professor drought - How to address the biting crisis in Kenyan universities\n\nLast year, the government introduced a new university funding model under which students’ education will be through scholarships, loans and bursaries.\n\nThe students receive financing depending on their level of need as determined by a means testing instrument.\n\nHowever, students who were admitted before the model was introduced will continue to be financed through the differentiated unit cost model. It is this model that has inadequate funding.\n\nWhereas the government was to fund each cost of a degree programme at 80 per cent, this has reduced 42.6 per cent.\n\nWorryingly, if Parliament adopts the budget proposals with the current budgetary allocation, universities will only get 30 per cent of the cost of their programmes.\n\nUniversity students should also brace themselves for reduced student loans after Helb was allocated Sh28.1 billion in the budget estimates against the Sh31.89 billion allocated in the BPS.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nDavid Muchunguh", "date": "Friday, May 17, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4625522/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/c100bbbab97334cc9f70382098c0f7b9/mq/moi-university.jpg", "image_description": "Students walk outside the Moi University administration block in Kesses, Uasin Gishu County on February 8, 2024.

{"title": "Iranian President Raisi: A hardliner on morality, protests and nuclear talks", "content": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, whose helicopter crashed in mountainous terrain on Sunday, has become a contender to be Iran's next supreme leader with a clampdown on morality questions and a bloody crackdown on the nationwide protests it triggered.\n\nRaisi's victory in an election in 2021, after heavyweight conservative and moderate rivals were disqualified by a hardline oversight body, brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners loyal to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Raisi's 85-year-old mentor, who has the final say on all major policies.\n\nRaisi, 63, took a tough stance in now-moribund negotiations with six major powers to revive a 2015 nuclear deal, seeing a chance to win broad relief from US sanctions in return for only modest curbs on Iran's increasingly advanced nuclear programme.\n\nHardliners in Iran have been emboldened by the chaotic U.S. military withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan and policy swings in Washington.\n\nIn 2018, then-U.S. president Donald Trump had reneged on the deal Tehran had done with the six powers and restored harsh U.S. sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to progressively violate the agreement's nuclear limits.\n\nIndirect talks between US President Joe Biden's administration and Tehran to revive the pact have stalled.\n\nHardline position\n\nRaisi's hardline position has also been evident in domestic politics; a year after his election, the mid-ranking cleric ordered that authorities tighten enforcement of Iran's \"hijab and chastity law\" restricting women's dress and behaviour.\n\nWithin weeks, a young Kurdish Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, died in custody after being arrested by morality police for allegedly violating that law.\n\nThe resulting months of nationwide protests presented one of the gravest challenges to Iran's clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nHundreds were killed, according to rights groups, including dozens of security personnel who were part of a fierce crackdown on the demonstrators. \"Acts of chaos are unacceptable,\" the president insisted.\n\nAlthough a political novice, Raisi has had full backing for the nuclear stance and the security crackdown from his patron, the strongly anti-Western Khamenei.\n\nHowever, the widespread protests against clerical rule and a failure to turn around Iran's struggling economy - hamstrung by Western sanctions and mismanagement - may have diminished his popularity at home.\n\n'Pillar of the system'\n\nAs a young prosecutor in Tehran, Raisi sat on a panel that oversaw the execution of hundreds of political prisoners in the Iranian capital in 1988, as Iran's eight-year war with Iraq was coming to an end, rights groups say.\n\nInquisitions known as \"death committees\" were set up across Iran comprising religious judges, prosecutors and intelligence ministry officials to decide the fate of thousands of detainees in arbitrary trials that lasted just a few minutes, according to a report by Amnesty International.\n\nWhile the number of people killed across Iran was never confirmed, Amnesty said minimum estimates put it at 5,000.\n\nAsked about allegations that he had played a part in the death sentences, Raisi told reporters in 2021: \"If a judge, a prosecutor, has defended the security of the people, he should be praised ... I am proud to have defended human rights in every position I have held so far.\"\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Iran's Shi'ite Muslim clergy and was appointed by Khamenei to the high-profile job of judiciary chief in 2019. Shortly afterwards, he was also elected deputy chairman of the Assembly of Experts, the 88-member clerical body responsible for electing the next Supreme Leader.\n\n\"Raisi is a pillar of a system that jails, tortures and kills people for daring to criticize state policies,\" said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of New York-based advocacy group the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI). Iran denies torturing prisoners.\n\nRaisi shares with Khamenei a deep suspicion of the West. An anti-corruption populist, he backs Khamenei's self-sufficiency drive in the economy and his strategy of supporting proxy forces across the Middle East.\n\nWhen a missile attack killed senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers in Iran's embassy in Damascus in April, Iran responded with an unprecedented but largely unsuccessful direct aerial bombardment of Israel.\n\nZionist regime\"\n\nRaisi said that any Israeli retaliation against Iranian territory could result in there being nothing left of the \"Zionist regime\".\n\n\"Raisi is someone that Khamenei trusts,\" said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Program. \"Raisi can protect the supreme leader's legacy.\n\nRaisi served as deputy head of the judiciary for 10 years before being appointed prosecutor-general in 2014. Five years later, the United States imposed sanctions on him for human rights violations, including the 1980s executions.\n\nSeeking the presidency, Raisi lost to the pragmatist Hassan Rouhani in a 2017 election. His failure was widely attributed to an audio tape dating from 1988 that surfaced in 2016 and purportedly highlighted his role in the 1988 executions.\n\nIn the recording, the late Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, then deputy supreme leader, spoke of the killings. Montazeri’s son was arrested and jailed for releasing the tape.\n\nRaisi was born in 1960 to a religious family in Iran's holy Shi'ite Muslim city of Mashhad. He lost his father at the age of 5, but followed in his footsteps to become a cleric.\n\nAs a young student at a religious seminary in the holy city of Qom, Raisi took part in protests against the Western-backed Shah in the 1979 revolution. Later, his contacts with religious leaders in Qom made him a trusted figure in the judiciary.\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4628402/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/4ee8dd907078e0b4a3ecf2a850d5be92/qM/ebrahim-raisi.jpg", "image_description": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi looks on during a TV interview, in Tehran, Iran May 7, 2024.  \nPhoto credit: Reuters", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-19T18:37:56Z"}

I therefore find the counterclaim proved to that extent and I award the respondents Sh 88,100,” ruled Justice Hellen Wasilwa, sitting at the Nakuru Employment and Labour Relations Court.\n\nIn his petition filed on April 13, 2022, Dr Musa claimed to have been employed by the hospital on January 1, 2021, as a resident Medical Doctor for a two-year renewable contract on a monthly salary of Sh130,000.\n\nHe told the court that he served diligently for eight months before the hospital stopped remitting his salary for September before he decided to resign the following month for the said reasons.\n\nHe claimed to have served his notice via email, which he served before leaving the employment.\n\nThe hospital denied the claims by the doctor, who it said resigned on his own volition after getting another job.\n\nThe court heard that the doctor was employed when the industry was going through the unprecedented Covid-19 period, which caused the hospital to undergo serious cash flow challenges occasioned by the reduction in outpatient utilization, hospital admissions, decline of hospital claims by third parties as well as delay in remittance of payments by the insurance providers overwhelmed by unprecedented claims.\n\nThe hospital said the challenges were brought to the attention of all staff, and three options were issued, including declaration of redundancy, voluntary resignation or delayed salary.\n\nThe court heard that the doctor refused to sign the discharge voucher to allow for dues owed to him to be processed. He was also accused of sending unsigned resignation letters via email after he had exited the job.\n\nThe hospital further filed a counterclaim inviting the court to look at elements of breach of employment contract by the doctor, who it said failed to serve his contractual notice, signing an unsigned resignation letter after exiting work and failing to submit clearance forms. He also failed to sign the discharge voucher of terminal dues and didn't give one month's notice as agreed in the employment contract.\n\nThe court found that the doctor had resigned of his own volition upon receiving another job at Taita Taveta County and not because of frustration by the hospital.\n\nJustice Wasilwa further dismissed the claim for wrongful dismissal for lack of merit and awarded the hospital the damages plus the interests at court rates from the date of judgment.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nJoseph Openda", "date": "Friday, May 10, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4559836/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/13d0afaae180c8c99d892700ccf70bf6/JZ/gavel.jpg", "image_description": "Nakuru doctor who sought Sh2m from employer asked to pay Sh90,000 for breach of contract\nPhoto credit: Shutterstock", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-10T14:00:42Z"}
{"title": "UNEA-6 resolutions: The key points and implications", "content": "After a week of negotiations at the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), delegates left with resolutions and decisions to guide countries on critical environmental issues. This year, there were 19 resolutions under consideration, but only 15 made it to the final document passed during the Assembly. Two decisions and a ministerial declaration were also passed. Here is a breakdown of each resolution and its implications for countries worldwide.\n\nEnvironmental aspects of minerals and metals\n\nNegotiations for this resolution started in 2019 at UNEA-4, where the main discussion was mineral resource governance. Progress was shared at UNEA-5, and this year, countries agreed on the new aspects of the resolution.\n\nThe final draft decision now encourages countries to develop regulations to promote sustainable consumption and production of metals and minerals. They must ensure a complete cycle for mineral management as guided in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agenda aims to reduce any arising negative impacts of minerals and metals on the environment, society and economy.\n\nHaitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry(left),President William Ruto(centre), and United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen after attending the 6th Session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) at the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Headquarters in Nairobi on February 29, 2024.\nPhoto credit: EVANS HABIL\n\n\n\nCircularity of a resilient, low-carbon sugar cane agro-industry\n\nThis resolution was tabled in 2019 but concluded this year. With the knowledge that sugarcane is farmed in some 80 countries worldwide, including Kenya, negotiators acknowledged that climate change will grossly affect the industry. During the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (COP28) in Dubai last year, countries launched the International Alliance for the Circularity of a Resilient and Low-carbon Sugar Cane agro-industry. This helped propel this resolution to fruition this year.\n\nRead: UNEA meeting on climate change kicks off in Nairobi with focus on plastics\n\nAmendments to the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured Global Environment Facility\n\nThis resolution will ensure that the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) headquartered in Nairobi, will have a stronger mandate in implementing environmental policies under the Global Environment Facility. The facility will ensure inclusivity, transparency, accountability and responsiveness for the projects and programmes under it by ensuring eligibility for] financing global projects is followed to the letter.\n\nEnhancing the role and viability of regional forums of environment ministers and Unep regional offices in achieving multilateral cooperation in tackling environmental challenges\n\nIts objective is to encourage discussion and collaboration among nations to address environmental challenges within their territories. The outcome of this effort will be reviewed during the next UNEA in 2026, where a stocktake will be conducted to assess how countries have incorporated regional forums and environmental authorities in their efforts.\n\nPromoting synergies, cooperation or collaboration for national implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and other relevant environmental instruments\n\nA recently released report, Global Resources Outlook 2024 during the UNEA-6 event showed that humans are using up available resources at an unsustainable rate. It highlights the need for equitable resource-sharing among individuals and nations. To achieve this, countries must improve their knowledge and understanding of the potential benefits of collaboration. This can be accomplished by intensifying efforts to gather and share best practices and promoting information exchange.\n\nFoster national action to address global environmental challenges through increased cooperation between the UNEA, the Unep and multilateral environmental agreements.\n\nAfter a resolution has been passed by the UNEA, the responsibility of implementing the decisions usually falls on individual countries. While some countries may act promptly, others may take longer to implement the decisions. This resolution encourages all countries to act swiftly and efficiently when complying with multilateral environmental agreements.\n\nRead: UNEA cure for ‘triple crisis’\n\nCombating sand and dust storms\n\nDuring the closing plenary, UNEA-6 Leila Benali stated that sand and dust storms were deadly phenomena that often go unnoticed. Therefore, it is crucial to bring awareness to this issue. Sand and dust storms have been increasing globally, with approximately two billion tons of sand and dust entering the atmosphere each year, according to a report by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The resolution highlights Africa and Asia as the most affected regions, particularly in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-regions. The resolution proposes coordinated action to address this challenge and potentially reduce its impact.\n\nPromoting sustainable lifestyles\n\nThis resolution demands that countries implement it at the community level, which requires a change in current standards of living. It must be included in the existing program known as the One Planet Network Programme on Sustainable Lifestyles and Education. Unep will need to provide resources to countries, especially for the educational skills necessary to make this shift.\n\nSound management of chemicals and waste\n\nMany countries have been raising concerns about the issue of pollution, which has been causing negative impacts on people's health. Despite being an existing problem, it has been largely ignored. To address this, a resolution was passed by the World Health Assembly last year, which calls for a discussion during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to promote a Global Framework on Chemicals. This resolution aims to manage and tackle pollution more effectively.\n\nPresident of UN General Assembly Dennis Francis addressing journalists at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi on February 29, 2024 during the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6).\nPhoto credit: EVANS HABIL| NMG\n\nPromote regional cooperation on air pollution to improve air quality globally\n\nThere are regulations to address air pollution, but there is still a need to enhance air quality further. The latest resolution acknowledges that air pollution not only affects individuals but also leads to the loss of biodiversity. The Assembly recognises that addressing air pollution would result in numerous benefits. Additionally, taking care of air quality could positively impact climate change.\n\nRead: UNEA-6: Countries reject solar engineering as way to combat climate change\n\nManage highly hazardous pesticides\n\nThis resolution supports the one passed by the previous UN General Assembly and the one from last year’s World Health Assembly. It highlights the dangers of leaving highly hazardous pesticides unmanaged, which can put people at risk of harm. Therefore, countries are urged to take intentional steps to reduce associated risks. They are also encouraged to conduct studies that can help minimise damage from such pesticides or find alternative and less harmful sources.\n\nEnvironmental assistance and recovery in areas affected by armed conflict\n\nDespite the triple planetary crisis that the world is facing, other crises, such as war, continue to disrupt everyday life. In areas affected by armed conflict, people tend to focus solely on the war and overlook other underlying issues, such as the environment. This resolution aims to address this by promoting a comprehensive and sustainable approach to managing the challenges faced by conflict-affected regions.\n\nStrengthening ocean efforts to tackle climate change, marine biodiversity loss and pollution\n\nThere is a growing concern about the health of oceans around the world. Studies conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have revealed that climate change significantly impacts the ocean and that the situation may worsen as temperatures continue to rise. To address this issue, several agreements and strategies have been put forward, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships.\n\nEffective and inclusive solutions for strengthening water policies to achieve sustainable development in the context of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.\n\nWater is a resource that has often caused conflicts between different countries and communities, as it transcends boundaries, and no single entity can claim ownership of it. Despite this, the world must continue to work towards achieving sustainable development goals related to water. During a recent meeting, delegates expressed concern about the dwindling quantity and quality of water resources worldwide. They encouraged countries to dialogue about collaborating on water-related issues, including local and indigenous knowledge. The progress made on this critical issue will be discussed at the next Assembly.\n\nStrengthening international efforts to combat desertification and land degradation, restore degraded land, promote land conservation and sustainable land management, contribute to land degradation neutrality and enhance drought resilience\n\nClimate change has led to an increase in desertification. However, land degradation is mainly caused by changes in land use. Notably, a large portion of the earth's land is arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid. Restoring these lands can help create a more sustainable economy for those who rely on them. This approach integrates various factors and promotes a holistic approach to land management.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nHellen Shikanda", "date": "Tuesday, March 05, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4546388/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/2f1dbff5a8f1456e9bfaf346c586215/WD/unea-6-pic1.jpg", "image_description": "President William Ruto delivering his remarks at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi on February 29, 2024 during the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6).\nPhoto credit: EVANS HABIL| NMG", "category": "other", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-03-05T14:56:57Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "While sentencing Joseph Kuria Irungu alias Jowie to death for the murder of Monica Kimani, High Court judge Grace Nzioka said the killing was intentional and it was not as a result of provocation.\n\nThe judge added that it is not that Jowie did not have an opportunity to reflect on his actions before committing the offence because it was premeditated, planned and executed with subsequent destruction of evidence.\n\nIn the judge’s view, the offender deserves no mercy for what he had done to the victim.\n\nRead:  Sent to hang: Jowie, choir boy who played guitar in church, starts long chapter in jail\n\nAfter the death sentence what next for Jowie?\n\nHis lawyer Andrew Muge said he would appeal against both the sentence and the conviction, as provided for in law within 14 days from the date of the judgement.\n\nAccording to Mr Muge, the prosecution failed to give exculpatory evidence (evidence that would have absolved him of the offence), including the photographs of a pair of shorts he allegedly wore on the night of September 19, 2018.\n\nThe lawyer said Jowie wore a pair of brown khaki shorts, with side pockets. But the one produced in court, and which linked him to the murder- as blood samples collected on it were Monica’s- were different.\n\nHe said DNA results found on the straps that were used to tie Monica, showed that there were two unknown males, who accessed the house.\n\nRead: The 13 determinants that nailed Jowie to murder charge\n\nMr Muge further said they will also be raising the issue of the time recorded at the entrance to Lamuria Gardens Apartment. He said there was contradictory evidence as to whether he left the house at 9pm or 11pm.\n\nWill Jowie face the hangman?\n\nKenya has not executed anyone on death row since 1987 when Hezekiah Ochuka and Pancras Oteyo Okumu were hanged for their role in the attempted coup.\n\nReports published by lobby groups, who have sought for the abolishment of the death penalty state that from independence in 1963 to 1987, only 280 persons out of 3,584 people sentenced to death, were executed in Kenya.\n\nIn 2009, President Mwai Kibaki commuted the sentences of more than 4,000 convicts from death to life imprisonment. His successor Uhuru Kenyatta commuted the sentences of another 2,747 in 2016 to life imprisonment.\n\nRead: The mysterious life of Joseph 'Jowie’ Irungu\n\nThe latest commutations were done by President William Ruto in July last year, of all death sentences from November 21, 2022, to life imprisonment as recommended by the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (POMAC).\n\nPOMAC is chaired by Attorney General Justin Muturi and derives its powers from The Power of Mercy Act 2011, which allows the President to grant a free or conditional pardon to a person convicted of an offence.\n\nWhat does the death sentence mean?\n\nDeath in Kenya is carried out by hanging. Under section 332(3) of the criminal procedure code, a death warrant must be issued and signed by the President for the death to be carried out. The warrant must also state the place and time of the execution. The death warrant must also provide directions as to the place of burial or cremation of the body of the person to be executed.\n\nWhat other offences carry a death sentence?\n\nThe penal code imposes a death sentence for the offences of murder, treason, robbery with violence, attempted robbery with violence and administration of unlawful oaths to commit capital offences and the International Crimes Act.\n\nHave there been attempts to abolish the death sentence?\n\nYes. Several human rights groups have argued for the abolishment of the death sentence. In 2017, the Supreme Court declared the mandatory nature of the death sentence unconstitutional. With the quashing of the section, judges hearing capital offences have the discretion to impose the sentence they deem appropriate after considering the gravity of the offence and the mitigation of the offender.\n\nThe top court judges said a person facing the death sentence is most deserving to be heard in mitigation because of the finality of the sentence.\n\nRead: Why Kenya has not abolished the death penalty\n\nWhat does a life sentence mean?\n\nIn Kenya, it is assumed that the life sentence means the number of years of the prisoner’s natural life, which ceases upon his or her death. Lobbyists, however, want this to be abolished and Parliament to come up with minimum and maximum sentences for serious offences such as murder, robbery with violence and attempted robbery with violence.\n\nThe lobby groups argue that a life sentence is also punitive and defeats the whole purpose of sending prisoners to jail- of rehabilitating them. They argue that keeping them in jail until they pass on, is also expensive given that a prisoner spends more money for their upkeep in prison.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined an invitation by two convicts to define what constitutes a life sentence. Instead, the six judges of the apex court (Justice Mohammed Ibrahim had been indisposed) directed the Attorney General and Parliament to commence an enquiry and develop legislation on the definition of what constitutes a life sentence.\n\nWhat has Parliament done so far?\n\nMPs have been mulling over abolishing the death sentence and replacing it with life imprisonment, by amending the Penal Code Act. The Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2023, pushed by the leader of majority in the National Assembly Opiyo Wandayi seeks to erase the imposition of the death sentence against capital offenders.\n\nThe Bill is currently before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) of the National Assembly for prepublication scrutiny.\n\nMr Wandayi said abolishing the death penalty will help to preserve the fundamental right to life under Article 26 of the Constitution and put an end to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment of condemned persons, occasioned by the enforcement of the death penalty. The MP added that the abolishment of the death penalty will also stop the psychological trauma that convicts go through.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nSam Kiplagat", "date": "Thursday, March 14, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4555662/portrait_ratio1x1/320/180/704141493eb00b6832028b303352e116/Mm/jowie-1.jpg", "image_description": " ", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-03-14T15:00:12Z"}

{"title": "Charity groups in court battle over use of children's images to solicit donor funding", "content": "A legal battle at the Kwale Law Courts is set to expose the tricks used by some local charitable organisations to raise funds from abroad, as the fate of a school in the county hangs in the balance.\n\nIn the case, two complainants have sued a Belgian investor, accusing her of using their charity, which helps the poor and young mothers in Kwale, to enrich herself.\n\nMs Sarah Were and Jan Francois are seeking the closure of Tabasamu School, which they claim is being run by a Belgian national, Ann De Bruyn, using funds donated to their charity.\n\nThey allege that the foreigner has used deception to profit from overseas donor funds to run her businesses.\n\nThrough a lawyer, Mogaka Elkana, Ms Were and Mr Francois have alleged that Ms Bruyn has been posing as a member of their Kebene Children's Home and Group & Rotaract Global to obtain funds from the public and unjustly enrich herself.\n\nChildren’s image rights\n\n“Ms Bruyn has been using images of the children that are at Kebene’s custody without the children’s image rights, to fraudulently obtain funds from investors to unjustly enrich herself and unlawful interference with the organisation’s children's economic interest,” claimed Mr Mogaka.\n\nAccording to the complainants, Ms Bruyn has been using the children's images without the consent of the children's home, who are the guardians of the minors, causing harm and exploitation to the young ones.\n\nThe entrance to the Kabene Children's Home in Diani, Kwale County on May 9, 2024.\nPhoto credit: Siago Cece | Nation Media Group\n\n“Unless she is compelled to cease the usage of the children’s images to obtain funds from investors and impersonate Kabene, then there is a likelihood of child abuse, injury and exploitation to the children,” they say in their submission.\n\nRead: Court orders evacuation of 30 minors from rescue centre\n\nCourt documents show Ms Were is the manager of Kebene Children's Home and Group & Rotaract Global, a small-scale project that provides shelter to street children and orphans in Kenya as a Children's Home regulated by the Children's Act.\n\nThe records further show that Ms Bruyn became part of the organisation as a volunteer on or about July 2022, when she offered to sponsor some of the children.\n\nThe court heard that in the same year, Ms Bruyn started talking to the organisation’s staff, inciting them against the children’s home and taking photographs of the children.\n\nSolicit money\n\nMs Were and Mr Francois say they later learnt that the Belgian had been using the children's images she took when she visited the premises to solicit money from investors to fund the opening of her school, Tabasamu.\n\n“We later on learnt that she has incited three of our staff members to leave the organisation, and steal money that was meant for groceries and the feeding of the children,” they claimed.\n\nThey also alleged that Ms Bruyn went ahead and opened her institution with the three staff members she poached from the children’s home using the royalties she got from the children's photograph that she does not have a copyright to.\n\n“She opened the learning institution with malicious intent to unjustly enrich herself from investors and well-wishers and not to help children,” they told the court.\n\nThey lament that despite the Belgian being made aware of her actions and asked to return the children's images and stop obtaining funds in the name of the children’s home, she has ignored and, or refused to do so.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuit, Ms Were and Mr Francois have also written to the Belgian Embassy regarding the issue.\n\nAccording to the letter, the school was to financially support Kenyan citizens by covering housing, student fees, and other welfare and education-related expenses, distributing food parcels and providing first aid and hygiene support.\n\nMake profit\n\nHowever, contrary to these objectives, it is alleged that Tabasamu has registered a business in Kenya under the Business Name Mwana Tabasamu Christina Academy to make a profit.\n\n“It is without doubt that Tabasamu registered in Belgium is disguised as a charitable organisation to solicit funds from Belgian citizens to advance private business interests in Diani, Kenya through Mwana Tabasamu Christina Academy,” said the letter.\n\nRead: Is sending your child to a rehabilitation school the solution?\n\nHowever, in her defence, Ms Bruyn said that she became a sponsor of the children's home in July 2021 by assisting a young mother before being illegally expelled from the organisation a year later due to her disagreement with the founder, Pasci Priscen.\n\nShe explained that things escalated in July 2022 when she raised concerns about the utilisation of a 250 Euro donation (Sh28,905 by the current exchange rates) - received from her friends in Belgium, who requested pictures of what she had purchased for the children.\n\n\"However, Priscen became upset and insisted that I transfer the money to the children's home's bank account, which I complied with. I was dissatisfied with his response to my concerns since the 250 Euro donation from my Belgian friends was not used for its intended purpose,\" she stated.\n\nMs Bruyn refuted all accusations against her. She acknowledged taking pictures of the children but explained that she did so after obtaining permission from the organisation's founder.\n\n“Priscen allowed volunteers and sponsors to take unlimited photographs to aid in sourcing donations. The unauthorised photography of children is inaccurately claimed to occur when a sponsor or volunteer departs or raises concerns about donation usage within the organisation,” she stated through Chimera, Kamotho Advocates LLP.\n\nShe refuted any involvement in using children's images for fundraising or influencing investors, asserting that she has no connections with anyone beyond her family and close friends who voluntarily ceased supporting the organisation.\n\nThe Belgian emphasised that she is merely one of the sponsors of Tabasamu School, not an owner as alleged and that the school's owners have been compliant with the Ministry of Education since 2023, a fact known to county education officials.\n\n“Tabasamu School sponsors and volunteers have no links to the children’s home, and if any sponsor withdrew from it (the children’s home), then that was of their own volition. I neither opened the school nor received royalties using the children's photographs. The applicants' allegation is unfounded,” she said.\n\nShe described the allegations against her as malicious. She pointed out that she shared on social media photos of her regular visits to the organisation when she was still its sponsor or volunteer.\n\nShe clarified that she registered Tabasamu VZW, a charitable organisation in Belgium, in September 2022 and that none of its board members have links to the children's home.\n\n\"Tabasamu VZW is not a school but a Belgian charitable organisation registered to raise funds for needy children,\" she said.\n\nThe complainants also sued the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Officer Commanding Diani Police Station.\n\nThe two complainants also want the police ordered to commence investigations into the operations of Tabasamu School and tender its findings in court.\n\nIllegal operations\n\nThey also want the ODPP granted 30 days' leave to make its recommendations into the alleged crimes and illegal operations in the school.\n\nBesides this, the complainants want Ms Bruyn and the school compelled to take down the images of the children under the care of Kebene Children's Home and Group & Rotaract Global from their school website, social media pages and or any other form of digital and or print media pending inter-partes hearing and final disposition of the case.\n\n“Ms Bruyn is not entitled to royalties in the photograph, as she does not have the copyright to use the images, and more so using images of Kenyan children in foreign countries in a bid to solicit funds for self-enrichment,” they said.\n\nThey have also alleged that the Belgian has gone ahead and posted many untruths and lies about them to undermine their name through her Facebook page and other channels, causing emotional damage to the children hosted in the Children’s home premises.\n\nAlso, they allege that Ms Bruyn has reached out to their sponsors and or donors via social media and damaged their name, causing them to lose many donors.\n\nThey claim to have suffered loss and damages in terms of finances as investors say to have already sponsored the school through the government, while the school is not a member of the Kebene Children's Home and Group & Rotaract Global.\n\n“Her conduct is unlawful and constitutes unjust enrichment of herself and unlawful interference with our children's economic interest.

{"title": "Jilted lover to serve 30 years in jail for splashing acid in woman’s eyes", "content": "A 30-year-old man, who splashed acid on his girlfriend's face after she rejected him following a short courtship, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\nMohamed Mwarandu Kombe will now serve three decades behind bars for his inability to cope with the fact that Ms Fatuma Kaingu no longer wanted to be with him.\n\nMombasa Senior Resident Magistrate, Gladys Olimo, sentenced the spurned lover, noting that his actions had permanently deprived Ms Kaingu, 23, of her eyesight.\n\nRead: Identity of woman found dead alongside Eastleigh robbers revealed\n\n“It is quite unfortunate that Ms Kaingu will never enjoy the sense of vision which is one of the most important senses. For the rest of her life, she will not enjoy everyday activities like hobbies. She shall no longer see the beauty of the world,” said the magistrate.\n\nIn her ruling, the magistrate noted that it was regrettable that Kombe’s cruelty and inhumane act completely altered the woman’s life.\n\n“It is against this backdrop that this court is in agreement with the state that a deterrent sentence is necessary in the circumstance of this case. Consequently, Kombe is sentenced to serve 30 years imprisonment. Right of appeal is 14 days,” said Ms Olimo.\n\nRead: In the name of love: Mombasa woman charged with defrauding disabled man of Sh2.7 million\n\nWhile jailing the man, the magistrate noted that she had considered the prosecution’s submission and the accused mitigation that he was a family man and first offender, with no previous criminal record.\n\n“I know Kombe has a young family. However, it is of interest to know the aggravating circumstances obtained in this case. The complainant completely lost her eyesight as a result of the accused actions,” said the magistrate.\n\nThe court also observed that the complainant's testimony was adequately supported by medical evidence indicating that her conjunctiva was infected, red, swollen, and with a laceration on the upper lid.\n\nThese injuries were classified as grievous bodily harm.\n\n“Given that the conjunctiva was infected, red, and swollen, and the complainant's testimony that she has completely lost her eyesight and the medical evidence, it is sufficient proof that the injuries sustained endangered her life and extended to permanent disfigurement,” said the magistrate.\n\nKombe was charged with two offences of grievous harm and malicious property damage.\n\nThe court heard that Kombe sprinkled acid on the victim’s face causing her permanent blindness.\n\nHe also damaged her mobile phone valued at Sh6,000. These offences were committed on November 15, 2021, in Tudor, Mombasa.\n\nMs Kaingu was at the time working as a house help in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe court heard that on the material day, Kombe followed her to the house and sprinkled the acid on her face.\n\n“Before the incident, the two were in a relationship, but Maingu had communicated to the accused person that she was not interested in the relationship anymore,” said the officer, while being cross-examined by state counsel Hillary Isiaho.\n\nRead: Mombasa: Police hold banker for allegedly stabbing lover\n\nKombe then became upset with the complainant’s move and decided to harm her as a way of revenge.\n\n“He splashed a chemical onto the victim’s face at night after he met her,” she told the court.\n\nHowever, Kombe denied the offenses, claiming he did not harm the victim.\n\nHe explained that he had purchased liquid soap, which he used to defend himself by splashing it on the victim's face.\n\n\"It was not acid, but liquid soap. The victim had attacked me with a stone, and I splashed the water on her in self-defence,\" he stated.\n\nKombe mentioned that the victim did not suffer any injuries when he left her because he had also used non-harmful liquid soap.\n\nHe acknowledged being with the victim on the day in question and trying to calm her down after their disagreement.\n\n\"The victim was unharmed when I departed. We had a dispute, but I did not harm her,\" he clarified.\n\nNevertheless, the court rejected his defense, citing numerous contradictions.\n\n“Kombe’s defense consists of half-truths and twisted facts and mere afterthoughts. I find the offense of grievous harm has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. I do find him guilty as charged and accordingly convict him,” said the magistrate.\n\nMr Isiaho requested the court to impose a strict sentence that would serve as a deterrent, considering that the accused's actions deprived the victim of her bodily autonomy and light.\n\n“We urge that the accused receive a prison term that reflects the seriousness of the offense he has committed and the lasting impact it has had on the victim,” stated the prosecutor.\n\nOn the other hand, Kombe appealed for leniency, expressing concern for his young family that required his care.\n\n“I got married just last year, I have a young family with a child.  I implore the court to show me mercy,” he pleaded.\n\nDespite Kombe's plea for mercy and leniency, the court disregarded it, emphasizing that he must face a custodial sentence for the consequences of his actions.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nBrian Ocharo", "date": "Wednesday, May 08, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4617164/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/df044e9749dd58cdf0f1520f10a7178/XB/jiltedloveracid.jpg", "image_description": "Mohammed Mwarandu Kombe when he appeared before a Mombasa Court on May 8, 2024.

{"title": "Malaria's gendered burden: Recent floods heighten risk for women, girls", "content": "Amidst countrywide floods, medical experts foresee a surge in diseases like malaria, disproportionately affecting women and girls.\n\nDr Trizah Milugo, a medical entomologist renowned for her work in malaria treatment and prevention, warns that regions prone to malaria, such as Western Kenya and the Coast, may witness a spike in cases.\n\n\"When floods recede, stagnant pools of water provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes, leading to increased malaria transmission,\" she explains.\n\nDr Trizah elucidates on the gendered vulnerabilities to malaria, emphasising that while mosquitoes are impartial, the disease discriminates.\n\nShe first explains the mode of infection. “To contract malaria, one must be bitten by a mosquito carrying the parasite. The female mosquito's sole purpose is to feed on blood for nourishment, without any gender bias involved.”\n\nHowever, women and girls, she notes, are at heightened risk due to societal roles and behaviours that expose them more to mosquito bites.\n\n\"Women's daily routines coincide with peak mosquito activity, from early morning breakfast preparations to outdoor cooking. For instance, they wake up early to prepare breakfast while their families are still asleep, exposing themselves to mosquitoes.\n\n\"Additionally, traditional cooking methods, often conducted outdoors, further increase their exposure to mosquito bites compared to men,\" she highlights.\n\nHer sentiments are corroborated by a study on ‘Gender difference in the incidence of malaria diagnosed at public health facilities in Uganda’ published by Malaria Journal that found that women were more affected by Malaria compared to men.\n\nDr Trizah also underscores the gender disparities in seeking medical care, particularly affecting women and children in remote areas.\n\n“Typically, women assume the role of caretakers for the sick, while men often do not. In some remote cultures, even seeking medical treatment for women and children necessitates permission from men, who are usually the primary breadwinners.\n\n\"This often leads to financial constraints preventing women from accessing clinics, unlike men who can easily walk to one when they're unwell.”\n\nFirst-time pregnant women, she stresses, face heightened vulnerability as they lack the acquired immunity that repeated exposure affords. Untreated malaria during pregnancy can lead to severe complications, including maternal and foetal mortality.\n\n“If they contract malaria and do not receive immediate treatment, it can lead to severe complications such as anaemia, low birth weight, premature delivery, or even maternal and foetal death.”\n\nIn 2019, WHO estimated that Africa accounted for 94 per cent of the world’s 229 million cases of Malaria. In Kenya, 70 per cent of the population are at risk of malaria and close to 3.5 million new cases are reported each year.\n\nTherefore, as part of a gender-sensitive disaster response, Dr Trizah advocates pregnant women to prioritise sleeping under mosquito nets.\n\nShe emphasises the necessity for proactive measures, including the distribution of nets and administration of preventive medication, to mitigate the impact of malaria outbreaks in vulnerable regions.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nAgatha Gichana", "date": "Tuesday, May 14, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4604272/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/92104d51bbf8e64176f9b2a6199d2ae9/Wk/floods-pic.jpg", "image_description": "A woman in Laza Mwembeni village in Tana River County leads her children to safety as the River Tana swells up. Natural disasters like floods disproportionately affect women and children, exacerbating existing gender inequalities. \nPhoto credit: Stephen Oduor | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-14T03:00:00Z"}
{"title": "Geologists investigate huge cracks and earth movements in Nakuru", "content": "The government has deployed senior geologists to Nakuru for more detailed studies after massive earth movements left deep fissures in different parts of the county.\n\nDeep ditches have formed in the Kiambogo area after heavy rains, causing tension in the surrounding villages. Kaptembwo, Ngata and London areas also recently experienced huge cracks and fissures cutting across people’s farms and estates.\n\nIn Kaptembwo, the fissures damaged houses while tenants were inside last week while in Kiambogo, farms were left with huge cracks.\nPhoto credit: Boniface Mwangi| Nation\n\nThese spots are just one of the many weak spots in the Great Rift Valley which runs from the Horn of Africa to Mozambique.\n\nIn Kaptembwo, the fissures damaged houses while tenants were inside last week while in Kiambogo, farms were left with huge cracks.\n\nMining Principal Secretary Elijah Mwangi said a warning advisory has been shared with locals living in the affected areas.\n\nMr Mwangi explained that geologically, Nakuru County is located in an area prone to various geohazard types including sinkholes, landslides and earthquakes.\n\nThis means the county lies in an area where geological processes are most active\n\n“The western part with its complex network of underground drainage channels draining through porous unconsolidated pumice and volcanic ash is most prone to such hazards. These drainage channels create significant susceptibilities on the structural integrity of the land by forming subterranean tunnels and cavities which ultimately result in the creation of sinkholes that damage property and roads,” the PS said.\n\nNakuru County is located in an area prone to various geohazard types including sinkholes, landslides and earthquakes.\nPhoto credit: Boniface Mwangi| Nation\n\nHe said the county has had reports of sinkholes in the past.\n\nA sinkhole was reported in 1972 and 1981 at Roundabout near O’Jais Petrol Station.\n\nAfter the El Nino rainfalls of 1997, sinkholes appeared in London Estate.\n\nIn 2004, a similar incident occurred at TimSales Compound and Timber Mill Road.\n\nAreas with weakness along the rift valley have been forming fault lines and fissures which are normally filled with volcanic ash.\n\nBut the recent rains have aggravated the situation by washing away that volcanic ash, exposing the cracks.\n\nA cracked house in Nakuru's Kaptembwo Estate after fissures formed on the week of May 10, 2024. \nPhoto credit: Boniface Mwangi| Nation\n\n“Currently, twin sinkholes have been reported in the Manyani area in Nakuru County. Preliminary geo-hazard analysis indicates the sinkholes could have been caused by excessive water whose natural flow along the surface was impeded by poor drainage. The water percolated into the porous volcanic ash and joined the pre-existing underground drainage channels resulting in the hollowing-in of the earth's surface.\n\n“As department’s geo-physicists continue to enhance surveillance on other geological vulnerabilities that might occur, immediate intervention to avoid accumulation of excess water on the surface calls for construction of adequate storm drains and waterways within the town and residential areas to allow free and fast flowing of water to destination water bodies,” Mr Mwangi said.\n\nNakuru residents in high-risk areas have also been asked to report any sign of earth disturbance.\n\nIn 2018, a section of the busy Mai-Mahiu-Narok road near Suswa was split into two after heavy rains. Suswa lies at the bottom of the Rift Valley.\n\nPlate tectonics, or shifting of the earth’s crust is based on the argument that the earth’s outer shell is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle which is the inner layer above the core.\n\n[email protected]\n\n​\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nJoseph Openda", "date": "Tuesday, May 14, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4622534/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/bb918cc22204b6685e92c9170455b10b/mX/fissures1.jpg", "image_description": "Damaged houses in Nakuru's Kaptembwo Estate after fissures formed last week.\nPhoto credit: Boniface Mwangi| Nation", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-14T09:27:28Z"}

{"title": "Too poor for menses; period!", "content": "Anyone who menstruates requires proper access to menstrual materials, safe and hygienic facilities and the right to manage it without shame or stigma. Unfortunately, some women and adolescent girls live in period poverty.\n\nResearch shows that more than 800 million women menstruate daily and majority can’t manage their menses in a dignified and healthy way.\n\nAmerican Medical Women's Association defines period poverty as inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, including, but not limited to sanitary products, washing facilities and waste management.\n\nPeriod poverty is an underlying issue that contributes to the persistent high numbers of teenage pregnancies.\n\nStudies have also shown that absence of an environment supportive of the girls’ menstrual hygiene management (MHM) hinders them from attending school.\n\nOf the 250 girls interviewed in a study – Menstrual Hygiene Management and School Absenteeism among Adolescents in Ghana: Results from a School-Based Cross-Sectional Study in a Rural Community by Shamsudeen Mohammed et al., 60.4 per cent said lack of a private place to manage periods at school kept them off.\n\nA majority (82.2 per cent) missed school due to menstrual pain, found the study whose findings were published last year in the International Journal of Reproductive Medicine.\n\nAnother 70.3 per cent were deterred by the fear of staining and being teased, while 63.4 per cent stayed away due to non-availability of pads.\n\nAnother study Menstrual hygiene management in rural schools of Zambia; a descriptive study of knowledge, experiences and challenges faced by schoolgirls by Joyce Chinyama et al. attests to similar challenges.\n\nGirls in six rural schools in Zambia were interviewed.\n\nThey said inadequate provision of sanitary materials, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools forced them to stay at home during menstruation.\n\nIsolating themselves\n\n“Boys said they could tell when girls were menstruating by their smell and behaviour, for instance, moving less and isolating themselves from their peers,” the researchers state in study published in 2019, in BMC Public Health.\n\n“Girls complained of friction burns on their inner thighs during their long journey to school due to chaffing of wet non-absorbent material used to make menstrual cloth,” it further reads.\n\nThe findings are a reflection of Kenya’s situation. It refers to a previous study in Kenya that established that “Poor WASH facilities deter girls from using the facilities at school, with most girls opting to stay home until they finish menstruating.”\n\nOn average, girls begin puberty at 10 or 11 years depending on factors such as nutrition, guides Unesco in its 2014 document Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management.\n\nIn Kenya, Unesco estimates that some 2.6 million girls in school need support to obtain menstrual hygiene products. Further, approximately 300,000 of girls in arid and semi-arid regions would require both sanitary towels and underwear at an estimated cost of Sh2.6 billion.\n\nIn 2012/13 financial year, Sh300 million was set aside for the Ministry of Education to provide the sanitary towels. This amount was reduced to Sh30 million in 2013/14 financial year.\n\nUntil 2017, the ministry provided an estimated 568,925 underprivileged girls in public primary schools in 82 districts (now sub-counties) within marginalised and slum areas.\n\nThe coming into effect of Basic Education (Amendment) Act in June 2017 guaranteed all girls in puberty age enrolled in public primary and secondary schools, free provision of pads. In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was allocated Sh470 million. This catered for 14, 813, 810 packets distributed to 3.7 million girls during the fiscal year.  A sum of Sh420, 618,057 was spent.\n\nPrivate schools\n\nThere are 9.2 million girls enrolled in primary schools and 4.3 million others in secondary schools, confirms data from 2019 Census.\n\nAlthough data on girls in private schools is elusive, the current data could suggest that 72 per cent of the targeted girls have not benefited from the State sponsored programme.\n\nIn May last year, the Ministry of Health launched Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030) with one of the five targets being commitment to ensure WASH facilities are provided in all households, learning institutions, public places, healthcare facilities, workplaces and correctional facilities.\n\n“Without (access to menstrual hygiene materials, latrines and places to change, safe water and sanitation, and good hygiene practices like hand washing with soap), the school environment is unhealthy, gender discriminatory and inadequate,” states Unesco in its aforementioned publication.\n\nMinistry of Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha announced mid-January the purchase of Sh470 million worth sanitary towels for an unspecified number of girls in public schools across the country.\n\nHe said the distribution would begin in the third week of January with each of the benefiting girls receiving a one-off bundle lasting them nine months.\n\n“Each girl will get a collection of (pads for) nine months at once,” he said at Kahundira Primary School in Kiambu County.\n\nIt’s, however, unlikely that the girls will receive pads covering the nine-months with the financial allocation.\n\nWith the Sh470 million, at least 3.7 million girls will get four packets of the pads out of the 4.2 million needy cases. This will last four months.\n\nIn 2019, the then Public Service and Gender Affairs Principal Secretary Ms Safina Kwekwe revealed challenges bedevilling the programme.\n\n“When we started distributing the sanitary pads in the 2017/18 financial year, we gave them out to 3.7 million girls. We spent Sh460 million. We only gave four packs to girls in public primary, secondary and special schools. We had nothing for girls in vocational training and other institutions,” Ms Kwekwe is quoted in a local newspaper article dated September 14, 2019.\n\nShe added: “We have been having challenges because the money is not adequate. We need to have more so that girls can remain in school throughout but we have only been able to give them four months’ supply in the past.”\n\nWith the new law accompanied with the Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030), it meant, the government sat at the centre of meeting the menstrual hygiene management needs of girls in public facilities.\n\nIn 2017/18 financial year, the programme was moved to the Ministry of Public and Gender Affairs only for it to be moved back to the Education ministry, late 2019 following hiccups in tendering and distribution.\n\nFrom Tana River to Busia, menses remain a taboo topic burying girls in shame\n\nIn May last year, we shared a story on the challenges women in Tana River County face during their menses.\n\nFortunately, period poverty is fast becoming a thing of the past after we covered the story on menstrual hygiene challenges where women dug holes to sit on for hours during their menses.\n\nThe story that shocked the world, saw donors from as far as Turkey, Britain and the US march into the county to triumph over the shame of the 21st Century, marking the genesis of a revolution that is fast reinstating comfort to lives of the women and girls in the region.\n\nMenstrual hygiene ambassadors and menstrual cops moved into villages donating countless sanitary towels.\n\n“In the past, we could not even talk about our private parts, sanitary pads were not a language we spoke. We only did what our mothers taught us,\" says Salima Waqo, a mother of three.\n\nMs Waqo is one of the women who taught her children the traditional way of menstrual hygiene since that is what she knew.\n\nAccording to her, she learnt about sanitary towels in June after activists started making door to door visits to teach on menstrual hygiene.\n\n\"Even my children knew about sanitary towels, but they never shared with me, they were embarrassed to do so,\" she says.\n\nLeila Nuru, an activist and a menstrual cop notes that most women from pastoral communities are not schooled on sanitary towels, and rely on traditional methods, where rags are used or holes are dug in the worst circumstances.\n\nA woman watches as her daughter digs a hole for her menses in the bush in Makutano village, Tana River County.\nPhoto credit: Stephen Oduor | Nation Media Group\n\nThe activist notes that even shops in the remote areas never stock sanitary towels.\n\n\"Women in our community are very shy, if they have to buy sanitary towels from a shop, the attendant has to be a woman, or they will send a child,\" she says.\n\nMs Nuru has started training men from pastoralists’ communities on understanding menstrual hygiene and how to support their children and women through the process.\n\nAccording to her, in the community where men are the providers, only knowledge is required to sustain the solutions currently being implemented.\n\nHowever, poverty remains the community's biggest challenge. As a result, the women have appealed to the national government and relative organisations to equip them with re-usable sanitary towels.\n\nThey say that unlike the disposable ones, re-usable towels are sustainable, cost, and environmental-friendly.\n\nAccording to Muslima Godana, an activist, a lot of the disposable sanitary towels have ended up in water reservoirs and the streets, hence detrimental to both the environment and human health.\n\n\"The disposable towels need to be done away with as we adopt an alternative solution,\" she says.\n\nEfforts to eradicate menstrual disparity in the county are encouraging, with the county government allocating Sh2 million to support menstrual hygiene.\n\nKenya Works Organisation among other organisations, distributes re-usable sanitary towels targeting 5,000 girls and women in pastoral communities for free.\n\nIn Busia County, many adolescent girls faced with challenges of accessing menstrual hygiene management products admit to having transactional sex for pads.\n\nMs Mary Makokha, the Director of Rural Education and Economic Enhancement Programme (Reep) says some parents only provide food for their families and ask the girls to look for other basic needs on their own.\n\n“This is happening because of poverty – girls and some women don’t have the financial means to buy sanitary products,” says Ms Makokha, noting that men also take advantage of desperate students, sexually exploiting them before offering money for their basic needs.\n\nThe girls accept as low as Sh50 to buy sanitary towels.\n\n“Girls are exposed to boda boda riders, truck drivers, shamba boys and even weird grown up men in the villages,” Ms Makokha adds.\n\nThe poverty rate pushes some of the girls to either engage in prostitution or marry young to ease the financial burden on their families.\n\nMs Florence Opetu* (not her real name), a Form Three student at Murende Mixed Secondary School says she engaged in the business when she could not afford pads.\n\n“One day, I was having my periods but did not have pads; when I stood up, my clothes were stained. The whole class started laughing,” she says.\n\nThis really embarrassed her.\n\n“One day while heading home from school, a boda boda rider offered me a lift. I resisted hesitantly but after he persuaded me and assured that it was a mere lift, I accepted,” she adds.\n\nThe school girl says she ended up getting into a relationship with the man in his mid-30s.\n\nPeriod poverty is a widespread problem in the country – and those who cannot afford sanitary pads use old cloths, pieces of blankets and newspapers.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, girls who got free sanitary products at school were pushed to desperate measures and scores became pregnant as they looked for money for pads.\n\nThe government failed to extend the services to their homes when schools closed on March 15, 2020, leaving the girls at the mercy of the society.\n\nMeanwhile in Kilifi County, stakeholders and organisations have been in the frontline to boost the National government’s initiative, through the Woman Representative’s office, to provide sanitary towels to school girls.\n\nThis is an indication that the sanitary pads being distributed by National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) do not meet the demands in schools.\n\nThe Filipino winning souls while ensuring they enjoy every moment of life\n\nAs you drive towards South Kinangop, off the Naivasha-Nairobi highway, there is an imposing house on the hill overlooking Lake Naivasha.\n\nThe house owner is a Filipino woman who came to Kenya in 1998. Ms Minalyn Nicklin, 56, is a missionary with a big vision and mission; to help poor girls and women in Naivasha and its environs enjoy safe menstrual hygiene management (MHM).\n\nMs Minalyn Nicklin displays some of the reusable sanitary pads she makes at her house in Naivasha town. \nPhoto credit: Francis Mureithi | Nation Media Group\n\nShe makes reusable sanitary pads that are environmentally friendly, accessible and affordable, in a section of her house, which she has converted into a workshop.\n\nDisposable sanitary pads are prohibitively expensive for girls and women in Naivasha rural villages. This means that during menstruation, they use old clothes which often leak, staining their dresses and are uncomfortable.\n\nMs Nicklin wants this to change. \"I believe every journey in a positive direction starts with a single step. Making sanitary pads that are easy to use, inexpensive, and recyclable could be a big help for women.\"\n\nHer husband, Mr Peter Nicklin who is a medical doctor and her step son Alistair support her venture.\n\nShe says limited access to clean water, proper sanitation facilities and sanitary pads make it difficult for girls and women to manage their menstruation hygienically.\n\nAs a result, many young women face considerable physical and social challenges during menstruation, including missing school and missing out on important economic activities.\n\nMs Nicklin’s venture has support from local partners and individual volunteers from the US.\n\nHer pads are made of cotton with the inside layer made from a nylon-type fabric. They are washable after use enabling users to save money because of a longer utility.\n\nWomen and girls who use them say they are comfortable and leak-free.\n\n\"I have no fears moving and doing my house chores,\" says Ms Jemimah Musimbi, a beneficiary.\n\nMs Nicklin says the objective of her missionary work in the country is not just to win souls alone but also make sure the souls enjoy every moment of their lives.\n\n“I have discovered that many poor women and girls in the surrounding villages use old rags, and other unhygienic substances like leaves as pad during menstruation,\" says the mother of two.\n\nThis, she says, could lead to reproductive diseases and affect maternal mortality.\n\n\"My mission is not just to increase the accessibility and use of clean sanitary pads, but also create job opportunities for rural women,\" she explains.\n\nShe has invested in five sewing machines and employed three workers.\n\n‘Period man’ seeking to change men’s mindsets towards menses\n\nHe calls himself Period Man! A year ago, 28-year-old Mr James Atito was teaching girls at Kakuma village in Turkana County how to use pads, maintain cleanliness during the menses and manage pain among other things.\n\nHe had been contracted to undertake the sensitisation. Then one of the girls stood up and asked him: \"Why do you talk about periods? Are you period man?\" That passed as one of those curious queries. The session ended. Evening came.\n\nAs he took a walk around the village in the evening, he noticed a group of seven girls sitting along the paths on the rills. Some sat on the bare soil. Some on animal skins.\n\n\"I wondered why the girls were sitting there late in the evening when they should be at home,\" he starts off the conversation.\n\nMr James Atito is a male advocate in the fight towards ending period poverty.\nPhoto credit: Kevin Odit | Nation Media Group\n\n\"I was shocked to be told that they were on periods and that they were forbidden from their homesteads until their periods were over. That was an unimaginable stigma. I felt so sad for them and it got me thinking. I said I must do something to end the stigma.\"\n\nHis journey back to Mombasa, where he is based, was filled with thought of what he can do different to emancipate women and girls from period shame and discrimination.\n\nAfter two months of researching through reading publications on periods and web scraping, Mr Atito found a missing voice in ending period poverty – that of men.\n\n\"Often men are barriers to women's access and use of family planning. And we tell men to be engaged in family planning but we don't tell them how. It's the case with how girls access and use sanitary towels,\" he says.\n\nTo reach men and use himself as an example of a male advocate in the fight towards ending period poverty, he settled for Period Man, an identity that equally identifies with the girl who sought to find out whether he has the monthly experiences of menses.\n\nSo who is the Period Man? This is the brand name behind Mr Atito that he copyrighted through formal registration with Kenya Copyright Board.\n\nFor the past one year, Mr Atito has run two campaigns on Facebook and Twitter,\n\n#Men4Periods365 and #Men4PeriodsMovement, meant to raise men's consciousness on their role in ending period poverty.\n\nHe for instance shares information on period pain and its management, how to make reusable pads - a skill he learnt through apprentice - and maintain menstrual hygiene.\n\n\"Men perpetrate period shame and discrimination. My mission is to reach them at the household level and find sustainable solutions. Once we have solutions, we will no longer need to push the government or partners to provide girls with the pads,\" he reckons.\n\nMr Atito studied finance and accounting.\n\nPeriod of shame that birthed Janet’s book My First Time\n\n“It was a shocking, frustrating and sad. How is it that we are in 2013 and the girls are using chicken feathers and goats hides?” This is Ms Janet Mbugua’s reflection of a feature on period poverty titled “Period of Shame.”\n\nMs Janet Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, launched in 2014, to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls. \nPhoto credit: Dennis Onsongo | Nation Media Group\n\nIt was aired on a local TV station in 2013. It featured girls from Marigat in Baringo County who demonstrated how they fitted the non-absorbent goat hides or stuffed chicken feathers in their underwear. They pluck the feathers from a live or slaughtered chicken. While unmarried girls are allowed to borrow the goat hides from their married peers, a harmful practice that exposes them to infections.\n\nOne of the girls interviewed said: “It is very uncomfortable. It pricks you. During examination, I write while standing,” added the girl then in Class Seven.\n\nAt the time, 90 per cent of the allocation to the sanitary towels programme had been slashed.\n\nMs Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, born out of the pain and shock she felt when she watched the feature. Since its launch in 2014, Ms Mbugua has used it as the voice to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls.\n\n‘Period of Shame’ was the topic of discussion in her subsequent talk shows. For days, the discussion trended on Twitter.\n\n“People were outraged to the point they were leaving pads for those girls outside our gates of the TV station,” she shares. “And it triggered me, so I asked my boss ‘Can we do something? I don’t feel okay with this just dying as it is. She agreed and I came up with Inua Dada Initiative.”\n\nThe initiative, she says, was aimed at pushing the government to allocate the programme more money alongside mobilising resources to buy pads for the girls.\n\nLater, they delivered pads and underwear to about 10,000 girls in Baringo County. Nevertheless, she was not happy about the one-off donation.\n\nThe need for a sustainable means to end girls’ inaccessibility to the menstrual products, proper sanitation facilities and information, nagged her. And this is how she ended up registering her foundation in 2014. And later in 2017, opting out of the media.\n\nIn 2018, she started compiling content for her book My First Time. The book that launched in February last year, profiles menstruation experiences of 50 girls including those with disability and HIV.\n\nWith the book, she purposes, breaking the silence on period poverty and ending the stigma, attached to it. She also features men’s voices.\n\n“Men cannot be ignored in the conversation. They are our biggest allies,” she says.\n\nHer book is bringing changes to how men perceive the subject.\n\n“I’d go to places and fathers could come up to me and say ‘Your book helped me figure out, how to break down this conversation at home with my sons and daughters,” she says.\n\nMs Mbugua is extending the book to add an addendum on the Pan-African perspective on emerging period poverty issues during the Covid-19 period. The new version will be out in two months.\n\nShe says: “Period poverty was blown wide open during Covid-19. Suddenly, schools that were giving pads were closed. Suddenly, the women who were washing clothes to earn a keep had lost their jobs. A lot of girls turned to sex for pads, more than we know.”\n\nShe is happy her relentless efforts on social media have resulted in more people engaging in the subject, wrapped as a taboo.\n\n“I posted a picture of my stained pyjamas…there were 10,000 likes and about 1,000 comments. It tells you people want to talk,” she says.\n\n“A few people in the comment section are saying ‘Thank you for just opening this door for us to comment on an issue that is so often a taboo.’…and for me that is a win.”\n\nIn the midst of the pandemic, Ms Mbugua has maintained the momentum through virtual activities.\n\nLast year, she held a virtual period party where women highlighted the prevailing challenges and advocated for action from the government. She has earned herself a special friend for her consistent campaign against period poverty; public criticism.\n\nLate last year, her foundation embarked on a sustainable approach of ending period poverty. It entered into partnership with The Pad Project to run a two-pronged pad project in Nairobi County.\n\nReport by Moraa Obiria, Francis Mureithi, Stephen Oduor, Shaban Makokha and Maureen Ongala.\n\n[email protected],  [email protected],  [email protected], [email protected], [email protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nGender desk team", "date": "Monday, February 08, 2021", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3283466/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/3139b09d8441fb56064a172ff3b543de/Lp/cover.jpg", "image_description": "Some of the pupils of Kinango Primary School in Kwale County where more than 150 girls out of 328 cannot afford sanitary towels.

{"title": "Homa Bay teacher speared to death, his motorbike stolen", "content": "Police in Rangwe in Homa Bay County are investigating an incident in which a secondary school teacher was killed by unknown individuals as he was riding his motorcycle on Friday night.\n\nThe teacher identified as Benson Evans was killed in Komenya Sub-location in East Kochia Location after leaving Bakhita Girls Secondary School where he taught Mathematics and Chemistry.\n\nHis attackers killed him with a spear which hit the back of his head before the assailants took off with his motorcycle.\n\nThe spear got lodged in his head with part of the weapon penetrating through to his mouth.\n\nEvans died on Saturday morning upon arrival at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu.\n\nInvestigators have established that the teacher was spotted within the school compound until a few minutes to 7pm when he left.\n\nAt the school's entrance he is reported to have met two of his colleagues who live at a place known as Omoya Trading centre along Olare-Imbo road.\n\nBeing that he had a motorcycle, he decided to ferry the two teachers home.Komenya Sub-location Assistant Chief Lilian Ombayi said the deceased decided to visit one of his colleagues.\n\n“He stayed at his colleague’s house until 8:30 pm when he left for his house located in Rodi Kopany,” the administrator said.\n\nSomewhere along the way he was confronted by a group of unidentified people before he got to the main road.\n\nResidents reported hearing some commotion before the teacher cried out for help.One of his colleagues said Evans was staggering towards them and since it was stark dark they could not immediately identify him.\n\n“He was walking back to the house where he was earlier with difficulty. We thought he was drunk because he was speaking incoherently,” one of the teachers said.\n\nBy this time, the neighbours had not noticed that he had been speared.\n\n“It is after he fell down that we saw a spear lodged behind his head. His motorcycle was also missing,” the colleagues said.\n\nThe injured teacher was first rushed to a private hospital in Kochia.\n\nDoctors there however said they could not help him and referred the tutor to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital.\n\nMedics at the referral hospital tried stabilizing him before recommending that he be transferred to Kisumu.\n\nAll along, he had the spear stuck on his head.\n\n“He died upon arrival at the hospital in Kisumu,” Ms Ombayi said.\n\nHis body was later transferred to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting post mortem.\n\nTeachers in Homa Bay under their umbrella body, Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) asked police to ensure whoever is responsible for the murder is apprehended and prosecuted.\n\nCounty Kuppet Chairman Jack Okoth appealed to police to speed up investigations into the incident and ensure that justice prevails.\n\n“We want to know who killed our colleague and the reasons for the murder. Justice must be served to the family of Evans,” the unionist said.\n\nRangwe Sub-county Police Commander Magdaline Chebet said investigations into the incident have been launched.\n\nShe said her officers are following crucial leads that will enable them to apprehend the suspects.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nGeorge Odiwuor", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4584086/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/a298f7ca1006337348e093863f66b934/zI/crime-scene.jpg", "image_description": "A police tape at a crime scene.\nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-19T11:55:25Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "In 1996, a respected elder living in Dabel, Marsabit County, prophesied that precious minerals would be discovered in the area. But just how big a blessing and later, a curse it was to become, was not clear to any of the dismissive residents he told.\n\nWhile the old man died a few months later in 1996, the prophecy came to pass in 2018 when a herder found gold nuggets and sold them, kicking off a mad gold rush in the village located 64 kilometres west of Moyale town at the Kenya-Ethiopia border.\n\n“We vividly remember how one of our elders and a seer prophesied about gold discovery, but we did not take him seriously at the time. After the discovery, we expected to reap big from it,” says Sakuye community secretary Hajj Hassan Tepo.\n\nBut the discovery of the precious mineral turned into a curse.\n\nIn March this year, eleven people—all said to be Ethiopians—were killed in a clash over how to share the resources. This was after members of two warring communities stumbled on huge deposits inside the mines and failed to agree on how to share them.\n\nRead: Experts want laws to control mining deals\n\nSakuye community vice secretary Mohammed Ali Wario detailed how two rival groups of miners dug tunnels and bumped into each other and began a scrambling for gold that exploded into ethnic conflict.\n\nFight erupted\n\n“They were digging from the opposite sides and met where the deposits were. When they disagreed and fought inside the mine, a vicious fight erupted among members of their communities outside,” said Mr Wario.\n\nThe government, through a Gazette notice published by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on March 13, shut down the 13 mines spread over an area of about 50 square kilometres and deployed the military to guard the area.\n\nThe mining sites are Hillo Gorgora, Hillo Orofa, Hillo Walkite, Hillo Tanzania, Hillo Irress Abamartille, Hillo Gootu, Hillo Tessum Qalicha, Hillo Karray, Hillo Hudda, Hillo QQoranjido, Shindia, Hillo Rabaalee, and Hillo Godde Haroressa.\n\nBefore the indefinite closure of the fields, miners reportedly reaped millions of shillings. There was a massive influx of miners and investors from other parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia. Dabel became a sort of shanty town teeming with more than 70,000 people drawn from several countries.\n\nAccording to the miners we interviewed in Moyale, a lot of gold was mined each month.\n\n“Gold mining is a highly secretive business and nobody would disclose how much they made. But going by the kind of business that was going on in Moyale town and the tycoons who drove all the way from Nairobi, traders raked in millions of shillings a day,” said Mr Abubakar Hassan, a resident.\n\nAfter the closure, the miners said, their lives have been turned upside down with equipment and ore valued at over Sh500 million lying at the sites. They complained that they were not allowed to access or service their machines amid claims some people were still being allowed into the mines and cart away ore.\n\n100 investors\n\nMr Wote Gayo, who moved into the mines in July last year and employed about 50 people, said he owned a crasher that was still at the site, and was worried that the equipment was being used by other people.\n\nHe added that with more than 100 investors like him, they estimated the property held up at the site is worth over Sh500 million.\n\n“My crusher and other investments are worth more than Sh3 million and I am worried they are being misused. It is now two months since the mines were shut and we have not even been allowed to go and service our machines,” Mr Gayo said.\n\nRead: Police detain two found with Sh5.7m in Euros, gold bars\n\n“The warring communities have since resolved their differences and we want the government to reopen the mines, not only for a select few, but for all of us. This is because we fear continued closure could result in further conflict as people try to access the mines by force,” he added.\n\nMoyale Council of Elders Chairperson Shakur Ibrahim claimed that some rogue security officials colluded with businessmen to collect cart away ore and sold it secretly. He added that the ban should not only apply to the common man yet the rich continue to benefit.\n\n“We thank the government for moving with speed and closing the mines when the fight erupted. But at the moment, continued closure is not serving any purpose because the mines are open for the rich who are refining the ore in Moyale and exploiting our resources,” he said.\n\nHowever, Prof Kindiki reiterated that the mines would not be reopened, and hinted at extension of the closure notice.\n\n“We want all regulations put in place to ensure that there is adequate security so that when the mines are reopened, residents of the area benefit and not a few people. We shut the mines because they had been infiltrated by criminal elements,” Prof Kindiki said in Marsabit on May 10.\n\n\n\nEven as the mining activities contributed to impressive growth of businesses in Moyale town and lifted many jobless youths and women out of poverty, Mr Hajji Tepo said the local Sakuye community living close to the mines never benefited directly from this boom.\n\n\n\nHe said most of the revenues were smuggled through Ethiopia to Dubai and other Middle East countries and expressed concern that poverty rates and inequalities in the community were still alarmingly high despite the resources.\n\nMr Tepo called on the government to allow the mining to reach its full potential and ensure the local communities have a role in making decisions over the resources.\n\n“When the mines are reopened the sharing of royalties should adhere to the law, where the national government gets 70 per cent, county government 20 per cent and the local community 10 per cent,” he said.\n\nMarch conflict\n\nMr Wario said proper mechanisms should be put into place to avert a repeat of the March conflict. “The mines should be reopened only after instituting adequate measures to avert congestion, land degradation, use of cyanide and mercury by miners, and proper hygiene measures.”\n\nLast month, Mining Principal Secretary Elijah Mwangi said the government would formalise the sector, with artisanal miners required to register Saccos that will be licensed to carry out mining activities. Artisanal mining committees would be formed in each county to provide guidelines on the licensing procedures, he said.\n\nHilo Artisanal Miners Cooperative vice secretary Mukhtar Intalo explained that plans were in top gear to register a cooperative, saying they were ready to undertake regulated mining.\n\n“We are putting strategies in place by registering cooperatives that will ensure there is sanity in the mining sector in Dabel before we embark on pushing the State to reopen the mines,” Mr Intalo said, adding that the Sacco has already registered 3,500 members.\n\nMoyale Youths Association Chairman Bona Adan appealed to the government to reopen the mines to allow the over 70,000 people who have now been rendered jobless to find a source of income.\n\nMoyale Maendeleo ya Wanawake Chairperson Asna Hussein said that when the mining was going on, there were cases of gender-based violence, defilement, rape, and moral degradation. “Before the mines are reopened, these issues, including environmental degradation, should be considered and addressed,”” she said.\n\n[email protected]; [email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nGitonga Marete\n & \nJacob Walter", "date": "Saturday, May 18, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4626634/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/7d347a6c92dba815602807ae7806326b/mh/hilo-gold-mining-site.jpg", "image_description": "Miners at the Hilo gold mining site on May 23, 2023.The mines were closed by the government after 11 people were killed during a scramble for gold in March this year.

{"title": "Biden, Trump woo Haley voters, 2024 election's new prize", "content": "Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump are scrambling to win over supporters of Nikki Haley, a constituency that could be crucial to sending either man back to the White House.\n\nHaley dropped out of the Republican presidential nomination contest on Wednesday but did not endorse Trump and said it was now up to him to \"earn\" the support of voters who did not initially back him.\n\nAlmost 570,000 voters in three key battleground states - Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan - voted for Haley in the Republican nominating contest, a small but potentially significant group in races that have been decided by tiny margins in recent elections.\n\nHaley won 250,000 votes in North Carolina's primary, for example, a state that Trump won by less than 75,000 votes in 2020.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump quickly put out statements on Wednesday calling on Haley voters to join their team - although they used vastly different tactics.\n\nBiden commended Haley on \"speaking the truth\" about Trump, while Trump said he had \"trounced\" her in the Super Tuesday Republican contest.\n\n\"Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump added that he \"would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation,\" and described Biden as an enemy who is destroying the country.\n\nTrump has derided Haley throughout the campaign - including using sexist and racist language. And many of her voters have wondered if they still have a place in the Republican Party, which has coalesced around Trump, despite his repeated lies about having won the 2020 election against Biden, and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nStill, some experts say there's little precedent for Republicans like Haley's supporters to automatically come out for a Democrat in a general election.\n\n\"The next several months are going to be about the two candidates trying to convince people to come home to their regular party,\" said Hans Noel, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University.\n\n\"Right now, the numbers are really high for Haley voters to say 'I would never vote for Trump.' But almost certainly most of them will come around and either vote for Trump or they might not vote at all,\" he said, citing historical precedent.\n\nPolitical strategists believe a significant number of Haley voters were Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents who crossed over to vote in Republican primary contests, to try to deliver a blow to Trump.\n\nStill, a bevy of anti-Trump groups will be working hard to convince Haley voters to get behind Biden.\n\nReed Galen, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a prominent anti-Trump group of current and former Republicans, said Haley had shown that there are up to 30% of Republican voters who do not like Trump, a figure that would represent about 11 million registered Republicans nationwide.\n\nGalen said his group will target them between now and November's general election, aiming $50 million at an anti-Trump, pro-Biden persuasion campaign focused on battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.\n\nThe digital and TV ad campaign will focus on abortion rights, the blow to U.S. prestige abroad under Trump, and his failure to fully support Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\nPrimaryPivot, another pro-Haley group, changed its name to Haley Voters for Biden just after Haley dropped out of the race.\n\nCo-founder Robert Schwartz said the group will target the roughly 500,000 voters who backed Haley in the primary campaign in Michigan and North Carolina, as well as possible Haley voters in Georgia, which holds its primary March 12.\n\nRepublican strategist Ford O'Connell, who worked with Trump during the 2020 campaign, said he expected Trump to extend an \"olive branch\" to Haley supporters but that many were not persuadable.\n\nO'Connell noted that Trump did not go after Haley in his speech on Tuesday night. Trump showed that he \"understood that the way to victory is to stay on the issues: the border, prices, foreign policy,\" O'Connell said.\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Thursday, March 07, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/1926900/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/3dfa6c369cd82de56f9825e6b6c4aaa9/wA/biden-pic.jpg", "image_description": "US President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nPhoto credit: File", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-03-07T04:33:07Z"}

The programme has been allocated Sh4.9 billion in the current financial year.\n\nConditional grants\n\n“Kenya Kwanza government will double the amount of money allocated to the school feeding programme to immediately raise the number of beneficiaries from two million to four million and to provide conditional grants to county governments to extend the programme and raise the numbers to eight million in primary and Early Child Development (ECD) schools,” the manifesto reads.\n\nLast year, while speaking at the UN Food Systems Summit in Italy, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua claimed the Kenya school feeding programme had doubled school enrolment.\n\n“In Kenya, we’ve succeeded in having a very good and effective school feeding programme that has doubled school enrolment,” Mr Gachagua said.\n\nHowever, the Ministry of Education has now appealed to the National Assembly to reinstate the funding.\n\nRead: Lobby petitions court to stop Governor Sakaja's school feeding programme\n\n“It is worth noting that the School Feeding Programme was not funded.

No child misses school for lack of food unless they’re sick,” he said.\n\nMr Sakaja said that the programme has increased enrolment in Nairobi public primary schools by 24 per cent and that by the end of first term, it had 184,000 learners on board. This term, there are 200,000 learners following the opening of more kitchens.\n\nThe Education ministry has also seen reduction in allocations for Free Day Secondary Education (Sh1.5 billion), Free Primary Education (Sh1.2 billion) and Sh347 million under operations and maintenance.\n\nRequired funding\n\nAccording to the ministry, the required funding for FPE in the 2024/25 financial year is Sh9.781 billion and therefore the allocated budget has a shortfall of Sh660 million.\n\nThe FDSE shortfall is Sh12.8 billion. “If all learners are facilitated with capitation against the allocation of Sh63.9 billion in the proposed budget, then every learner will receive about Sh18,757 only,” reads the report. Each learner in a public secondary school is entitled to Sh22,244 per year.\n\n“On the other hand, if [all] learners are to receive full capitation of Sh22,244 as per the current policy, then 1,381,100 learners will not be funded in Term III of 2024 academic and 372,270 learners will not be funded in Terms I and II in 2025 academic year.”\n\nRead: Wonder porridge keeping learners in school\n\nSemi-autonomous government agencies (SAGAs) under the ministry have a cumulative decrease of Sh1.9 billion in the budget proposals.\n\n“It is imperative to note that four out of the nine SAGAs have zero allocation in the proposed draft estimates. These are Science Equipment Production Unit (SEPU), National Council for Nomadic Education in Kenya (NACONEK) and Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education in Africa (CEMASTEA),” reads the document.\n\nThe enrolment for learners with special needs in public primary schools is expected to be 56,553, translating to a capitation requirement of Sh622 million (at a rate of Sh11,000). However, in the budget estimates, the allocation has been omitted.\n\nRead: Feeding programme that is keeping learners in school\n\nThere is no allocation at all for learners with special needs in junior school although the ministry had put in a request for Sh453 million.\n\nThe enrolment for learners with special needs in public secondary schools is 21,999.

{"title": "Government allocates Sh500m to build 17 footbridges in Nairobi", "content": "The government has allocated Sh500 million for construction of 17 footbridges in Nairobi after the floods that devastated the city swept away or destroyed most of them.\n\nJustus Onyikwa, a deputy director at the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA), said the agency has prioritized Nairobi for rehabilitation.\n\nHowever, they are committed to addressing roadwork, particularly in areas where they were washed out, ensuring prompt attention and maintenance.\n\n“The estimated cost of completing the work on the 17 footbridges is around Sh500 million. Currently, their concentration is solely on Nairobi, before rolling out repair across the country. We will attend to all roads even as we try to secure extra funds to cover all the affected areas,” Mr Onyikwa told Sunday Nation.\n\nHe estimated the damage to bridges as exceeding 80 percent.\n\nRoads and Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen this week said the government needs between Sh25 billion and Sh30 billion to restore critical infrastructure destroyed by floods.\n\n“We are heavily impacted by the floods and have lost infrastructure, especially roads and bridges. From our assessment, we estimate that between Sh25 billion and Sh30 billion is needed for restoration,” said Murkomen.\n\nThe CS was speaking while assessing the state of the Gamba section of the Lamu-Witu-Garsen road that was swept away by floods on May, 15, 2024.\n\n“We need a lot of money to rehabilitate our roads and bridges,” he stressed adding that “an assessment of the damage is almost complete. We will talk to Parliament to set aside the necessary resources.”\n\nAccording to Mr Onyikwa, they will prioritise Mathare, Kamukunji, Kibra, Embakasi South, Kabete, Langata, and Westlands constituencies. These areas have been identified as high-priority due to their large populations and the urgent need for safe crossing points over oft-dangerous rivers.\n\n“We are concentrating on the densely populated regions. This includes the Jerusalem neighbourhood along the Nairobi River, which is heavily populated. Other key areas also require improved access to services considering majority of those affected are school children and commuters. The original bridges in these locations were washed away, so we are rebuilding them from the ground up,” he said.\n\nMr Onyikwa further said that they are reconstructing bridges spanning around 50 meters, aiming to enhance their clearance and bring them up to standard.\n\n“Initially, these bridges were [a basic] two rows, serving as small crossings at designated places. Now, we are improving and increasing their clearance while ensuring they meet required standards. Since the floods compromised the integrity of the bridges’ supports, we are building new bridges in some areas and elimination others, which were already in a state of disrepair,” he said.\n\nFootbridges being reconstructed are, Gitathuru-Wanjiru Footbridge, Mandera-Koria Footbridge, Lungalunga-Viwandani Footbridge, and Mosque Road Footbridge, Ngumba Bridge, Huruma (Ghetto area) Footbridge, and Madoya Bridge, which are vital connections within their respective communities.\n\nOthers ate the Gitathuru-Utalii Hotel Footbridge, Kisii Footbridge, and Kiambiu-Uhuru Bridge, Ruthimitu-Uthiru Bridge, Nyando Bridge, Sarang’ombe Footbridge, Sarang’ombe Motorable Bridge and of course, the Mumwe Road Box Culvert.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nMercy Simiyu", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3485652/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/b7f6f8358fc18d6896eca0570791d24d/hr/hawkers7.jpg", "image_description": "A section of the Muthaiga footbridge on Thika road in Nairobi.\nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-19T04:01:12Z"}

{"title": "What is my role as a male champion in SGBV fight?", "content": "Dear Vivian,\n\nI am a male champion and community-based paralegal. What is my role in sexual and gender-based violence in my community?\n\nMoses Onyiego,\n\nNyamira\n\nDear Moses,\n\nCommunity paralegals provide a bridge between the law and real life. They are sometimes called legal empowerment advocates, grassroots legal advocates, barefoot lawyers, male champions or community mobilisers. There is now an emergence of male champions, such as yourself, who are supporting the communities in gender issues.\n\nYour primary role is not to assist lawyers, but rather to work directly with the community you serve. Due to this role, seek continuous training in basic law and in skills like mediation, organising, education, and advocacy.\n\nFrom this backdrop, some of the roles you can engage in include promoting empowerment by developing SGBV awareness and available legal protections to the communities. You can also provide tailored solutions to legal problems through creative strategies and utilising a range of skills and tools, such as in-depth knowledge of local context. For example, you can help in addressing cultural harmful practices such as early child marriages, succession matters and female genital mutilation.\n\nAs portrayed above, you play a crucial role in the community because in most instances, you are the first point of contact with SGBV victims. Research shows that most of the victims find the legal process cumbersome, leading to fatigue or non-reporting. This is because lawyers are few, with most being located in urban centres, while the law and its procedures are complicated.  The victims, therefore, prefer having someone to walk with through the legal process.\n\nIt is crucial that you work within a network. I will recommend joining or forming a community of paralegals for effectiveness in ensuring access to justice is available to the indigent women. There are strategic places in the judicial system you can sit for example, the Court Users Committees (CUCs).\n\nThe Judicial Service Act institutionalises CUCs by providing for the establishment of the National Council on the Administration of Justice to ensure a coordinated, efficient, effective and consultative approach to the administration of justice and the transformation of the justice system.\n\nNotably, the CUC is a platform that brings together actors and users in the justice sector to enhance public participation, stakeholder engagement, develop public understanding of court operations and promote effective justice sector partnerships for a coordinated, efficient, effective and consultative approach in the administration of justice. One of the performance indicators of the CUCs is the increased number of people who go to court to seek services. This is where you would come in by ensuring that all SGBV cases within your community are reported.\n\nFinally, work closely with lawyers and counsellors to provide support to victims of SGBV. Remember you should not assist victims of SGBV to settle their cases out of court. In these cases, you are a bridge between the community and the formal justice institutions.\n\nVivian\n\nThe writer is an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and award-winning civil society lawyer ([email protected]).\n\n", "author": "By \nVivian Mwende", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/1936102/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/853b1cd6f7cfa8f7733289a5a6589624/Bv/fgm-male-champion-pic-2.jpg", "image_description": "Tony Mwebia is the founder of Men End FGM Foundation, an organisation that started off as an online campaign seven years ago, to fight FGM.\nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-15T07:00:00Z"}

{"title": "Damp pads, itchy discomfort: A slum girl's menstrual struggles in rainy season", "content": "Aaliyah*, a teenager born and raised in Mathare slum, Nairobi City County, was thrilled to receive three reusable cloth pads in February of this year. This came after she joined a vocational centre run by a charitable organisation within the slum.\n\nAt just 16 years, Aaliyah fell prey to an older man's false promises last year. He impregnated her, luring her with the prospect of providing for her needs, including money to purchase sanitary towels, in exchange for sexual favours.\n\nThe reusable cloth pads offered Aaliyah a newfound sense of dignity and autonomy, breaking the cycle of exploitation she had endured.\n\nAaliyah is among six siblings raised by her single mother who does unreliable jobs earning her as little as Sh50 at every chance.\n\nRead also: Laikipia group sustaining girls’ hygiene with free reusable pads\n\n“I was happy because I knew one of my problems had been eliminated (access to pads),” says Aaliyah who enrolled for a six-month cosmetology course at the centre, free of charge.\n\n“I have a child now and whatever I get goes into buying my daughter something she needs. My mom is already overwhelmed. I can't expect her to support me, or ask her for money to buy pads,” she says.\n\nBefore she got the reusable pads, most of the times, she would use pieces of old clothes to manage her menses. The recent heavy rains, however, challenged how she used the reusable pads.\n\n“During sunny days, if you wash the cloth pad at 8am, it's dry and ready to wear by 2pm. But when it rains, it takes two days or more, and it doesn't dry well. And I usually wear one during the day and another one during the night,” she says.\n\n“We have a charcoal iron box, so I’d put it in between clothes and press it to remove the water before I wear it.”\n\nDuring the time she used the damp pad, she says her private part was itchy and sometimes she was tempted to remove it, but owing to fear of soiling herself, she’d use another piece of cloth to scratch herself.\n\nRead also: Migori Jua Kali women keeping girls in school\n\nMeanwhile in Utawala, a middle-income suburb in Nairobi City County, Esther Ngare, a communication strategist loves using the reusable sanitary towels.\n\n“A friend introduced me to the reusable pads some time last year. She is a journalist. She visited a centre where they make the cloth pads and bought me a pack,” she says.\n\n“They are very comfortable. The part that comes into contact with your body has a cotton feel and you don't feel itchy like when you use the synthetic pads. I even stopped using the synthetic panty liners. The cloth pads serve me as pads and panty liners, and I’m happy with my shift. I’d vouch for them any time.”\n\nHaving loved them, Esther bought six more packs at Sh650 each. One pack contains three pieces.\n\n“I change pads at least four times during the day and twice at night. I have enough, so even if they take four days to dry, I have no problem. The only challenge is that they don't dry very well when it’s the wet season. So, I usually hang them near a heater to dry and warm them,” she says.\n\nWhile use of reusable pads removes the barrier of access to the menstrual hygiene product, the rainy season brings the risk of health problems for the women and girls from the low-income households like Aaliyah.\n\nAdequate supply\n\nAccording to Dr Maureen Owiti, an obstetrician gynaecologist, one can have a fungal infection from using damp cloth pads.\n\nA 2022 study on Intimate hygiene practices and reproductive tract infections: A systematic review, which looked into the exposure to urogenital infections by use of cloth pads established that drying reusable pads inside the house and storing them inside the toilet resulted in higher candida infection prevalence.\n\nBut for women and girls like Aaliyah who don't have the luxury of adequate supply, an infection is a burden they can't easily avoid.\n\n“I’d rather have the damp pad on me than go without. Better that way than walking in fear of blood dribbling down your legs,” says Aaliyah.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nMoraa Obiria", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4626332/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/8d0147a73c9479dac79d34b291be9c40/it/reusable-pads.jpg", "image_description": "A reusable pad made by a women's group  in Narok County.

{"title": " ", "content": "In late March, reports of violence against women began flooding into newspapers and onto TV screens as the pandemic picked up speed around the globe.\n\nWith over half of the world’s population living under lockdown, millions of women were trapped with an abusive partner, cut off from extended family and often with reduced access to support services due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nFor many women, the pandemic equalled a two-fold threat; coronavirus infections and being locked in a confined space while facing danger on a daily basis.\n\nIn the past nine months, all types of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic, have intensified, according to the UN.\n\nNow, despite most countries around the world tackling the coronavirus head-on, many of those same nations have failed victims of abuse through inadequate planning, funding and attention.\n\n“Men’s violence against women is also a pandemic, one that pre-dates the virus and will outlive it,” said UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in a statement to mark the annual International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women last month.\n\n“It too, needs our global, coordinated response and enforceable protocols. It too affects vast populations of all ages.”\n\nWorsening the situation is many governments’ failure to include protection for those abused as part of their Covid-19 response plans.\n\nAccording to data from the UN’s Covid-19 Gender Response Tracker, most nations are not doing enough to address the “economic and social fallout” caused by the crisis.\n\nLess than a quarter of the 206 countries analysed by the tracker treated violence against women and girls-related services as an “integral part of their national and local Covid-19 response plans,” with very few providing adequate funding for related services.\n\nThe global response has particularly failed women and girls in refugee settings and, displaced and post-conflict environments, according to a new report from the International Rescue Committee. Local women’s groups were critical to maintaining essential gender-based violence (GBV) support services during the pandemic, it adds.\n\n\n\nSet against this harrowing backdrop are ongoing economic pressures and widespread job losses, which have contributed to what the UN are calling a ‘shadow pandemic’.\n\nIn April, the agency estimated that for every three months of lockdown that continued, an additional 15 million women were expected to be affected by intimate partner violence.\n\nLast year, some 243 million women and girls experienced sexual or physical violence from their partner around the world. In 2020, reports of domestic violence, cyberbullying, child marriages, sexual harassment and sexual violence have increased globally, added Mlambo-Ngcuka.\n\nThe abuse is as global as the pandemic; from Brazil to China, Uganda to Nigeria, its alarming rise has been well-documented.\n\nIn the UK, the British government failed to prioritise domestic abuse in its lockdown arrangements and did not provide help for abuse victims fast enough by July. At least 16 domestic abuse killings took place between March 23 and April 12 in the UK, much higher than the average for the time of year, according to the Counting Dead Women project.\n\nAround the world, distress calls to abuse hotlines sky-rocketed, though official data isn’t always clear-cut.\n\nA women's hotline in Uganda reported a more than fivefold jump in the number of average weekly domestic violence cases reported once lockdown started in late March.\n\nThe British charity Refuge, meanwhile, reported a 700 per cent increase in calls on one single day in April. But in other places, such as Italy, official numbers decreased.\n\n“Sometimes, reported abuse cases are falling dramatically and you would think that violence is going down, but it’s just the opposite,” Christina Wegs, the global advocacy director for sexual and reproductive health and rights for CARE, told the Washington Post in September.\n\n“The drop is reflecting that women and vulnerable people are not able to report what’s happening.”\n\nIn fact, evidence shows that the pandemic has resulted in significant increases in GBV in nearly all countries, according to UNAids, especially for women trapped at home with their abusers.\n\nData compiled by UN Women in April this year across ten countries, including the United States, Singapore and Argentina, showed a heightened demand for access to women’s refuges and other support services, while shelters reached peak capacity in many places, made worse by the fact that some were repurposed for additional Covid-response programmes.\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, some countries took steps to respond to the warnings of soaring domestic abuse rates.\n\nCanada allocated $50 million to women’s shelters and sexual assault centres, while the government in New Zealand included preparations in its lockdown plans from the beginning (and have since pledged $141 million to domestic and sexual violence services).\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain each set up programmes to house people in hotels if existing emergency shelters were at capacity.\n\n\n\nIn Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are also plans to support organizations running shelters, while in Colombia and Sweden financial resources are being allocated to support GBV survivors.\n\nThere has also been action on the grassroots level. Women have been at the forefront of protests over the past couple of months in a bid to draw attention to domestic violence and demand government action.\n\nIn July, large-scale protests erupted in Turkey over the killing of 27-year-old Pinar Gultekin, a university student whose former partner was later arrested for her murder.\n\nGultekin is just one of 278 women killed in Turkey because of her gender since the beginning of the year, compared to at least 474 in 2019, the highest rate in a decade, according to the campaign group We Will Stop Femicide Platform. The final figures for 2020 are expected to be higher, given coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, feminist group Femen staged a topless protest outside President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in Ukraine last month.\n\nAnd in Mexico, protests to fight physical and sexual violence have taken over the city, with feminists kicking government workers out of the Human Rights Commission building last month to use it as a makeshift shelter for women fleeing violent homes.\n\nBut many fear this could be too little, too late.\n\n“The economics of violence are simple and devastating,” says Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka. “No one gains. Everyone loses, and we have to turn this around. We know what it takes to fight a pandemic. Now we need the will to do it.”\n\nThis story is a partnership between Daily Nation and The Fuller Project, a global non-profit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.\n\n", "author": "By \nLouise Donovan", "date": "Thursday, December 10, 2020 — updated on November 30, 2021", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3224164/portrait_ratio1x1/320/180/4e95b3ac68873aa67a5ce82a4b18c9b1/Lh/mlambo-ngcuka.jpg", "image_description": " ", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2020-12-10T04:00:00Z"}
{"title": "State urged to look into issues raised by intern teachers", "content": "As the nationwide work boycott staged by the 46,000 Junior Secondary School (JSS) intern teachers enters its second week today, unions have rallied behind the teachers while calling on the government to find an amicable way out of the stalemate.\n\nKenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) Secretary-General Collins Oyuu and his Kenya Union of Post Primary Education (Kuppet) counterpart Akelo Misori have warned that the strike risked paralysing learning in Grades Seven and Eight.\n\nWhile interns posted to regular primary schools earn Sh15,000, those in JSS are paid Sh20,000 , which they say is too little.\n\nA JSS teacher newly employed by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) is paid Sh34,955 a month alongside a commuter allowance of Sh5,000, a house allowance ranging between Sh16,000 and Sh8,133 depending on the work station, and a hardship allowance where applicable.\n\n“The employment of teachers as interns should have not taken place and we are in agreement with the High Court that [the arrangement] should be scrapped and the teachers hired on permanent and pensionable terms,” Mr Oyuu said in Nyeri County at the weekend.\n\nHe urged MPs and education stakeholders to address the issue and end the impasse for the benefit of both teachers and the learners.\n\nMr Malel Langat, the Knut first national vice-chairman, said TSC and the Ministry of Education should address the issues raised by the teachers and trade unions.\n\n“The intern teachers take home peanuts (Sh13,000 after deductions) while their workload is the same as that of their colleagues employed on permanent and pensionable terms,” Mr Langat said.\n\nThe Employment and Labour Relations Court has ordered that the terms for teachers serving on contracts remain in force till August 1, 2024. Justice Bryam Ongaya in an April 17, 2024 ruing said the TSC had violated the rights of the intern teachers to fair labour practices.\n\nHe said the TSC should employ teachers on terms that are not discriminatory and those serving on contracts should be confirmed on permanent and pensionable terms.\n\nThe first cohort of interns have had their contracts renewed for one year from February this year while the second lot is still serving their one year term.\n\n“Kuppet is ready to work with the National Treasury, the TSC, the National Assembly and the Ministry of Education to find a solution to the issue,” Mr Misori said.\n\nMr Ronald Tonui, the Kuppet assistant treasurer, Mr Henry Obwocha the secretary in charge of secondary schools and branch secretaries Mary Rotich (Kericho), Charles Ngeno (Narok), Paul Kimetto (Bomet) separately said the government should act on the matter and bring the strike to an end.\n\n“Parliament should set aside adequate funds to employ the intern teachers who are already engaged by the government, besides the others who are taken on board annually,” Mr Tonui said.\n\nMr Obwocha accused the TSC of lacking “goodwill to address the matter once and for all.”\n\n“We have had demonstrations at the county headquarters in the 47 counties in the past week, but we are changing tack this week by cascading it down to the sub-counties,” Mr Ngeno said in Narok on Sunday.\n\nTSC chairman Jamleck Muturi had in a statement issued on Tuesday last week called on the interns “to obey the court order and go back to school”.\n\nPresident William Ruto has stated that his administration has employed 56,000 teachers and another 20,000 are expected to be employed this year as the government seeks to bridge the teacher-student ratio in learning institutions.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nVitalis Kimutai", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4628408/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/e0bd8c4112dfe7a32dcc0e757f06461c/kn/new-content-item-1-.jpg", "image_description": "Junior Secondary School teachers hold a protest match along the streets of Kakamega town on Tuesday last week calling for interns to be employed on permanent and pensionable terms.\nPhoto credit: Isaac Wale | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-20T03:45:00Z"}

{"title": "Nikki Haley to end White House bid, clearing path for a Trump-Biden rematch", "content": "Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.\n\nHaley will give a speech at 10am local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time.\n\nShe will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added.\n\nHaley's decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests.\n\nHaley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the party's base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments.\n\nThe rematch between Trump, 77, and Biden, 81 - the first repeat U.S. presidential contest since 1956 - is one that few Americans want. Opinion polls show both Biden and Trump have low approval ratings among voters.\n\nThe election promises to be deeply divisive in a country already riven by political polarisation. Biden has cast Trump as an existential danger to democratic principles, while Trump has sought to re-litigate his false claims that he won in 2020.\n\nHaley, 52, had drawn support from deep-pocketed donors intent on stopping Trump from winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, particularly after she notched a series of strong performances at debates that Trump opted to skip.\n\nShe ultimately failed to pry loose enough conservative voters in the face of Trump's dominance.\n\nBut her stronger showing among moderate Republicans and independents - she won unaffiliated voters by a wide margin in New Hampshire and notched almost 40 per cent of the vote in South Carolina - highlighted how Trump's scorched-earth style of politics could make him vulnerable in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOn March 3, she won the Washington, D.C., Republican primary with 62.9% of the vote, versus 33.2 per cent for Trump. On Tuesday, her only win came in Vermont, a small, deeply Democratic state.\n\nBiden has his own baggage, including widespread concern about his age. Three-quarters of respondents in a February Reuters/Ipsos poll said he was too old to work in government, after already serving as the oldest U.S. president in history.\n\nAbout half of respondents said the same about Trump.\n\nKey issues\n\nAs in 2020, the race is likely to come down to a handful of swing states, thanks to the winner-take-all, state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the presidential election. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all expected to be closely contested in November.\n\nThe central issues of the campaign have already come into focus. Despite low unemployment, a red-hot stock market and easing inflation, voters have voiced dissatisfaction with Biden's economic performance.\n\nBiden's other major weakness is the state of the U.S.-Mexico border, where a surge of migrants overwhelmed the system after Biden eased some Trump-era policies. Trump's hawkish stance on immigration - including a promise to initiate the largest deportation effort in history - is at the core of his campaign, just as it was in 2016.\n\nVoters expect Trump would do a better job on both the economy and immigration, according to opinion polls.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, egged on by Trump, rejected a bipartisan immigration enforcement bill in February, giving Biden an opportunity to argue that Republicans are more interested in preserving the southern border as a problem rather than finding a solution.\n\nDemocrats are also optimistic that voter sentiment on the economy will shift in Biden's favour if economic trends go on rising throughout 2024.\n\nTrump may be dogged by his myriad criminal charges throughout the year, though the schedule of his trials remains unclear. The federal case charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 election, perhaps the weightiest he faces, has been paused while Trump pursues a long-shot argument that he is immune from prosecution.\n\nWhile most Republicans view his indictments as politically motivated, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, about a quarter of Republicans and half of independents say they won't support him if he is convicted of a crime before the election.\n\nBiden has argued that Trump poses a threat to democracy, citing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to reverse Biden's 2020 victory.\n\nAbortion, too, will play a crucial role after the nine-member U.S. Supreme Court, buoyed by three Trump appointees, eliminated a nationwide right to terminate pregnancies in 2022. The subject has become a political liability for Republicans, helping Democrats over-perform expectations in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nAbortion rights advocates have launched efforts to put the issue before voters in several states, including the battleground of Arizona.\n\nHaley thwarted\n\nHaley, a former governor of South Carolina, had been among the first Republican contenders to enter the race in February 2023, but she was largely an afterthought until garnering attention for her standout debate performances later in the year.\n\nShe put her foreign policy expertise at the centre of her campaign, adopting hawkish stances toward China and Russia and forcefully advocating for continued aid to Ukraine, a stance that put her at odds with the more isolationist Trump.\n\nBut she was reluctant to completely disavow her former boss - she served as Trump's U.N. ambassador - despite his four indictments and two impeachments. Trump showed no such reticence, frequently insulting her intelligence and Indian heritage.\n\nOnly in the last months of her campaign did Haley begin to forcefully hit back at Trump, questioning his mental acuity, calling him a liar and saying he was too afraid to debate her.\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, she became the standard-bearer for the anti-Trump wing of the party, a dramatic evolution for someone who just months earlier praised the former president in her stump speeches.\n\nStill, she said she would pardon Trump if he were convicted in any of the criminal cases he faces, a position she has never abandoned.\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Wednesday, March 06, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4537662/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/287b116bfb258c152743ec607d99eef6/cd/nikki-haley.jpg", "image_description": "Republican presidential candidate and former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley speaks as she brings her campaign tour to Troy, Michigan, US on February 25, 2024.\nPhoto credit: Rebecca Cook | Reuters", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-03-06T13:13:58Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "The national government has upgraded the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) in Kisumu to a Level 6 facility.\n\nLocals in Kisumu commonly refer to it as 'Russia Hospital', a name coined because of the good relations between Kenya and the Russian government.\n\nThe JOOTRH is one of the oldest health facilities in the country, serving thousands of patients in the Western region.\n\nThe hospital is located along the Kakamega-Kisumu Highway just before Kondele Police Station on a 55.6 acre land.\n\nThe elevation comes after a recent evaluation and inspection conducted by the Kenya Health Professional Oversight Authority (KHPOA).\n\nKisumu County Government had initially requested the national government to take over the running of the facility due to financial constraints.\n\nAccording to the JOOTRH administration, the health oversight body awarded the facility a score of 85 per cent after a recent inspection on August 1, 2023.\n\nBut what does the upgrading of the public hospital to a Level 6 facility means to local residents?\n\nFor starters, with the Ministry of Health taking over the facility, it shall be on the same level with Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), and Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital (KUTRH) which are run by the national government.\n\n\n\nFunds\n\nAnother advantage the facility is bound to have is the unlocking of funds especially from the national government and other partners, therefore enhancing the quality of services offered to residents.\n\nCurrently, 70 per cent of the hospital's resources come from the county government.\n\nThe regional referral hospital is serving patients drawn from 10 counties within the Lake Region Economic Bloc.\n\nThis has however been a thorn in the flesh of Governor Anyang' Nyong’o's administration since it had to run the Level 5 facility at its own operation cost.\n\n\n\nSurgeries and procedures\n\nAccording to the County Chief Executive Committee Member of Health Dr Gregory Ganda, the upgrading of JOOTRH means that the facility will now be equipped with both professional personnel and medical equipment to conduct high-level surgeries and save residents the agony of having to travel far to undergo such medical procedures.\n\nCurrently, the facility has 11 functional operational theatres, including general, Accident & Emergency, and three dedicated maternity theatres.\n\n\n\nService Delivery\n\nThe upgrade is expected to improve medical service delivery. For instance, the creation of consultation rooms to promote patients' privacy.\n\nWith sufficient funding, the facility can procure essential pharmaceutical products to improve access to quality care.\n\nThe hospital plans to erect relevant signage in respective service areas to ease the flow of service provision to patients.\n\nJOOTRH has a 13-bed ICU with operational patient monitors.\n\n\n\nCancer\n\nAlready the county government had started the construction of a cancer centre. But with financial challenges the project stalled.\n\nWith these hitches, Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Susan Nakhumicha pledged Sh100 million to complete the construction of the cancer centre.\n\nIf completed, the cancer centre will ultimately reduce the need for patients to travel long distances for cancer treatment.\n\nCelestine Agutu, a resident of Kisumu said that it will be a relief for cancer patients and those with chronic illnesses who currently seek services in Eldoret and Nairobi.\n\n“When the resources are available for the public facility, then there will be enough budget allocation and equipment to take care of the needs of the residents,” said Ms Agutu.\n\nPresently, the regional referral hospital offers oncology services for both adults and children.\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe health oversight authority pointed out that the facility needed to improve waste management within the hospital, increase the number of staff and streamline its emergency preparedness and outpatient department.\n\nThe authority also proposed that JOOTRH expand the Emergency and Accident department to accommodate more patients.\n\nPreviously the facility has been on the receiving end with complaints of drug shortage, blood and generally slow service delivery.\n\nKevin Otieno, a resident of Kisumu suggests that the national government employs more health workers at the facility to manage the increasing number of patients seeking medical attention.\n\n“The hospital needs to recruit additional staff, including critical care nurses, general nurses, medical officers, specialists and medical officer interns. This may necessitate increased budgetary allocations to support the growing workload,” said Mr Otieno.\n\nJOOTRH currently acts as a training ground for medical students from Maseno and Uzima universities.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the facility, CS Nakhumicha applauded Governor Nyong'o's administration for surrendering the management of JOOTRH to the national government and castigated some county governments that have clung to similar big health facilities, under the guise of generating on-source revenue at the expense of poor service delivery.\n\n“This is not good thinking because it has an effect on service delivery. Our people need quality health services closer to them and we must have a discussion on how to run these facilities and even the sharing of revenue,” she said.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nElizabeth Ojina", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4623714/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/1d9f0d8fa41ff57000ccf2ae3fc28597/lq/russia-hospital.jpg", "image_description": "Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu.  Photo credit: Ondari Ogega| Nation", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-15T12:47:21Z"}

{"title": "US government says Boeing in breach of fraud laws agreement", "content": "The US Justice Department said on Tuesday that Boeing Co BA.N had breached its obligations in a 2021 agreement that shielded the planemaker from criminal prosecution over fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a court filing in Texas that the US planemaker had failed to \"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\"\n\nJustice Department officials made the finding in the wake of a separate January in-flight blowout that exposed continuing safety and quality issues at Boeing.\n\nA panel blew off a new Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet during a Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines ALK.N flight, just two days before the 2021 agreement shielding Boeing from prosecution over the previous fatal crashes expired.\n\nThe determination exposes Boeing to a potential criminal prosecution over the 2018 and 2019 crashes that could carry steep financial penalties and tougher oversight, deepening a corporate crisis and reputational damage stemming from the January blowout.\n\nWhile Boeing is now subject to prosecution as a result of breaching the 2021 agreement, the Justice Department said in the court filing, officials will consider steps the planemaker has taken to address and remediate violation of the pact before determining how to proceed.\n\nThe Justice Department directed Boeing to respond by June 13 and intends to decide whether to prosecute Boeing by July 7, the filing said.\n\nManufacturing shortcuts\n\nBoeing confirmed it had received word from the Justice Department of its determination that the company breached the 2021 deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA.\n\n\"We believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue,\" Boeing said in a statement late on Tuesday.\n\n\"As we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement, including in response to their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident.\"\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment beyond the court filing.\n\nBoeing's ongoing crisis has already resulted in a management shakeup and government investigations. During a US Senate hearing in April, a Boeing engineer testified the company took dangerous manufacturing shortcuts with certain planes and sidelined him when he raised safety concerns, claims the company disputes.\n\nRelatives of people killed in the crashes and their lawyers, meanwhile, had argued that Boeing violated the 2021 deal with prosecutors, which required the company to overhaul its compliance program.\n\nIn-flight blowout\n\nFederal prosecutors had previously agreed to ask a judge to dismiss a criminal charge against the planemaker so long as it complied with the deal's terms over a three-year period.\n\nBut the January 5 in-flight blowout occurred just two days before the agreement expired. Justice Department officials weighed that incident as part of a broader probe into whether Boeing violated the deal, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.\n\nJustice Department officials are set to meet with family members of the victims of the previous fatal crashes and their lawyers on May 31 to discuss their decision, according to correspondence Reuters reviewed.\n\n\"This is an important first step towards holding Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 passengers and crew on the two flights,\" Paul Cassell, a lawyer representing victims' family members, told Reuters.\n\n\"But now the Justice Department needs to move this prosecution forward, vigorously and effectively towards a conviction.\"\n\nErin Applebaum, another lawyer for victims' family members, told Reuters that she and her clients were \"pleased that DOJ has chosen to do the right thing\" and hoped a prosecution would follow.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to resolve a criminal investigation into the company's conduct surrounding the previous fatal crashes.\n\nCostly change\n\nThe company agreed to compensate victims' relatives and overhaul its compliance practices as part of the deal with prosecutors.\n\nThe agreement gives U.S. officials six months from the deal's Jan. 7 expiration to decide whether to prosecute Boeing on a charge that the company conspired to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration or pursue other alternatives to dismissing the case.\n\nProsecutors can extend the 2021 settlement for another year or push for oversight by a court-appointed monitor, a costly change from the 2021 agreement where Boeing was allowed to oversee its own changes to its practices.\n\nThe Justice Department could also attempt to hit the planemaker with additional fines or push the company to plead guilty, an outcome that could affect Boeing's ability to secure government contracts, according to a Reuters review of prosecutors' actions following findings that companies violated other similar agreements.\n\nBreaches of such agreements deferring prosecution are rare. But the Justice Department under President Joe Biden has ratcheted up scrutiny on repeat corporate wrongdoers and has penalized companies that violate these deals.\n\nJust over a year ago, Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST agreed to pay a hefty fine and plead guilty after violating its own 2019 deal with prosecutors.\n\n", "author": "By \nReuters", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/1905742/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/34ffa7df63bc9b41596f7bca37863ae6/pl/boeing.jpg", "image_description": "Boeing 737 MAX\nPhoto credit: File | AFP", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-16T06:01:50Z"}
{"title": "Let’s talk! Confronting the age-old problem of sexual harassment", "content": "Early February, 23-year-old Esther*, started her two-month internship at a broadcast media company in Nairobi.\n\nShe is a Media and Communication student at a local university where she majored in electronic media. Two weeks into her internship, the company’s head of production, a male in his early 30s, started making unwelcome sexual moves on her.\n\n“Every time, he was around me, he could tell me I have a nice body and that he could not wait to have me in his bed,” she shares.\n\n“At first, I laughed it off. But the comments kept coming. He could call me in the middle of the night and tell me how he missed me, yet he and I were in the office, the whole time.”\n\nThis went on for about a week until she felt it was about time to make it clear that she wasn’t interested in his sex innuendos.\n\nIncidentally, both had plans to confront each other on the same day. She arrived at the office, ready to speak her mind, only for him to come to her desk, grab her hand and pull her to an outdoor garden.\n\n“I want to have sex with you. So when is that happening?” he asked her.\n\nEsther says she was shocked by his outright demand.\n\n“I told him I respect myself so much that I cannot sleep with him for just a night and walk away like nothing happened,” she says.\n\nFrom then, he started avoiding her and could not assign her any roles. She spent sleepless nights wondering what her next move should be, having been cut off from gaining practical experience. She reached out to a female colleague.\n\nIt is a small-scale company with less than 10 employees, she says.\n\nHer response was even more depressing: “He is known for that behaviour and there is nothing you can do. We don’t have guidelines on who to report to when that happens. Just let it go.”\n\nIt was until she threatened to tell his wife of his unprofessional behaviour that he changed and resumed treating her professionally – sending her out for assignments and according her the necessary support in line of duty.\n\nEsther’s experience is a definitive example of quid pro quo harassment, a form of sexual harassment in which employment decisions are made based on an employee’s acceptance or rejection of unwelcome sexual behaviour. In this case, the head of department withdrawing his supervisory role on her because she declined his demand for sexual relations.\n\nAvailable evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other.\nPhoto credit: Pool | Nation Media Group\n\nOffice of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\n\nSexual harassment is not limited to office space. It happens everywhere – from formal to informal interactions; in the online and offline spaces.\n\nIt happens on social media, markets, supermarkets, gyms, hotels, salons, tea buying centres, churches, banking halls or on the road as one heads to the shop or the river. The list is long.\n\nIn Kenya, sexual harassment is a criminal offence. Clause 23 of the Sexual Offences Act (2006) prohibits any person in authority or holding a public office from making sexual advances or requests. Such a person is liable to a minimum three-year jail term or penalty of not less than Sh100,000.\n\nThe Act further criminalises other forms of sexual harassment such as sexual assault, attempted rape and indecent acts. These offences attract a five to a 10-year jail term.\n\nBusia Woman Representative Ms Florence Mutua had through her Sexual Offences (Amendment), 2016 sought to further specify forms of sexual harassment.\n\nShe wanted “any contact between any part of the body of a person with the genital organs, breasts or buttocks of another …and exposure or display (of the same) or pornographic material to any person against his or her will,” to be criminalised. The bill failed to get the legislators’ approval.\n\nOn the other hand, previously under the Employment Act (2007), only companies with more than 20 employees were bound by law to have a sexual harassment policy.\n\nBut now, the Employment (Amendment) Act, 2019, demands of firms with more than five employees to have the policy. It should clearly state that each employee is entitled to employment that is free of sexual harassment, how to report the offences and redress measures thereof.\n\nScanty statistics\n\nDespite the existence of anti-sexual harassment laws, the reality of women and men becoming victims is evident.\n\nScanty statistics are available on offline sexual harassment. The media has, however, captured such cases. For instance, last year, a police officer in Nakuru was caught on camera pulling a suspect’s genitals in an attempt to force him to board a waiting police vehicle.\n\nFor online, studies on digital security have shown prevalence of sexual harassment. A 2016 joint survey by Association of Media Women in Kenya (Amwik) and Article 19 Eastern Africa established that some 75 per cent of female journalists in Kenya have suffered online harassment, these included sexual harassment.\n\nAvailable evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other, an indication of either the public’s ignorance or disillusionment.\n\nIt is possible to successfully litigate a sexual harassment offence.\n\nIn 2017, a Kericho Employment and Labour Relations court awarded a female clinical officer Sh600,000 as general damages for sexual harassment. In case 53 of 2017, the officer had sued her manager for sexual advances. She declined, a decision she argued to have prompted him to end her employment at the health facility.\n\nDiamond Trust Bank, Head of HR Ms Lillian Ngala, says a human resource officer is obliged to take action against claims of sexual harassment.\n\nIgnoring the complaints\n\nThe aggrieved member of the staff must, however, provide proof to the claim, which can be in form of emails, calls, texts or colleagues to whom one has confided.\n\nIgnoring the complaints could be tantamount to abetting sexual harassment in the workplace, a conduct that can lead to one losing certificate of practice with Institute of Human Resource Management, she says.\n\nShe observes that annual sensitisation of staff through strategies such as refresher courses and email reminders, are crucial to eliminating breeding ground for sexual harassment.\n\nEagle HR Consultants Chief Executive Officer, Mr Patrick Mutisya, adds that an employee has a right to seek justice through the court if the employer fails to take action within 14 days of notice.\n\n“The person who fails to take action is actually a collaborator (in abetting the offence),”says Mr Mutisya.\n\nBut to successfully prosecute such as case, one needs to provide concrete evidence such as an email or a letter, he advises.\n\nFederation of Women Lawyers-Kenya (Fida-Kenya) Legal Counsel, Ms Vivian Mwende says “when it comes to sexual harassment, the burden of proof lies with the person who is claiming sexual harassment.”\n\nLabour Policy Consultant at Learn Africa Solutions, Mr Alphonce Were says employers must purpose to educate their employees to avoid normalising sexual harassment.\n\n“Employees should be aware that sexual statements about their body parts are not normal jokes,” he says.\n\nThis is my story...Sabina Chege\n\nIn March 2018, Murang’a Woman Representative Ms Sabina Chege, found herself in the middle of a storm.\n\nAn alleged conman, Benson Chacha was using her number to solicit money from Cabinet Secretaries and her fellow MPs in addition to sending the MPs sexually explicit messages.\n\nIn March 2018, Murang’a Woman Representative Ms Sabina Chege, found herself in the middle of a storm.\nPhoto credit: Pool | Nation Media Group\n\nMs Chege together with 13 other female MPs reported the harassment to Parliament Police Station. When Directorate of Criminal Investigations, director Mr George Kinoti appeared before the National Assembly Committee on National Security to shed light on investigations of the matter, he said he had concluded that “there is special relation between the complainants and the suspect.”\n\nThis opened the floor for online sexual harassment against Ms Chege with a Twitter account even opened using her photo and that of the suspect, and using an implicating username. The account is still active to-date.\n\nLater, the DCI refuted the “special relation” statement but the damage was already done on the part of Ms Chege.\n\nThe harassment was “a worst case scenario,” Ms Chege says.\n\n“It is really sad even the way the police handled the matter. We are still in court. The court has delayed the case till to-day. If somebody at my level can be treated that way, what about an ordinary woman?” she wonders.\n\nFor nominated Member of the Nairobi County Assembly Ms Silvia Museiya, being spammed with sexually suggestive conversations on her phone and social media accounts is common.\n\n“I just ignore,” she says, “The moment you start indulging, it becomes a back and forth issue. There is an assumption that women in leadership have used sex to get up, and so the best way to handle it is to prove that you have a mind of your own, and that you are confident in your own space, and men can read that very easily.”\n\nUnsafe behind the wheel: An Uber driver and her ‘sexual advances’ journey\n\nWomen taxi drivers face the same security concerns as male drivers; however, they additionally face gender-dominated forms of victimisation.\n\nPeris Wangari Wanjiku, an Uber driver, recalls a time she picked a client in Langa’ta who wanted to go to Kahawa West. On their way, Ms Wanjiku says the client, who had been talkative for most of the trip disclosed he had no place to go and requested her to spend the night with him in the car.\n\nAs an act of kindness, and to avoid a confrontation, she decided to park her car at a petrol station along Thika Road, the safest place she could think of, until dawn.\n\nFor her, working as a taxi driver in Nairobi has been the most enjoyable and rewarding form of employment but it has come with a fair share of challenges.\n\nMs Wanjiku says most of her male clients make sexual advances at her and it does not amuse her anymore because she knows how to handle such behaviour. Some ask her for a date, while others make uninvited remarks.\n\nMany of her male clients, she reveals, start hitting on her the moment they start the journey. They will tell her how beautiful she is and request for a date.\n\nOn average, five out of every 10 male clients, she says, make sexual advances at her.This, she says, mostly happens at night when ferrying inebriated clients, with both young and old clients making unwelcome advances in equal measure.\n\n“Many start telling me they want to take me for coffee and get to know me because they are having issues with either their girlfriends or wives. They will shower me with compliments, saying they like aggressive and hard-working women like me, and not their lazy wives and girlfriends,” she says.\n\nKeen not to bring an argument or a misunderstanding in the course of their journey, Ms Wanjiku says she plays along and remains polite until they reach their destination. They then strike a deal that they talk over the phone the following day, as a gesture of politeness.\n\n“Many of them will call the following day and that is when I tell them I am married and a family woman who is only in business to fend for my family,” she says.\n\nOne time, she says, she got a request from a man of Chinese origin. When they got to their destination, she says the Chinese man looked at her, gave her some extra money and told her to go home and cook for the children.\n\nMs Wanjiku reveals that in her kind of business, she can only be polite to the male clients lest she losses business. What she ensures is that she does not allow the advances to go beyond limits.\n\nDespite the sexual advances, she says male clients are usually very friendly, generous and has never encountered a violent one.\n\nA gym instructor, his female clients and the limits\n\nThe gym is a great place for rejuvenating the body and mind. It can, however, be an intimidating and daunting place, making one feel vulnerable.\n\nLike many other environments, it is prone to sexual harassment with the most common types including being unnecessarily stared at, indecent touch, having one’s personal space invaded without invitation, and unnecessary comments about appearance.\n\nThe gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client. \nPhoto credit: Pool | Nation Media Group\n\nThe gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client. This is where the thin line between upholding professionalism and managing emotional attachment that comes with hours, weeks, months and even years of an instructor training one client comes in.\n\nStudies show that women are the most sexually harassed in the gym, but men too, are prone to harassment.\n\nArnold Opuka*, a gym instructor in Kisumu, is alive to this fact. When we meet him at his place of work, he tells The Voice that he has also been a victim of sexual harassment.\n\nSuggestive comments about their physique abound, with women referring to them as hunks, and suggesting which parts of their bodies the instructor should touch as they train.\n\n\"Many of these women, aged between 35 and 55 years, have money and easily influence young instructors. Some have fallen victims and lost their jobs,\" says Mr Opuka.\n\nHe reveals that the women are tactful, only giving glances with limited open expressions of their desire for someone. This, he says, requires a keen eye to notice the advances.\n\nAt times, especially during stretching exercises, some will do the routines suggestively.\n\nHe, however, reveals that the actual sexual advances happen during private sessions.\n\n\"The women are more open and tempt instructors by the manner in which they act around you,\" says the 31-year-old.\n\nHe adds that when these women come to the gym, their eyes are not only trained on the instructors, but also the young well-built men who work out in the gym.\n\nWhile most of these incidences appear consensual, he maintains that it is wrong and can be avoided, warning his colleagues against according specific clients special attention as that is bound to build attachment.\n\n\"Women are a jealous lot and that is why you have to treat all of them equally. Smile with all, psyche and assist all, and above all, be professional,” says Mr Opuka.\n\n\n\nHere's what constitutes sexual harassment\n\nUnwanted kissing, touching of breasts or genitalsButt slappingReferring to an adult as a girl, hunk, doll, babe, or honey Requests for sexual favoursMaking unwanted telephone calls.Repeated compliments of one’s appearanceSexually suggestive gestures, looks Discussing one’s sex life in front of othersCatcalls Ogling Cornering someone in a tight space Making sexual jokesSending sexually suggestive text messages or emailsLeaving unwanted gifts of a sexual or romantic natureSpreading sexual rumours about a colleagueRepeated hugs or other unwanted touching  (such as a hand on another’s back)\n\n[email protected], [email protected] and [email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nMoraa Obiria\n, \nRushdie Oudia\n & \nKamau Maichuhie", "date": "Friday, May 07, 2021", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/3391320/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/d5f7856e40bdbfb567b0eb48acb575d6/cg/sh-1.jpg", "image_description": "Despite the existence of anti-sexual harassment laws, the reality of women and men becoming victims is evident.\nPhoto credit: Pool | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2021-05-07T10:05:02Z"}

{"title": "Knut expresses concern over zero allocation to school feeding programme", "content": "The Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) has expressed concern over failure to allocate funds for school feeding programmes in the 2024/2025 budget, warning that this decision could lead to high dropout rates among learners.\n\nKnut Secretary General Collins Oyuu appealed to President William Ruto to intervene and restore the funding, which in the current financial year stands at Sh4.9 billion, emphasizing its importance for children from disadvantaged families and those in 26 banditry-prone counties.\n\nMr Oyuu, who criticised the move as counterproductive, said the budget withdrawal contradicts the President's commitment to sustaining the programme in schools.\n\nRead:  Millions to miss class as school feeding funds dry up in budget\n\n“The school feeding programme is critical to retaining learners in schools. Technocrats from the Treasury and the Ministry of Education should not disrupt it, let alone withdraw the funding,” Mr Oyuu said.\n\nThe 2024/2025 budget proposal by the Budget and Appropriations Committee does not include the school feeding programme, as shown in the State Department of Basic Education's allocation proposal.\n\nRecognising the critical role of schools in children’s lives, both in education and nutrition, the government and development partners initiated the School Meal Programme in 1980, aimed at providing mid-day meals to children in public primary schools especially those in arid, semi-arid areas and urban slums that are prone to drought and food insecurity.\n\nMr Oyuu who was accompanied by among others National Executive Committee members – Mr  Alfred Rop, Mr Francis Bundotich, Mr Josephat Serem, Mr Richard Lentayaa, Mr Sammy Bor, Ms Alice Bor and Ms Jecintah Kiptoo urged Parliament not to adopt the proposed budget without reinstating the programme's funding.\n\nFirst National Vice chairman Malel Langat stressed that removing the feeding programme in banditry-prone areas, where it had boosted enrolment and retention rates, would force children to drop out of school to help do menial jobs as they help their families survive, potentially leading to increased crime.\n\n“Withdrawing school feeding programme at a time the country is emerging from floods crisis that has killed almost 300 people, caused displacement of families, destruction of property and infrastructural facilities in learning institutions is ill-informed and should be reconsidered,” Mr Langat said.\n\n“We should look at expanding and entrenching school feeding programmes. Withdrawing funding for this noble program unnecessarily creates a crisis in affected learning institutions,” Mr Langat added.\n\nMr Oyuu also called on the government to enhance security around schools in banditry-affected areas, including Turkana, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Laikipia, and Samburu.\n\n“We need assurance from the ministries of Interior and Education on the security of learners and teachers. We have lost too many people due to escalating crime, schools have been closed and there is no assurance that proper measures are in place to end the menace,” the official said.\n\nRead: High Court declines to suspend the Sh5 feeding programme in Nairobi schools\n\nSeparately, Nyandarua Senator John Methu and Ndaragua MP George Gachagua have voiced their concerns over the removal of the school feeding programme as seen in the national budget proposal by the Treasury.\n\nThe leaders highlighted the critical need for reinstating the programme during the distribution of a Sh60 million bursary fund in Ndaragua Constituency.\n\nMr Gachagua emphasized the importance of increasing the education budget to support children from needy families. He noted that without the feeding program, the financial burden on parents would increase significantly, potentially leading to higher dropout rates.\n\n“I urge MPs to ensure the school feeding programme is reinstated in the budget. I will advocate for equitable resource distribution, ensuring all children in Kenya receive equal opportunities,” Mr Gachagua added.\n\n“We must invest in education by increasing the budget every financial year. Cutting the education budget for primary, secondary or tertiary institutions is unacceptable. We must fund our schools adequately,” said Senator Methu.\n\nHe called on both the Senate and the National Assembly to ensure that the education budget is protected and increased, emphasizing the essential role of education in national development.\n\n“We are in the budget-making process, and it’s crucial that our parliamentarians continue to prioritise investment in education,” Mr Methu said.\n\nA study by the African Population and Health Research Centre on the experiences of schools in implementing school meal programmes acknowledged the important role that the provision of meals plays.\n\nRead: Knut demands government change tact to fight banditry in North Rift\n\nIt said the school meals enhanced enrolment, attendance and concentration in class by the learners, highlighting that some of the students lack food at home and rely on the school meal as their only meal for the day.\n\nHowever, challenges persist in implementing these programmes effectively.\n\n“Financial constraints, including insufficient government funding and delays in fee payments from parents, often hinder schools’ ability to provide balanced meals,” the lobby said in its release on March 20.\n\nAs a result, most of the schools meals have little diversity, they mainly include cereals (maize/rice) and legumes/pulse (beans/green grams) and are often deficient in fruits, vegetables and animal protein that are important sources of nutrients required for optimal growth and development of children and adolescents,” the lobby said.\n\nThe 2023 study recommended increased government funding for school feeding programmes to enrich meal diversity and nutritional quality, expansion of school feeding initiatives to encompass low-cost private schools and implementation of school gardens and resource-efficient farming practices.\n\n[email protected], [email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nVitalis Kimutai\n & \nWaikwa Maina", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4624998/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/4caec266e4ae1d039ffa531acaa8e28a/kP/knut-ooyu.jpg", "image_description": "Mr Collins Oyuu, the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) Secretary General (centre) and Mr Malel Langat (right), the union's First Vice National Chairman and officials from 25 branches from Rift Valley region addressing journalists at Keriwest Hotel in Kericho on May 15, 2024.

You know, I am here, I have arrived.\n\nAnd I realised that it’s extremely burdensome especially when you are a woman because you are often put under surveillance.\n\nPeople are going to put you on a test; they want to see how you’re doing, how you’re able to manage the issues, conflicts, and all of that.\n\nBut as you grow into roles, you realise that everything has its own time to address it. Over time, throughout these different jurisdictions, I've learned there’s no need to rush in to prove yourself.\n\nIn basketball, there’s an interesting saying: “Lead with your offhand.” Whether you’re right or left-handed, it means developing your weaker side to become more well-rounded.\n\nJust like in basketball, as a woman, there’s the pressure to constantly ‘lead’ on all fronts – excelling in every area and being visible everywhere.\n\nAnd that's an unnecessary pressure that you put on yourself. But later in my career, I didn't necessarily think that was this important.\n\nIf you could tell me, drawing from what you've just said, you often travel alone, and your family still lives in India, how do you adjust to new postings, say the one in Kenya, with your family not around?\n\nYou know, it has both sides to it. The better part of it is that you go and start your work without having to think about family logistics.\n\nShaheen Nilofer is UNICEF's Representative to Kenya. \nPhoto credit: Pool\n\nBut the downside is you feel very lonely in the initial days, and it takes time to make friends. Work can easily become your whole world.\n\nThirty years in senior leadership positions is quite a long time. What has helped you to stay in those positions?\n\nWhen I reflect on my career path, it fills me with immense gratitude. It's been a journey of muddying my boots and soiling my hands, literally.\n\nI value those experiences very much because I understand the ground reality very well, from the development nuances to the interface between politics and development. I have worked in countries like Afghanistan, countries in South Asia, Central Asia and now, in Africa.\n\nI have seen the vast spectrum of developmental challenges across continents. The way the governments run, the geopolitics, the macroeconomics, and the situations there. These experiences have been extremely helpful for me.\n\nWhat do you love most about Kenya?\n\nI love travelling in this place. And I love the sheer green. This is one very beautiful country.\n\nWhat career advice would you give to those seeking to climb up the career ladder?\n\nNever give up too early. Because I know as a young professional woman, there are a lot of obligations that you will face. And sometimes it can take you on a guilt trip.\n\nYou know, like you are neglecting your family and other responsibilities. I say, embrace it but don’t let it hold you back.\n\nNotably, this applies in many ways to men too. Importantly, take every roadblock as an opportunity to grow, and enjoy what you're doing.\n\nWhat does tomorrow look like for a child in Kenya, and in any other part of the world?\n\nPrimarily, I do see there's a lot of hope and optimism. It is about ensuring that we come together because the time to act is now.\n\nAnd we just have about barely five to six years before we hit the finishing line to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)2030.\n\nI strongly believe that it is a doable proposition, and Kenya will be able to achieve its commitment to SDGs for children, if we can bring in our collective efforts, both in terms of our resources, ensuring that the fund flow for those commitments, and the budgetary allocations for the children are sustained.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nLilys Njeru", "date": "Friday, May 17, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4625810/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/106ce58e3ce43418147d369a7b64e937/Ab/shaheen-2.jpg", "image_description": "Shaheen Nilofer, UNICEF's Representative to Kenya. \nPhoto credit: Pool", "category": "Life & Style", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-17T08:14:41Z"}
{"title": "Why Mombasa traders feel left out of public participation forums", "content": "For the past week, Mombasa traders have been up in arms over new levies imposed by the County Government in the Mombasa County Finance Act, 2024.\n\nThe new levies targeting new revenue streams include alternative accommodation owners who will pay Sh25,000 yearly depending on the number of rooms and Miraa and Muguka traders whose levies increased per seven-tonne truck.\n\nMiraa and Muguka traders, who have come out guns blazing against the new rates, will now start paying Sh80,000, up from Sh24,000 a year.\n\nThese new charges in the Act have raised a storm in the Coastal city.\n\nOn one hand, traders claim they didn't receive a notice about the new taxes from the county government, while the county officials insist that public participation meetings were held.\n\nThis comes when the National Assembly is commencing public hearings for the 2024/2025 budget estimates.\n\nSo, what does it mean to hold public participation forums?\n\nPublic participation is a constitutional requirement. Specifically, Article 1 of the Constitution states that sovereign power belongs to the people.\n\nRead: Mombasa trucks parking fee rises in revenue drive\n\nSections 87 to 92 and 115 of the County Governments Act, 2012 outline the principles of public participation and the imperative for facilitating public participation in the work of the County government.\n\nPublic participation is a structured way of consulting with persons, groups and entities before making decisions affecting them.\n\nIn the case of a county government, public participation is designed to give a voice to the voiceless and cements the concept of agency to the County Government. That is, the county government becomes an agent of the people.\n\nPublic participation does not convey decisions already made but generates and confirms decisions. It is not a political process but a non-partisan process that involves the agent going to \"take instruction and direction\" from the people.\n\nMombasa Deputy Governor Francis Thoya said announcements across several media outlets, including social media pages managed by the Mombasa County Government communication teams, were made before the public barazas.\n\nHe says the forums were held in the first week of April on the dates and venues stated in the announcements in all six sub-counties.\n\nHowever, the deputy governor admits that attendance is often wanting, and this points to why complaints always arise at the implementation stage of the proposals.\n\n“Fact is, the public is increasingly becoming less interested in engaging in public participation. Mombasa residents no longer come for public engagement, the few who turn up there are just our friends, hecklers and busybodies,” said Thoya.\n\nRead: How Diani lost its lustre as prime destination for beach weddings\n\n“So what happens later? Immediately after those engagements were over…people who did not attend said they were not aware a decision was passed.\n\nThey see a gazette notice and start shouting,” he added.\n\nHe said counties have the capacity on matters to deal with public participation, but civil society should be brought on board to enhance citizenry participation in the forums.\n\nHuman rights activists led by Lucas Fondo said public participation is paramount in a democratic country.\n\n“We always sensitise and mobilise members of the communities to attend the forums to put their voices in all the county planning documents, policies formulated so that we have a democratic society,” said Fondo.\n\nFondo, who is also a member of the county budget and economic forum, said after communities give their memorandums and views, the county government should retreat, analyse the views, pick the relevant ones and include them in the final document.\n\nThere is a feeling among the public that their views are never factored into the final decisions, so such forums have lost meaning.\n\nThe Deputy Governor said mechanisms should be put in place to ensure public views find their way or answers provided as to why they were disregarded.\n\nRead: Short-stay homes in Mombasa to pay Sh25,000 annual licence fee\n\n“The government must explain to the people why it did not consider their views. This will develop the citizens' interest in public participation,\" he said.\n\n“This is also a concern. Let’s be candid, we need to understand where the problem is. We have problems in all the stages, first people don’t attend the forums and secondly, when they come their input gets nowhere. Eventually, some other things emerge by the end of the day,” said Thoya.\n\nAgenda Kenya Civil Society leader Otieno Obiero said residents perceive the public participation as a political rally.\n\n“Public participation is conducted in a way that depicts it as a political process. People partake in it as a political public rally hence they should be paid to attend. When there’s no money they don’t attend,” he said.\n\nHe said Kenyans don't understand why it’s important to attend the forums.\n\nResidents also don’t get the documents to analyse at least a week in advance as required by law.\n\nCivil societies also blamed the County Assembly for failing to oversight the executive.\n\n“The previous budget 2023/2024, we were shocked when the county assembly came for validation for a document that was not subjected to public participation. They have failed,” said Johnstone Kalama, from the Kwacha Africa organisation.\n\nHuman Protection and Justice organisation official Rokie Peter said the County Attorney should advise the executive on the legal proceedings that are supposed to be taken.\n\n", "author": "By \nWinnie Atieno", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4624704/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/137bc318b95214820ea8baff239504f4/gQ/majengo-market.jpg", "image_description": "Traders outside Majengo Market in Mombasa in this photo taken on February 25, 2024.\nPhoto credit: Kevin Odit | Nation Media Group", "category": "Counties", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-16T09:43:38Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "Had he not visited Narasha forest in Eldama Ravine sub-County, Baringo County last week, Stephen Mwangi, 19, would probably be in class today settling down at his Maji Mazuri Secondary School this first week of second term.\n\nLike the rest of the learners countrywide, the Form Three student was expected to report to his school on Monday as schools countrywide reopened.\n\nHowever, a phone call from his mother from Narasha Forest, Maji Mazuri on Wednesday last week, triggered a series of events that resulted in his tragic death a day after schools reopened.\n\nIn the forest, the teenager was allegedly assaulted by five officers from the Kenya Forest Service (KFS).\n\nHe sustained serious injuries and was treated at the Eldama Ravine Sub-County Hospital and later referred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) where he died.\n\nAccording to medical reports, the firstborn son in a family of six had a blood clot on his head, caused by a crack in the skull. His ribs were also broken.\n\nIt all started on Wednesday last week when the mother of the deceased, Mary Wambui, left for the farm in Narasha forest accompanied by her 11-year-old son to prune some trees.\n\nAfter a day’s work, Ms Wambui spotted and picked a tree stump in the forest to take home, intending to split it for firewood.\n\nRead: Police probe 18-year-old’s mysterious death after stepdad’s caning\n\nBut as fate would have it, the KFS officers accosted and detained her while accusing her of engaging in illegal logging.\n\nAccording to Ms Wambui, the two officers had detained her and demanded a Sh2,000 bribe in exchange for her release.\n\nShe only had Sh500 at the time of arrest. The officer declined to accept the money.\n\nDesperate, she called a neighbour and was able to raise an additional Sh1,000. Then she called her elder son, Mwangi, to bring her the balance of Sh500.\n\nWhile waiting for the money to be delivered, the two officers were joined by three colleagues.\n\nAccording to the mother, the officers rained kicks and blows, claiming she was being difficult.\n\nWhen he son arrived with the money, he was horrified to find his handcuffed mother being assaulted and sexually harassed by the officers.\n\nAll this was happening in the presence of Ms Wambui's younger son.\n\nWhen the late Mwangi demanded to know why the officers were harassing his mother, they turned on him, clobbering him with crude weapons, including a metal rod, before they fired three gunshots in the air.\n\nRead: Kakamega man kills brother over plate of omena\n\nFearing that they could die at the hands of the officers, Ms Wambui' raised an alarm that attracted passers-by.\n\n“By this time my son had been beaten to a pulp. He could not cry anymore. Tears were just flowing from his cheeks,” the distraught mother recounted.\n\nThe officers then requested a vehicle from their station, and when it arrived, they took mother and son to Eldama Ravine Police station where they booked her in the cell and told her they were taking her seriously injured son to the hospital.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ms Wambui’s mother (the late Mwangi's maternal grandmother) went to Eldama Ravine sub-County Hospital where she found her grandson in critical condition.\n\nHe was lying unconscious on the hospital bed in handcuffs, under the watch of the same officers who had assaulted him.\n\nThe mother was supposed to be arraigned in court in the morning but owing to her son’s condition was asked to pay a cash bail of Sh6,000 to secure her release and go and take care of her ailing son.\n\n“I was so shocked to find him seriously ill. He was not even talking,” said Ms Wambui.\n\nShe went back to the police station to record a statement on his son’s condition and was told she would be allowed to fill out a P3 form once some tests had been done.\n\nRead: Fight over meat in Busia village leaves two brothers dead\n\nOn Friday, she left her ailing son under the watch of his grandmother and went back home to look for money so that she could seek a referral because his condition was deteriorating.\n\nThe officers had told the medics that they didn’t have money to cater for the teen’s referral to MTRH, shifting the responsibility to his kin.\n\n“I had no more money to take him for specialised treatment but I had to do anything to save his life,” Ms Wambui told the Nation.\n\nShe had sold a donkey and two sheep and I managed to get some money. She then paid Sh8,000 for the ambulance to Eldoret where she had been referred to.\n\nThe journey to Eldoret happened on Saturday, with two KFS officers also on board.\n\nAt the referral hospital, the teenager underwent some tests and was given some injections before being admitted.\n\n“The medics at MTRH were shocked to see my seriously ill son still in handcuffs and instructed me to look for the officers who came and uncuffed him. His hands were already swollen,” she said.\n\nLater, the teenager developed breathing difficulties and was taken for a CT scan before being taken to the ICU as his condition worsened.\n\n\n\nEven with her son now fighting for his life in the ICU, the KFS officers stayed at the facility until the hospital staff had asked them to leave.\n\nMs Wambui's son's condition deteriorated and he succumbed around 11pm on Monday night.\n\nThe five KFS officers have since been arrested and arraigned in connection with the student's death.\n\nActing on behalf of the OCPD Eldama Ravine, Felician Nafula confirmed the arrests, adding that the case had been transferred to the DCI for further proceedings.\n\nFollowing the incident, angry residents of Maji Mazuri staged protests on Tuesday while accusing KFS officers of persistent harassment, particularly targeting women, children, and the elderly.\n\n“The mother of the deceased had requested his son to bring him some money the officers had demanded for, but on arriving at the forest, the boy found his mother being harassed, which prompted him to intervene,” claimed one Ms Susan Wacuka.\n\n“I visited the deceased at Eldama Ravine Hospital and his situation was very bad. Shockingly, he could not speak but was still in handcuffs. How inhuman were the officers for them to beat up that young man to death?\" she posed.\n\nMaji Mazuri MCA Solomon Kuria expressed concern over cases of violence by the KFS officers on area residents, noting that they target individuals collecting firewood in the forest.\n\nThe MCA called for a thorough probe into the incident and for the suspects to face appropriate legal consequences for their actions.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nFlorah Koech", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4624618/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/a6d65f5aaa5874e5bf0d467a442af7de/kG/suspects.jpg", "image_description": "The officers from the Kenya Forest Service when they appeared before the Eldama Ravine Law Court to answer to murder charges.

{"title": " ", "content": "“I can tell you it doesn’t sound like it’s going to be easy to make money on that platform,” said digital content creator and HIV/Aids crusader Doreen Moraa, when asked by the Nation about making money on Meta-owned social media sites-Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMs Moraa was reacting to an announcement early this week by Meta’s President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg, that starting June, Kenyan content creators will begin monetising their content on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe news also left many wondering how different this would be from what some content creators are already making from Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAlso Read: Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram to pay Kenyan creatives from June\n\nPresident of Global Affairs at Meta Sir Nicholas William Peter Clegg during an interview on Monday at Radisson Blu Aboretum Hotel in Nairobi.\nPhoto credit: Billy Ogada | Nation Media Group\n\n“There will be in-stream Ads on Facebook, Ads in Reels so you can have them on either side of your reels, Instagram gifts and stars. The whole suite of monetisation tools used by creators the world over will be available in Kenya,” Mr Clegg announced in a meeting with President William Ruto at State House, Nairobi.\n\nIn an interview, Mr Clegg told the Nation that the eligibility process in Kenyan will open in two weeks.\n\n“And a few weeks later within the next two or three months, creators will be able to use a whole range of tools to earn money directly from what they are doing online,” the former UK Deputy Prime Minister stated.\n\nBut for Ms Moraa and a host of Kenyan content creators, who spoke to the Nation over the announcement, the news should be welcomed with caution.\n\n“It is good news because for the longest time, a lot of content creators from other countries have been enjoying monetisation. For instance, I have a friend in South Africa who gets paid directly by Meta (Facebook’s parent company),” Ms Moraa says.\n\nAlso Read: Tiktok to launch subscription model for content in Kenya\n\nHowever, she is sceptical about how easy it would be for one to directly cash-in from the planned Facebook monetisation programme.\n\n“Yes it’s a good thing but the eligibility requirements are tough. Take for example the 60,000 minutes of views, for someone like me who creates content every day — with 131,000 followers, I am at 29,000 minutes. How long will it take someone with 5,000 followers who is also eligible?” Ms Moraa wonders.\n\nShe argues that the eligibility requirements are almost similar to those of YouTube.\n\n“By the time I was getting to 4,000 minutes watch time on YouTube to be monetised for the first time, I had worked so hard. By the time I was receiving that first YouTube payment of Sh20,000, I was on my 50th video, a year and a half had elapsed. I was giving up. If at all these monetisation programme is all about bettering content creator as they say, then why make it hectic for them?”\n\nTo be eligible to earn from content via Facebook as announced by Mr Clegg, for the live videos, one will need to have a minimum of 10,000 followers, 600,000 total minutes viewed in the last 60 days with at least 60,000 minutes of the total 600,000 minutes viewed in live videos.\n\n“This is next to impossible. Meta honestly needs to review those requirements for the creatives. We have micro content creators— those with 5,000 to 10,000 followers— but who do have content that is thoroughly engaging and have the interactions,” she says.\n\n“Let’s face it, the probability of such a content creator attaining 60,000 minutes’ views just to earn, is very little. It would be reasonable to give them reasonable requirements which are regularly reviewed as they progress,” Ms Moraa adds.\n\nActor and content creator Martin Githinji says he will have to wait until the programme fully comes to effect to have a concrete position.\n\nAlso Read: Ruto - Facebook, Instagram to start paying Kenyan content creators\n\n“I don’t know what to make of it now, it could be some random announcement made for political gains. The Facebook president said its coming by June, I would want to believe that. As of now we are not making money directly from either Facebook or Instagram, we only make money when brands collaborate with us,” he says.\n\nHe adds: “ But my understanding is that Instagram and Facebook want to be like YouTube. However, Instagram and Facebook are a bit complicated. Unlike YouTube where you go to watch videos, on the others you are mostly there to interact on a social level. And it’s from that social level interaction that some businesses are able to capture that interaction and use it to sell things.”\n\n“On how it will work, it might not be as clear as YoutTbe. But still even in its clearness there is a catch, like when they talk about CPMs (Cost per Millie) where they give other countries high CPM than others. If you are to upload a video while in the States, it does better than when you upload one while in Kenya. So for Facebook and Instagram, we don’t know the mechanisms of how it’s going to work,” Mr Githinji says.\n\nHe however, appreciates the fact that the monetisation will open a new way for content creators to make money but is sceptical about the push by Kenyan politicians who are making it look easier than it really is.\n\nDigital creator Brian Mutinda, doesn’t think he will be exploiting that avenue to make extra coins should it be rolled out.\n\n“I know Meta is both Facebook and Instagram but there is a bit of biasness on Facebook which I am not keen on. I am only focused on Instagram, I don’t create content on Facebook,” Mr Mutinda says.\n\nOn how easy it’s been touted that it will be to cash in from the Facebook monetarisation programme even for the disinterested Mutinda, he doesn’t think it will be easy for those content creators who would opt for that avenue.\n\n“Nothing comes easy, I have seen some split sheets from countries that have already been monetised and you will realise you will need to have a lot of views and I mean a lot of them to make something. It’s not like you collect 10,000 views and make Sh10,000 that’s not going to happen. But on the flip side, for those coming up, it will be a good avenue for them, especially for those content creators who don’t have brand deals,” Mr Mutinda says\n\nAnother issue that could be of concern is the mode Facebook will employ when disbursing the earned money.\n\nHe describes what he thinks is a “tedious” process by sites like YouTube, starting with receiving a Personal Identification Number physically to activating your account, before sharing bank details for money to be wired.\n\n“I hope with Meta, the process can be simplified by paying through one’s PayPal account or M-Pesa,” says Ms Moraa.\n\nWill the monetisation be the better option as touted and averagely what will one be expecting from the programme?\n\n“It depends on how successful they are (content creators). It depends on how engaging their content is. We don’t run their business for them. I think the thing to remember about us is that we are a platform for others to build great businesses. We build the tool and people have to decide for themselves whether they use the tools or whether they don’t,” Mr Clegg said.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nSinda Matiko", "date": "Saturday, March 23, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4560412/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/2be6ba9e2dbecc35bd6d63d7622d05d7/uf/meta-platforms.jpg", "image_description": "Content creators in Kenya will earn money from postings on Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram.", "category": "Business", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-03-23T04:00:00Z"}

I am happy to be living my dream,” she says.\n\nThe journey has not been easy, she says.\n\n“Some victims are compromised by their tormentors and corrupt administrators like chiefs to withdraw the cases,” Ms Karanja says.\n\n“I can sometimes pursue a GBV case when about to reach the end for the abuser to be apprehended, the victim withdraws.”\n\nAnd that is not all. Ms Karanja has had to deal with situations in which victims come to the defence of their abusers.\n\nAlso Read: Joint campaign targets matatu crews in war on GBV\n\n“One woman even told me her abuser was mentally ill and that she had taken the decision to forgive him,” she says.\n\n“This was a nurse who almost died at the hands of her abuser. The man attempted to strangle her with a mosquito net. She was ready to withdraw the case against him despite living on borrowed time.”\n\nApart from the above challenges, Ms Karanja has had to face accusations of being a home and marriage-breaker.\n\n“Some men blame me for being a homewrecker yet it is their girlfrirends or wives who report these cases to us,” Ms Karanja says.\n\n“They do not choose to report to police but come to YAWI. They are comfortable opening up at YAWI instead of police since we cannot be compromised.”\n\nA woman once sought refuge at YAWI offices when her husband threatened to throw her in a dam for refusing to reveal where she was getting help.\n\n“These kinds of threats are mostly from wealthy husbands who fear being exposed in courts of law,” she says.\n\nSome of the cases YAWI handleS are intriguing. Ms Karanja cites a woman she offered psycho-social support after her husband of 30 years.\n\nAlso Read: Study: Intimate partner violence curtails HIV viral suppression\n\n“This man was not comfortable with the fact that his wife was not a virgin when they met. The violence against her may not have been physical but was emotional for he kept using unprintable words against her ,” says Ms Karanja.\n\n“This clearly shows many sufferin women have not identified GBV red flags. Victims of GBV – both women and men – should walk out of such unions. They should not be bound by factors like property as that might translate to death.”\n\nThe progress Ms Karanja has made in ensuring the right of women and girls to live free from abuse has kept her going.\n\n“I have never felt like I want to quit. I feel great when when people get justice,” she says.\n\n“I will continue stepping on the accelerating pedal to help identify, prevent and remedy violence at home and in the workplace, with a strong focus on gender.”\n\nHer work faces many hurdles, chief among them being delays in courts and police stations.\n\n“Barriers to justice are concentrated in the corridors of justice. It is annoying to see an officer demanding a birth certificate to prove that a 13-year-old girl was raped by a 50-year-old man,” Ms Karanja says.\n\n“Sexual misconduct, assault, child abuse and related crimes do not require a birth certificate for proof.”\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nFrancis Mureithi", "date": "Saturday, December 09, 2023", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4458156/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/d5541e32f3ddf099e26da48ff2b2865/oJ/fidelis-wambui-karanja.jpg", "image_description": "Ms Fidelis Wambui Karanja the CEO of Young African Women Initiatives (right) monitors women taking a tailoring course at a centre in Bondeni, Nakuru County.\nPhoto credit: Francis Mureithi | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2023-12-09T04:00:00Z"}
{"title": "How dearth of black women in clinical research worsens health", "content": "For many, the July 2023 announcement was a cause for celebration and optimism: The Food and Drug Administration had approved a new Alzheimer’s drug, Leqembi, which appeared to slow the progression of the disease in its earliest stages.\n\nBut would it help black women, the group of people that data shows is most disproportionately impacted by the disease? Researchers wish they could say—but a critical shortage of black women in the study leaves them unable to adequately assess the answer.\n\nOnly 10 black women in the US had received Leqembi when scientists were testing it—less than 1 per cent of the some-1,800 participants in the 18-month trial. This, despite the fact that two women are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s for every man, and that black women are twice as likely as white women to experience its devastating effects.\n\n“That’s just bad science. It’s not representative of the people who are disproportionately affected,” says Carl Hill, chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer for the Alzheimer’s Association. “Without appropriate participation, it’s impossible to get a complete and accurate understanding of Alzheimer’s in the US, much less efficacy and safety.”\n\nFDA spokespeople declined to answer questions about the Leqembi approval process, saying in a statement, “We continue to encourage sponsors to increase the enrolment of all racial and ethnic populations, including black individuals, into their ongoing studies.”\n\nThe lead drug maker, Tokyo-based Eisai Co., said in a statement that while it “would have liked more African- Americans in [this] trial, it is important to remember that patients across all subgroups benefitted from treatment with Leqembi.”\n\nWhy black women and women of colour in general are severely under-represented in trials like this is a complicated stew of issues that have federal health officials scrambling for answers and activists demanding more be done to erase the inequities.\n\nSome like Hill blame racism as a factor. Others note the dispiriting drop in voluntary participation by black and Hispanic women in such trials. For example, black participation saw the steepest drop over the past decade— from a peak of 12 per cent in 2013 down to 7.0 per cent in 2021, a far cry from their 13 per cent share of the US population, according to government statistics.\n\nThe reasons for this? Many think it harks back to a long memory by the African-American community of how scientific research once used them as guinea pigs. The well-documented mid-century Tuskegee experiment that withheld life-saving penicillin from black men with syphilis still haunts black communities and research circles.\n\n“Black folks remember Tuskegee,” says Nadine Spring, who manages community-based research, most recently at the Atlanta-based HIV-prevention group SisterLove.\n\n“Then you have, most of the time, a white research coordinator going to someone who looks like me and trying to say, ‘Hey, this study might benefit you.’” The response varies from, “I’m not going to be your guinea pig,” to “I’m interested, but I need more time,” Spring says.\n\nThe distrust has snowballed into its own stigma and created a narrative that misrepresents some communities as simply too “hard to reach,” Spring says. While understandable on one level, the reluctance has serious downsides.\n\nWithout adequate representation in these types of landmark studies, efficacy of these life-saving drugs for black women remains elusive—it’s possible they could be prescribed treatments that work well for the vast majority of the women in the study but not for them.\n\n“Because certain groups, often women of colour, haven’t been included in those trials, we may not actually have evidence for them,” says NiCole Buchanan, a psychology professor at Michigan State University who studies discrimination in research.\n\n“We have sub-standard for some being masked as gold standard for all.”\n\nThe Fuller Project analysed National Institutes of Health trial data from 2018 to 2021, the most recent statistics available, and found that certain research areas stood out for their disproportionate under-representation of black women.\n\nFor example, although black women are more likely than other women to die from cervical cancer, they make up just three per cent of enrolment for vaccine research on HPV that can cause the cancer.\n\nFor ovarian cancer trials, black female enrolment sits at five per cent though death rates are spiking for black women while declining for others.\n\nThe clinical trials gap persists despite efforts to close it—efforts that activists think aren’t rigorous enough. Until researchers began in the 1990s sounding the alarm, the efficacy of a great deal of medical therapeutics was based almost exclusively on how they worked on white men.\n\nThirty years ago, Congress directed the NIH to include an equitable number of women in clinical trials. Since then, white women have gained ground, but black women largely continue to be left out. By 2020, there was one black woman for every 10 white women in FDA-approved drug trials, according to research.\n\nThere are some signs of change. In an effort to get more people of colour into clinical trials, the NIH launched the ‘All of Us’ campaign in 2018 to build a single repository of diverse participants that can be used for various studies.\n\nOf the nearly one million participants, only half provided race information, and they were majority white. But, because researchers can pick and choose participant data within the trove, they are starting to identify never-before seen genetic data that will inform future research.\n\nIn 2022, a congressionally mandated report from the National Academies of Sciences called for “urgent actions by federal agencies, Congress, journals, and others to improve the representation of racial and ethnic minority groups and other underrepresented populations in clinical trials and research.”\n\nOne finding was that clinical trial organisers may allow themselves to be too discouraged by the “community fear” issue when recruiting from communities of colour. The approach makes the difference. Evidence shows that these communities “are no less likely, and in some cases are more likely, to participate in research if asked,” the report says.\n\nIt notes that the design of trials are critical—that when organisers invest time with trusted community partners at the start of research design, meet patients where they are, and hire diverse recruitment staff—people of colour are willing to participate.\n\nAnd facing increased pressure from government watchdogs and influential researchers at the National Academy of Sciences to improve diversity, President Biden in 2022 signed a law that for the first time mandated the FDA to require “diversity action plans” from researchers.\n\nSince June 2022, the agency has been reviewing public comments to finalise the rule, which means drug makers likely won’t have to submit plans until later this year.\n\nFDA officials declined to comment on how and if researchers will be held accountable to follow the plans. And some worry that the law with its long list of “non-binding recommendations” doesn’t have the teeth to make substantial change.\n\nThat’s why some advocates like Hill of the Alzheimer’s Association say the federal government should mandate the composition of racial and gender participation in clinical studies.\n\n“When representation is a criteria for funding and approval, you will see a change,” he says. But the NIH and FDA have been slow to force researchers—including those at pharmaceutical companies, universities and hospitals—to make trials more inclusive, and the harm is compounded by lack of data showing the extent of the problem, research shows.\n\nPresident Biden in March, announced a $200 million investment and prioritisation for women’s health research, including a specific carve out for women of colour.\n\nResearchers who focus on sex differences and health disparities have long called for this and widely celebrated the announcement—with some noting that holding federal agencies accountable to the new commitment will be a continued obstacle.\n\nEquity advocates contend an obvious answer: diversifying the workforce that is conducting trials. When academic journals have editors of colour, more researchers of colour get published, according to the study “Racial Inequality in Psychological Research.”\n\nIn another widely noted study, doctors of colour help patients of colour improve health outcomes. Research enrolment diversifies when black and brown researchers are in charge, other studies show. Currently, black women comprise just one per cent of research leads.\n\nThe Association of Community Cancer Centres recently developed an implicit bias training programme for oncologists called “Just Ask.”\n\nSometimes patients lacked access to trials simply because physicians worried that asking might overwhelm them, says Dr Julie Gralow, chief medical officer for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. “It wasn't malevolent,” she says, but the outcome was the same—excluding people of colour.\n\n“It was a benevolent bias. You thought you were protecting the patient, but we should let the patient decide.”\n\nThe ordeal of Bridgette Hampstead, a resident of Seattle, illustrates the problems black women sometimes face when confronting cancer. Hampstead was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996—a diagnosis she says was delayed because her doctor wouldn’t approve a mammogram, saying it was unnecessary.\n\nAfter finally demanding the screening, it showed the need for immediate treatment—a full mastectomy. She’s convinced the delay and invasive response could have been avoided if providers had been trained in more inclusive research, she says.\n\nResearch from the American Cancer Society suggests the same. Clinical trials that might have helped her were available at the time but she says she was never offered one.\n\nSince then, she’s devoted her life to helping Black women victims of cancer avoid similar ordeals. Her Seattle-based non-profit, Cierra Sisters, derived from the Swahili word for “knowledge,” works with local Black women to ensure they have accurate information after a cancer diagnosis, get appointments with doctors who understand racial disparities and can access clinical trials.\n\nBlack women are 40 per cent more likely to die from breast cancer than white women—a gap that has steadily widened since the 1990s, in part because the overall death rate has improved, research shows.\n\nThough black and white women develop breast cancer at a similar rate, black women are more likely to develop aggressive forms and are slower to get diagnosed.\n\n“After 27 years you'd think it'd change, but it has not changed,” Hampstead said. “My community is still dying.”\n\nThis story was published in partnership with The Fuller Project\n\n", "author": "By \nErica Hensley", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4625194/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/aec5c03e1a1bc29f99f6579b26a67504/UK/gettyimages-2030190156-2048x1365.jpg", "image_description": "A woman during a routine check-up with her doctor.\nPhoto credit: Photo I Pool", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-16T15:36:24Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "Dr William Ruto rode to power by rallying “hustlers” against high taxes by then-President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration.\n\nIn his rallies, he consistently hit out at Mr Kenyatta for “not understanding the damage he is doing to the people and the economy with these taxes he is increasing”.\n\nHe sold lofty promises of bringing down the cost of living and prioritising the needs of low-income earners. The President’s critics say he has made an about-turn on the pledges.\n\nDr Ruto has become the lord of taxes, earning the moniker “Zakayo” (Zacchaeus), in reference to the Biblical tax collector, who climbed a tree to have a glimpse of Jesus Christ.\n\nReaction to proposals in the Finance Bill, 2024 have reignited debate on tax. Opposition Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition has told the President to “climb down”, but Dr Ruto appears to have no apologies for introducing taxes every year.\n\n“I don’t mind being called names. I will continue to do the right thing for our country,” he said days ago.\n\nAlso Read: Why Ruto will struggle to keep his promises to the ‘Hustler Nation’\n\nThe President and his allies say Kenya’s “unsustainable” debt burden is the driver of his administration’s thirst for cash, which they claim is being balanced by spending cuts and other austerity measures.\n\nIn the first Kenya Kwanza government budget that took effect on July 1, 2023, the 16 per cent value-added tax (VAT) was controversially reinstated on petroleum products.\n\nThe government also increased sales tax for small traders, significantly reduced take-home for salaried workers by introducing the much-maligned 1.5 per cent housing levy and 2.7 per cent for the Social Health Insurance Fund expected to start this July.\n\nAlso Read: Fulfilling ambitious election pledges tough juggling act for President-elect\n\nIn the Finance Bill, 2024, the National Treasury proposes to raise tax on bread, mobile money and banking services as well as impose an annual tax on vehicles.\n\nPresident Ruto defended these levies and talked of raising tax revenues as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product to 22 per cent from the current 14.\n\n“My drive is to push Kenya, possibly to 16 per cent this year. I want to leave it at 20 or 22 per cent over my term. It is going to be difficult and I have a lot of explaining to do. People will complain but I know they will appreciate it,” he told Harvard Business School students.\n\n“Kenyans have been socialised to believe that they pay the highest taxes in the world but data show that as of last year, our tax as a percentage of GDP was 14. Our peers on the continent are at 22 to 25 per cent. Countries like France are at 45 per cent, others are higher.”\n\nAlso Read: Issues Ruto must balance with his promises to ‘hustlers’\n\nBut Prof XN Iraki – an economics lecturer at the University of Nairobi – says Kenyans are actually being overtaxed if levies and taxes are factored into the equation. He raises queries on how the taxes are eventually used.\n\n“What matters is what we do with that tax, not the ratio. A higher ratio is not a guarantee that tax will be prudently used. It could mean shifting money from the productive private sector to public,” Prof Iraki said.\n\n“We should focus on growing GDP as that will mean more money to pay more taxes. One wishes the ratio goes up because we have more money and our tax rate has gone up.\n\n\"Tax is progressive. Higher tax to GDP ratio would lessen the debt burden if we reduce borrowing and raise enough tax revenues without slowing down the economic growth. We still have a deficit despite higher and more taxes.”\n\nMr Ken Gichinga, Chief Economist at Mentoria Economics, says the Kenya Kwanza administration is focused on taxing consumption, describing it as regressive. He says the approach by Dr Ruto has a potential of slowing economic growth, with the government not meeting revenue targets.\n\n“If we have progressive tax system, Kenya will raise enough revenue without disrupting the economy.\n\n\"But if we have a regressive policy, we might not hit the revenue targets. It could actually cause a slowdown of the economy and increase the cost of living,” said Mr Gichinga, adding that many companies may close shop.\n\nAlso Read: Ruto pledges Sh50bn for SMEs\n\nRegressive tax policy is consumption taxes of everyday goods.\n\n“We need to focus on a progressive tax policy. When you get a promotion and earn a higher salary, for instance, the government will collect more revenue and it does not disrupt the worker. Focus in the developed world is creating jobs,” Mr Gichinga said.\n\n“Once more people have income, it becomes easy to collect tax. In Kenya, unfortunately, we start with tax. It has made it very difficult for companies to operate.”\n\nIn analysing the Finance Bill, 2024, audit firm KPMG highlights the implications of the new taxes. It says they are likely to make life expensive.\n\nAlso Read: President-elect Ruto promises to increase tax revenues\n\nThe company says the introduction of the annual 2.5 per cent tax on cars was due to the increasing number of vehicles on Kenyan roads.\n\n“It comes against the backdrop of revised insurance premium rates and high fuel prices, inevitably shoring up the cost of operating a car. This will have a negative impact on transport and logistics, which may pass the additional cost to customers and thus escalate the cost of living,” KPMG said.\n\nOn the proposed VAT on bread from zero, it says the price of the basic food item will shoot up.\n\n“The proposal to change the VAT status of bread has found its way into previous Finance Bills. We hope the proposal will again be dropped when the Act is enacted,” says the document by the company.\n\nThe Kenya Bankers Association has appealed to the National Assembly to reconsider the proposed 16 per cent VAT on transactions, saying it would hamper financial inclusion, particularly affecting low income earners and small businesses.\n\n“Coupled with excise duty, the total tax on financial services would reach 40 per cent from the current 15, significantly impacting affordability and accessibility,” the association said.\n\nIt expressed surprise at the bill seeking to introduce VAT on financial services, including issuing credit and debit cards, telegraphic money transfer, foreign exchange and cheque handling.\n\nThe Associated Battery Manufacturers raised concerns over the proposed tax of Sh750 per kilo of battery weight.\n\nGuy Jack, the Group CEO, says a lead acid battery weighing 12 kilos and retailing at Sh8,500 will go for Sh17,500 once the proposal is implemented.\n\n“This is unsustainable and will result in the destruction of the industry,” Mr Guy said.\n\nNational Assembly Minority Leader, Opiyo Wandayi, said Azimio would oppose the taxes, describing them as punitive and with a potential of hurting poor households.\n\n“The taxes are unjustifiable. The tax base will shrink as many people will find ways of dodging taxes,” the Ugunja MP said.\n\n“The government should have focused on spurring economic growth by supporting production, which would then enhance disposable income. The common man will suffer because the taxes will still end up in the pockets of few individuals,” he said.\n\nThere is a general feeling among Kenyans that taxes are being squandered by the political elite.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nMoses Nyamori", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4477600/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/f0bdc22be4fc54dc04e14078cffe4f42/kW/hustlers.jpg", "image_description": "UDA Presidential Candidate William Ruto addressing his supporters at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi on August 6,2022 during a campaign rally.

{"title": "Inside Maasai community where men are championing women’s land rights", "content": "As the scorching sun beats down on Musul area in Laikipia County, members of the Musul Community Land Management Committee (CLMC) gather to deliberate on matters affecting their community. Leading today's discussions is James Ruso, the local chief, who is meeting with the committee to address pressing concerns.\n\nOne of the key topics on the agenda is the management of grazing land, as the region braces itself for the impending dry season. With pastures expected to dwindle, the committee must devise strategies to ensure sustainable utilisation of the available resources, safeguarding the livelihoods of the local pastoral communities.\n\nWhat makes this meeting extraordinary is the presence of more than half of the representatives being women. Just a few years ago, their attendance would have been considered a taboo, and their active participation would have been deemed even more abnormal.\n\nRead also: One plot at a time: Pastoralist women shaping the land ownership narrative\n\nAccording to Chief Ruso, in the past, Maasai women were not allowed to attend or address men in such important meetings. \"Women were totally not expected to be here, and if their presence was required at all, they would merely be there to make up the numbers,\" he explains.\n\nHowever, today, things are different. Women not only have the right to speak but also to voice their concerns and participate in decision-making and voting processes.\n\n\"It's not just men who have the right to talk now; even women will voice their concerns, and they are part of the decision-making and voting,\" explains Elijah Ruso, who, at just 22 years old. He has defied age barriers to become the community's grazing/rangeland chair.\n\nThe shift in dynamics is palpable, as traditional gender roles are being challenged, and women are asserting their rightful place in shaping the community's future.\n\nThis change is thanks to the 2016 Community Land Act (CLA) enacted by the Kenyan Government. \"After its implementation, it replaced the Land Group Ranch Registration Act and the Trust Land Act, where community members were registered as land owners,\" explains Justice James Olalo of the Nyeri Environment and Land Court.\n\nIt also comes with the Digital Land Governance Program. According to Husna Mbarak, Land Governance Program Manager of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), this secures the land tenure system, a legal framework that defines the appropriate mechanisms for allocating, transferring, using or managing property rights in relation to land matters.\n\n\"Also, other than looking into the potential of a particular landscape concerning the available resources, there is an aspect of land zoning, which plays a crucial role in determining how it is used, for instance, space for settlement or cultivation,\" she adds.\n\nLegal rights\n\nIn October 2020, the Musul community received the title deed to their community land. Before this, like thousands of rural and indigenous communities in Kenya, the Maasai community of Musul lacked clear legal rights despite living on the same land for generations, putting them at high risk of exploitation.\n\nBefore this enactment, only men were allowed to be on the land registry, and the few at the top had a superior say, which was almost absolute. \"And this had tremendous negative effects on our community where a few high-ranking men within the group would make decisions pertaining to land, which in most cases turned out to be selfish,\" explains the chairman.\n\nIt was even more disadvantageous for women, who were not just disallowed from owning land but even from having their names appear on the land registry.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in Kenya, women run more than 75 per cent of its farms, yet currently, women registered in the titling systems in the country stand at just two percent.\n\n\"This is a challenge in the agriculture society. It also becomes a challenge because when you want to fund the women, they do not hold land titles,\" explains David Mwangi, a consultant on land governance and rural development.\n\nJackson Nkaiduri (right) community land manager and Christine Larpei (centre) at Musul in Laikipia County together with some community members in this photo taken on  March 13, 2024.\nPhoto credit: Richard Maosi | Nation Media Group\n\nIt is worse among the Maasai women. For years, the Maasai society has been characterised by gender disparities, with women often marginalised and denied equal rights, especially when it came to matters of property and land ownership.\n\n\"In the Maasai community, land is controlled by men, while women are the caretakers of homesteads,\" explains Lekeita Komoiyan an elder from Loita, Narok County.\n\nRead also: Owning land has offered me a taste of good life\n\nBut things are different with this law. For instance, Chief Ruso explains that with the transition, the community is allowed to have CLMC members, and according to the law, there must be gender parity, with women occupying more than five out of the 15 available seats.\n\nAs a result, more than half of the elected members of Musul's CLMC are women, including the committee treasurer.\n\n\"Initially, there was not a single woman in the land registry, but right now, women are fully involved in decision-making. Our Musul community land has almost 700 members, and women make up the largest percentage with 400,\" adds Jackson Nkaiduri, the community manager.\n\nBut it's not just about representation; women actually do own land here. \"From the over 2,500 acres of land owned by the Musul community, everyone above 18 years is entitled to get a parcel. This includes the elderly, the youth, persons with disabilities, and specifically women,\" adds Nkaiduri.\n\nMiriam Kenge, 25, is one of them. Apart from being a community member, she also owns a piece of land. \"Before then, this would have been impossible, especially for an unmarried woman like myself,\" she explains.\n\nThis has had a huge economic impact for some women landowners. \"Some have formed women's groups and set up cultural manyattas, which help them generate income through eco-tourism, and they use the money they get to pay school fees for their children,\" explains Chief Ruso.\n\nChristine Larpei of Musul in Laikipia County, also a landowner  who has already put her piece of land to work. \nPhoto credit: Richard Maosi | Nation Media Group\n\nChristine Larpei, also a community member and landowner thanks to this law, has already put her portion to work.\n\n\"I am currently practicing vegetable farming and also keeping some livestock, and this has become my source of income.\"\n\nWith this, she is certain that the land she owns is a ticket to a better life for her children because she can now send them to school without much worry.\n\nSome women from the area have also cultivated grazing grass, thus during the dry season, the cattle will have plenty to eat.\n\n\"This will minimise contact during the drought, thus reducing conflicts among communities,\" explains Nkaiduri.\n\nEven for the divorced Maasai women who were ostracised with nothing, the law came with massive relief. Like in many Maasai communities across Kenya, women in this Musul community were destined to live a life of poverty and cultural oppression, dependent on a husband.\n\n\"A Maasai woman was never allowed to divorce, except in the most egregious cases of physical abuse, and even if it came to that, the impact would be devastating on the woman. If there was a separation or divorce, women would lose their rights to the land, as cultural attitudes viewed women as their husband's property,\" explains Lekeita.\n\nBut with the transition, Chief Ruso says, even the divorced women now have the right to come back to their birthplace, apply for their names to be on the registry, and claim land.\n\nJustice Olalo says this has also been a boost to conflict resolution. \"Under the Community Act, conflicts within the community are to be solved through the alternative conflict resolution system.\"\n\n\"As a community, they use their cultural methods to talk about any challenges faced, and this has been very effective,\" he adds.\n\n\"This means that it has again made it safer for women and children, who have always carried the biggest brunt during conflicts arising from grazing land among the Maasai,\" explains Chief Ruso.\n\nIn a nutshell, experts agree that the land ownership transition has allowed for equal chances for both men and women to inherit and own family land, increased ability to undertake land projects, and the freedom to own their own livestock.\n\nBut other than just land ownership, this not only signifies progress but also represents the breaking down of traditional barriers that have excluded women from leadership roles.\n\n\"In our community, women in the Maasai community were considered just homemakers, and in some worst scenarios, they were seen as children; property to their husbands,\" says Lekeita.\n\nJanet Larpei a community member at Musul in Laikipia County.\nPhoto credit: Richard Maosi | Nation Media Group\n\nBut with this transition, what is certain is that some of the most patriarchal perceptions about women in this community are slowly being neutralised and becoming obsolete, and what is even more amazing, some of the most powerful men within the area are at the forefront of this.\n\nChief Ruso calls it a cultural revolution. According to him, the adoption of the Community Land Act in Musul has brought massive changes since women can now be heard and get leadership roles, particularly in the CMLC.\n\n\"Right from the beginning, we've seen men – even the elderly, whom you would think are still deeply influenced by Maasai traditions - coming out strongly to defend women's voices in our community, which is a big change.\"\n\nThis, he says, has led to inclusivity, especially in decision-making, and already the impact is being felt as the women of Musul take the lead, especially when it comes to land use. For the two women, Miriam and Christine, they hope that by setting an example through their own empowerment, they can inspire others in other communities across Kenya.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nPauline Ongaji", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4622954/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/fa05e35f8984215d48a1a9a2723abf65/bw/musul-1-.jpg", "image_description": "Jackson Nkaiduri, a community land manager at Musul in Laikipia County speaking to nation.africa.

Under the NHIF regime, the Linda Mama Program provided free antenatal, neonatal, and postnatal services to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\nHowever, its future is now uncertain since the creation of three healthcare funds: Primary Healthcare Fund, Social Health Insurance Fund, and the Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund.\n\nThe Senate bill focuses on three groups: pregnant women, newborns, and children up to 12 years of age. It also provides free prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal services. The proposed legislation even goes further to provide for referral to adoption services, training in feeding, and breastfeeding support services.\n\nIn an interview with nation.africa, the senator emphasised the necessity of providing every newborn with a fighting chance by ensuring adequate support during their crucial first month of life.\n\nShe referenced a recent Auditor General's report released in March, which found that 60 percent of the facilities examined lacked equipment necessary to offer basic maternity services.\n\n\"Kenya also has a high maternal mortality rate. For example, the Auditor General's report found that more than 1,000 women died between 2020 and 2021 despite substantial investments in maternal healthcare infrastructure. We must prioritise service quality to prevent avoidable maternal deaths.\"\n\nFurthermore, Beatrice mentioned that the bill, if passed, will provide tailored maternal healthcare for vulnerable groups, stating, \"Even mentally challenged and disabled pregnant women deserve services commensurate with their unique needs.\"\n\nFamily planning\n\nNominated Senator Crystal Asige, who seconded the bill upon its introduction to Parliament, also lauded its prioritising of pregnant women with special needs. Although she is championing the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Bill of 2023, Senator Asige highlights its limited coverage of women with disabilities in healthcare.\n\n\"I have seen cases on social media where women are not provided with proper beds during childbirth. Some are even forced to deliver on the floor or in overcrowded corridors,\" she stated. \"These stories emphasise the immediate necessity for dignified treatment of women and girls with disabilities.\"\n\nShe was referring to provisions in the bill that advocate for respectful attitudes towards pregnant women with disabilities, provision of pregnancy-related services, and referral of mental health problems, including alcohol and drug-related problems.\n\nIn an interview with nation.africa, Nelly Munyasia, the CEO of Reproductive Health Network (RHNK), commended the bill for specifically catering to pregnant adolescents, offering adolescent-friendly services for maternal healthcare if approved.\n\nShe has, however, raised concerns regarding the framing and language used in the bill, particularly regarding access to family planning services.\n\n\"I have reservations about the language used because 'family planning' traditionally implies planning for marriage or committed relationships,\" noted Nelly. \"This language may exclude single individuals who choose to have sexual relationships and children.\" She advocates for more inclusive language that acknowledges the reality of adolescent sexuality and the need for accessible reproductive health services.\n\nIf passed, The Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Bill of 2023 could provide specialised healthcare services for mothers and newborns, distinguishing it from previous approaches with its holistic perspective, a much-needed replacement for the now uncertain Linda Mama Program.\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nAgatha Gichana", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4619568/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/c238f9dc3210b91789bc6be85487163d/iR/linda-mama-pic.jpg", "image_description": "A woman attending an antenatal clinic.

{"title": " ", "content": "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua’s absence when President William Ruto hosted his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni is one of at least nine consecutive events that the second in command, who has been a fixture next to his boss in key functions, has missed.\n\nQuestions now linger on the whereabouts of Mr Gachagua, who has never shied away from speaking his mind in public forums.\n\nMr Gachagua’s last public appearance was on Sunday during a roadside engagement at Kagumo Market in Kirinyaga County, a day after he said he supports the one man-one vote-one shilling resource allocation formula.\n\n“This afternoon was a moment of sharing crucial gains in reforming the tea, coffee and dairy and other sub-sector reforms aimed at dignifying small-scale farmers,” said the DP about the Kagumo stopover, adding on his social media pages that reporting to the public on the progress of transforming the country by implementing the plan of Kenya Kwanza was part of his responsibilities.\n\nThere has been no public communication on Mr Gachagua’s whereabouts.\n\nThe Deputy President raised eyebrows on Friday last week when he failed to participate in the national tree planting exercise that involved the President, Cabinet secretaries and senior State officials.\n\nAlso Read: Limuru III: CS Moses Kuria takes on DP Gachagua\n\nThe DP had been scheduled to plant trees in Bomet County, but reportedly cancelled at the last minute, after an advance team from his office had arrived. Some sources pointed to a disagreement on the use of helicopters.\n\nAs has been the norm, the DP would have ideally accompanied his boss to Kiambicho Forest in Maragua, Murang’a County, to plant trees at the event in his backyard.\n\nThe President said the day was set aside by the Cabinet in honour of those who lost their lives as a result of the floods that ravaged various parts of the country.\n\nPet projects\n\nMr Gachagua was also missing from State House on Tuesday when President Ruto met with chairpersons and directors of key agencies where they agreed to effect the Tea Tribunal to deal with disputes among stakeholders. Reforms in tea, milk and coffee sectors are the DP’s pet projects, having been handed the responsibility by his boss.\n\nIn the absence of the DP, the President tasked Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service Felix Koskei to handle the matter. Mr Koskei took to social media platform X to announce that he had taken the responsibility to resolve the issues facing the sector.\n\n“Today (Wednesday), under the President’s direction, I convened a meeting focused on unlocking barriers affecting small-holder tea farmers,” he stated on X on Wednesday, listing the attendees, who included principal secretaries Paul Rono (Agriculture) and Patrick Kilemi (Cooperatives), and other stakeholders.\n\nAlso Read: 2027 jitters: Mt Kenya politicians grow impatient with Ruto government\n\nThe same day, Mr Gachagua, also tasked with coordinating international partnership engagements, missed a meeting with European Union (EU) diplomats on the signing of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) on trade, investment and regulation.\n\nHe was also missing during the swearing in of the new High court judges and conferment of the rank of senior counsel to advocates at State House Nairobi.\n\nLast weekend, the DP ignited a fierce debate on the one man-one vote-one shilling resource sharing proposal as he pushed for more resources for the populous Mt Kenya region.\n\nAlso Read: Anger, rip-offs and new taxes: Politics of farming and new Ruto, Gachagua headache\n\nHe made the remarks during the consecration of Bishop John Kimani Nthiga at the ACK Cathedral of St Peter Mbeere in Embu County, before he proceeded to address the public outside the church, where he repeated the proposal.\n\nThe DP and others had opposed the one-man-one-vote-one shilling proposal when then President Uhuru Kenyatta initiated it through the Third Basic Formula for sharing revenue with counties.\n\nAccording to insiders, the DP is believed to be in his home area in Mathira but is unavailable to those who have tried to reach him.\n\n“The DP has decided to go mute. People in government have been trying to reach him but his phone is switched off. We are not sure whether he is Mathira or Nairobi,” said a senior government official who declined to be named.\n\nA UDA senator also told the Nation that he unsuccessfully tried to reach Mr Gachagua on phone and even reached out to some of his close confidants without success.\n\nAlso Read: Rumble in the Mountain: Truth behind Rigathi vs Nyoro battle for Mt Kenya\n\n“It’s unusual for the DP to be unreachable. His phone is off,” said the second-term senator.\n\nThe DP’s absence was conspicuous when President Museveni landed at State House, with nearly eight Cabinet Secretaries waiting to receive him at the bilateral talks.\n\nWhen President Museveni jetted into the country on Wednesday evening, with Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi at hand to receive him at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.\n\nOn the same Wednesday, President Ruto presided over a recruits’ pass-out parade at the Kenya Defence Forces Recruits Training School in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County, a function that the DP also missed. Other leaders from Nyeri County were present at the event.\n\nHaving attended previous KDF pass-outs in other military schools alongside the Commander-in-Chief, Mr Gachagua’s absence at the ceremony that involved more than 4,000 recruits was loud.\n\nThe Nation sent a text message to Njeri Rugene, the head of the Deputy President’s Communication Service, enquiring on Mr Gachagua’s whereabouts, but she had not responded by the time of going to press. Our phone calls also went unanswered\n\nThe behind the scenes intrigues have not escaped some observers. Githunguri MP Gathoni Wamuchomba, in a satirical move, posted a picture on X on Wednesday of the President and his deputy on September 13, 2022 kneeling together with their spouses after the swearing at Kasarani stadium, with added clouds hanging over them.\n\nNo pictures or statements\n\nPresident Ruto left for Rwanda yesterday morning and no pictures or statements were released about his departure or who saw him off. It is customary for the DP and other senior government official to accompany the President to the airport.\n\nThe outspoken DP prides himself as the President’s blue-eyed boy, insisting that anyone who wants to access his boss must go through him.\n\nArticle 147 of the constitution on the functions of the DP states: “The Deputy President shall be the principal assistant of the President and shall deputise the President in the execution of the President’s functions.”\n\nIt adds: “The Deputy President shall perform the functions conferred by this Constitution and any other functions of the President as the President may assign.”\n\nAlso as per Article 134 of the constitution, when the President is absent or is temporarily incapacitated, and during any other period that the President decides, the DP shall act as the President.\n\nDespite the DP being the President’s principal assistant, he has been fighting many fires in government. Apart from MPs like MP Ndindi Nyoro whom he has called out publicly over his inroads in the Mountain, he also has Public Service Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria to contend with over the region’s kingpin debate.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nRoselyne Obala", "date": "Saturday, May 18, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4617528/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/5d8037cf12072ad4882de8d4a05e475f/Ir/gachagua-dp-1-.jpg", "image_description": "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.

{"title": "Hadzabe, the Tanzanian tribe where women call the shots", "content": "Tap! Tap! Tap! A brown antelope calf hops across a smooth graded Karatu-Mang'ola road in Oldeani, a cool area in northern Tanzania covered in maize, sunflower, beans and coffee plantations.\n\nPast Oldeani, it gets hot and windy. It's dusty too. As we get closer, we notice bushes, shrubs and indigenous trees scattered all over.  We are headed to meet the Hadzabe in the depths of forests of Yaeda Valley near Lake Eyasi in the Arusha region.\n\nThis hunter-gatherer community has also settled in Serengeti Plateau, on the side of Meatu District in the Simiyu region. The plateau borders Kenya. Others are spread across the forests of Mbulu and Kiteto districts in the Manyara region.\n\nA section of Sonai settlement on June 2, 2023.\n\nThe Hadzabe are among about 130 ethnic groups in Tanzania. They are known by different variations—Hadzabi, Hadzane, Hadzape, Hadzapi, Hatsa and Watindiga. In the Kilimanjaro region, for instance, they are known as Watindiga. In Mtwara, they call them Wazabi.\n\nThough Tanzania’s 2022 Census has not provided their population estimates, the United Nations says their numbers range from 1,300 to 1,500, a handful of the 61.7 million Tanzanians.\n\nEndeko Endeko, a member of this community, is helping us locate his people who have settled in the Melekaa area.\n\nThere are no roads or signage here to give a sense of direction.\n\nSlight change\n\nSome progress though, the Hadzabe now own mobile phones, which they buy with the money visitors donate to them, or from their beadwork proceeds. The phone signal is, however, poor here.\n\nA display of ornaments the Hadzabe sell to visitors at Sonai settlement, on June 2, 2023.\n\nWe access Melekaa from Mang’ola trading centre, a remote business area with only one hotel and a few shops. After diverting onto a bumpy road described as “hiyo barabara ya kwenda kwa wa Hadzabe (that road leading to the Hadzabe),” we manoeuvre through the rocks and shrubs.\n\nWe finally arrive at the foot of a huge baobab tree with a cave on its trunk. Before it, is a dusty open field surrounded by more baobabs and shrubs. On the right is a hillock of intimidating boulders resting on each other, forming a somewhat fortification for the community.\n\nShortly, a man in shorts and a brown sleeveless shirt walks down. Over his shoulder is a beaded skin. His foot is covered with grey tyre sandals and a knife is strapped to his shorts. He holds an arrow. This is Mambosi Jioja, the chairperson of the Sonai Hadzabe group.\n\nThe Hadzabe are communal, have a nomadic lifestyle and depend on game meat and wild fruits. For the last 30 years, however, they have never moved from here, Mambosi says. They live behind the hillock. Mambosi leads us up.\n\nMambosi Jioja inside a cave under a baobab tree trunk on June 2, 2023. He is the chairperson of the Hadzabe group.\n\nAs we crawl up, my heart freezes. A slide backward means an early visit to my ancestors. Furthermore, background research informed me that tiger and bark snakes are common here. I wonder if some are lurking under the rocks.\n\nMambosi is agile. I can't keep up with him. For a few seconds, I stand to catch a breath amid a whiff of nutty-burnt tyre air.\n\nI ask him if a snake has stung anyone in the recent past. His response in the negative is consoling. He says they only bite if provoked. The Hadzabe don't eat snakes as many presume, Mambosi says.\n\nWe finally arrive in Sonai, where about 180 Hadzabe have settled in 35 brandy dome huts.\n\nOn a log under a towering baobab tree are men crafting sticks with knives to make arrows. A few yards behind them are women sitting on the ground watching over their merchandise lined up on makeshift display structures under the baobab tree.\n\nNecklaces, bangles, earrings, headbands and ornamental gourds hang from the branches and hangers made from cactus, fixed on the tree. I later discover that this baobab tree, in the middle of the settlement, is a landmark serving as a special meeting point for the community.\n\nI greet the men: “Hamjambo? (How are you?).”\n\nI receive a rude response; they just smile and continue sharpening their arrows.\n\nAlthough this community mainly speaks their native language Hadzabe, their Swahili is fluent. So they heard me. But apparently, I have broken their greeting code.\n\nMambosi shows me what I am expected to do. Their greeting is special. I shake their hand and say 'mtana' for hello. But the mtana is escorted with some kind of Maasai dance in the form of a rhythmic combination of sounds of kissing, clicking and mumbling like mwaah, knah, mmm, mtana!\n\nHaving mastered the art, it becomes easier to greet the women. I request to speak with the women and Katarina Hassan quickly takes the wings.\n\nShe welcomes me to her low-height hut built from branches and leaves of indigenous trees. It’s also covered with cream tarpaulin, white sack and canvas, materials left behind by visitors. It has no window—only a door of a coloured shawl.We sit down on a hide of a buffalo, covered with a coloured leso.\n\n“What are the roles of a man and woman in your community?” I ask her.\n\n“His work is to hunt and bring home honey for the family,” she explains. “A woman is to dig up roots and tubers and collect wild fruits.”\n\nThe environment has open patches, a clear sign of lost flora to accommodate fauna, their source of livelihood. The changing times has, however, not shifted the community’s expectations as is the case for modern society where women assume roles previously restricted to men.\n\n“Our roles still stand. I can’t go hunting. Neither can he go collecting fruits or tubers; that is my work. That is how it is. That’s a culture passed down to us,” she reckons.\n\nKatarina Hassan digs out a tuber on June 2, 2023.\n\nThey have, however, defied the kind of food they eat. She says the harsh weather conditions and conversion of parts of the forest to farms have disturbed the area's ecology, resulting in dwindled production and presence of their wild food.The wild animals they hunted—antelopes, wildebeests, baboons, dik-dik, buffaloes and zebras—have gone missing.\n\nSpecial status\n\nAccording to the UN, the Hadzabe are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer communities on Earth. In Tanzania, it is the only community allowed to source its food through hunting and gathering, says Zakaria Faustin, executive director of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum.\n\nHe says Tanzania’s first President Mwalimu Nyerere issued a decree recognising and protecting the community’s special status. The order stands, he says.\n\nBut the changing ecosystem threatens their special status. “Whenever they (animals) want to come here, they hear meee, mooo, owh, ting, ting and they run away,” Maliseli Sadiki, a young man who says he is 22, illustrates their frustration with the disappearance of the wild animals.\n\n“These days, you walk for long until you get tired and hunger pangs and thirst overwhelm you. So, you’re forced to excavate tubers to eat. They are succulent and quench your thirst,” says Maliseli, whose dressing is like a billboard of the animals they hunt.\n\nKatarina Hassan holds a tuber on June 2, 2023.\n\nHanging over his faded black T-shirt and blue knee denim short, are skins and hides of antelope, wildebeest, baboons, dik-dik, buffalo and zebra.\n\nThe community has embraced other food. “We eat rice and ugali with vegetables,” says Katarina.\n\n“Usually, visitors bring us maize flour, rice, indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and cooking oil. If anyone gifts us with money, we use it to buy food and distribute it among ourselves.”\n\nTogetherness\n\nHere, nearly everything is done communally. It is the community chairperson who receives any gift on their behalf, including money and food, then he shares it out.\n\nIf it’s food, it has to be adequate enough to feed all of them. If it’s water, sourced from a borehole miles away, the money ought to be enough to buy at least one jerrycan of 20 litres for each household at Tsh1,000 (Ksh57.58).\n\nTrue to Katarina’s submission, during my short time with the community, some foreign tourists gift them with maize flour, assorted indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and some money to buy cooking oil. Mambosi leads the distribution from the baobab tree, the special meeting point.\n\nThe women stretch their hands to receive the food. But there is something unique about this whole exercise.\n\nI have witnessed food distribution exercises in Kenya’s Turkana, Baringo and Narok counties and I have never seen a man run to the house to bring a sack to the wife to collect the food. Maybe, I have not been that keen.\n\nGender power balance is so obvious here. In a generation where UN Women keeps calling for redistribution of household responsibilities, how this community does it is intriguing.\n\nI ask Katarina about the power relations between men and women in their community. “Sisi ni wakali sana kwa wanaume. Sisi ndio tuna uamuzi. Uamuzi ndio wa kwetu. Tukiamua hii, sisi wanawake tumeamua, tusipoamua basi tunaacha (We are more powerful than men. We are the decision-makers and when we decide, our decision is final),” she says.\n\nThe power is rooted in marriage culture. Unlike in most cultures across the world where a woman moves into the man’s home once they marry, here, it is the opposite.\n\n“Well, a man woos the woman but she only marries him if he accepts her terms and conditions,” explains Katarina.\n\n“Once he accepts, she builds her house with the support of her mother and other women. The man then joins her. It is her house. Not the man’s,” she says.\n\nThe women also determine how much should be paid as reverse dowry. Years ago, they had to bring not less than three baboons, rolls of tobacco and honey, Katarina says.\n\nA section of Sonai settlement.\n\nBut these days, due to scarcity of the wild animals, they are allowed to pay in many necklaces, as preferred by the women, and honey.\n\n“The young man will make efforts to find honey, tobacco and necklaces,” explains Mambosi, the Sonai settlement’s chairperson. “The bride’s mother and sister to the groom will only welcome them into the house after the man has fulfilled all the dowry requirements.”\n\nWhile the women help the bride to construct the house for the incoming husband, the men prepare the groom for his household responsibilities by giving him a honey bag, a skin or hide, knife and arrows, Mambosi says.\n\nSo in the case of divorce, the man only leaves with what he came with. That is his only possession. “The children belong to the women. They may have his surname, but it is the women who call the shots,” insists Katarina.\n\nApalii Saitoti Thufu, Katarina’s husband, proudly acknowledges the power of women here. “If she tells you to leave, you’ll leave. If she allows you to leave with the children then fine,” he says.\n\nIn jest, I interject: “But you can refuse to leave.”\n\nHe quickly counters: “How can you refuse to go, yet the house is hers. Even if you were to go with the children, where would you host them when you don’t have a house?”\n\n“Is there a problem building a house for yourself and the children?” I ask.\n\nHe responds: “No, no! It’s not in our tradition for a man to build a house. That’s the work of women. If she chases you away, you return to your parents. And you’ll just sleep in the open or create some sort of a structure to sleep under.”\n\nApalii says he was born in Ghorofani, another settlement in Karatu District and moved to Sonai where his wife built a house. Together, they have two children.\n\nI ask Katarina the main reason why women chase away the men and she says: “Kama nimechoka kuchimba mizizi si nitakuwa mkali? (How can I not be rattled if I am bogged down with excavating roots?)”\n\nMaliseli is a victim. He was born here but had a wife in Endamaka, another settlement in Karatu district. They had two children.\n\nBut he says he recently returned to his parents, after disagreeing with his wife. She remained with the children. He says he hasn’t seen the children since he left, but given the chance, he can visit them.\n\nHe struggled to respond to the query of where he lives. “Mimi naishi kama mimi, kama mimi, kama mimi (As for me, I, I, I live).”\n\nUnlike in many parts of Tanzania and Kenya, where female genital mutilation and child marriages are prevalent, among the Hadzabe, such harmful practices are zero. They are detested. However, girls go through a rite of passage.\n\nA Hadzabe. Girls wear headbands once they begin menstruating.\n\n“If a girl taints her clothes, we will know she has started her menses,” explains Mindi Saitoti, “or if she doesn’t know what’s happening, she will ask her mother.\"\n\n\"The same day she makes the report, the women contribute beaded necklaces and a headband to decorate her. That shows she is mature.\n\n\"But it doesn’t mean she is ready for marriage. If a man intends to marry her, her mother must approve of it and they never do so unless she is above 18 years,” she says.\n\nMindi is married and has three children. She and her husband, Tabashi Chalesi, were born here. She built a house a few yards away from her parents’ and they live happily.\n\nI am curious to find out if Tabashi finds it strange to live near his in-laws. But it sounds like a weird question.“Strange, how?” he asks.\n\n“We are okay. What is the problem with that?”\n\nI rest my case. Meanwhile, the men have their own way of telling when a woman is ready for marriage.\n\n“You look at the chest. If the breasts are sagging and she has a necklace, you will know she is suitable for marriage,” says Mambosi.\n\nEducation\n\nAlthough the Tanzanian government has made efforts to take its children to school, the Hadzabe who get an education still return to the forest to continue with their cultural lifestyle.\n\nThe case of Endeko. He got his secondary education in 2015 and later a diploma in governance and development through a scholarship.\n\nBut currently, he lives in his home in Yaeda Chini in Mbulu District in the Manyara region. He says forest life is less stressful.\n\nZakaria of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum describes the process of modernising the Hadzabe as complicated.“You help them get higher education but they still prefer to go back to the forests,” he notes.\n\nHis organisation has previously attempted to help them embrace sustainable means of livelihood but it ended in futility.\n\n“In 2007, we supported them with goats so that they can shift from hunting to keeping goats. But during the dry season, they returned home, shot the goats and ate them,” he says.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nMoraa Obiria", "date": "Saturday, July 15, 2023", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4302480/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/d8900c0364c0fed9c738a8c34de37f29/CV/mf1.jpg", "image_description": "Katarina Hassan with her husband Apalii Saitoti Thufu at the foot of a baobab tree at Sonai settlement within the Yaeda valley in Karatu district, Arusha region, on June 2, 2023.\nPhoto credit: Photos I Moraa Obiria", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2023-07-15T12:14:25Z"}
{"title": "Marital rape: Day women refused to suffer in silence", "content": "In 2019, Roselyne Belinda Achieng’ walked out of her marriage after living with her husband for only four years. She was 22 years old.\n\nThis is not what the now 26-year-old envisioned when she met her husband a couple of years ago in church. The two later got married.\n\nMs Achieng’ had enrolled at Kenya Institute of Mass Communication for a Broadcast Journalism course in 2014, but dropped out for lack of funds.\n\nAll seemed rosy until one evening when she had just come home, having been discharged from hospital after delivering their second child.\n\nA few hours in, her husband demanded that they get intimate, a request she turned down as she was still nursing some wounds and was also tired.\n\nAlso Read: Meet the male champions saying no to GBV, saving victims\n\nHe would hear none of it. “I just felt him on top of me and had his way with me,” says Ms Achieng’.\n\nOn several occasions in the past, he had forced himself on her claiming it was his conjugal right.\n\nMs Achieng’ invited her husband’s brother to discuss the issue, but this did not help.\n\n“On the following day, his brother said it was something they did to wives, and perfectly normal,” says Ms Achieng’ who adds, however, that as far as she was concerned, her husband raped her.\n\nNevertheless, she chose to stay; her children needed a present father while the last born was also only days old.\n\nThe violence did not, however, stop, and though she wished to share her ordeal with friends, she knew not how to start.\n\nHer next option was to seek help from the church, because this was where it had all begun.\n\nThe spiritual leaders advises the couple to resolve their issue amicably. What pained Ms Achieng’, however, is that no one spoke about the fact that she had been raped severally by the person she trusted most.\n\nShe felt like the church was siding with the husband instead of solving the real issue.\n\nOne day, her husband turned violent and she screamed, attracting neighbours to her rescue.\n\nAlso Read: Here’s how to identify a violent partner\n\nEvents of the day left her husband ashamed while the bond between them grew weaker with each passing day.\n\nEventually, she walked out of the marriage. Her last-born son was already a year old as she moved in with her parents in Manyatta, Kisumu County, trying to figure out her next move.\n\n“One time, I came across women huddled in a group speaking about rape in their marriages. While I did not join in, I realised I was not alone. There were more silent sufferers in matrimonial homes,” says Ms Achieng’.\n\nRoselyne Belinda Achieng', a survivor of intimate partner violence .\nPhoto credit: Photo | Pool\n\nShe adds: “That is why I later decided to speak up. There are women across the world who have gone through similar experiences but afraid to speak up.”\n\nShe then made it habit to share her story of abuse with other women in the slums hoping she could help them open up and share their struggle.\n\nTogether with a group of friends, Ms Achieng’ would counsel the women who approached them.

{"title": "Iran launches retaliatory attack on Israel with hundreds of drones, missiles", "content": "Jerusalem,\n\nIran launched a swarm of explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel late on Saturday in its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, risking a major escalation as the United States pledged \"ironclad\" backing for Israel.\n\nSirens wailed and Reuters journalists in Israel said they heard distant heavy thuds and bangs from what local media called aerial interceptions of explosive drones. Authorities said a 7-year-old girl was critically injured.\n\nIsrael's military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Iran launched dozens of ground-to-ground missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted outside Israeli borders. They included more than 10 cruise missiles, he said.\n\nThe Iranian salvo amounted to more than 200 drones and missiles so far, Hagari said, and had caused light damage to one Israeli military facility.\n\nThe Israeli military said later that it was not advising any residents to prepare to take shelter, revising an earlier alert in what appeared to signal the end of the threat.\n\nIsrael's Channel 12 TV cited an unnamed Israeli official as saying there would be a \"significant response\" to the attack.\n\nIran had vowed retaliation for what it called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on April 1 that killed seven Guards officers including two senior commanders and said its strike was a punishment for \"Israeli crimes\". Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the consulate attack.\n\n\"Should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe,\" the Iranian mission to the United Nations said, warning the U.S. to \"stay away\".

Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden joined Slovakia's EU partners in expressing shock and condemnation of the shooting.\n\nThe country of 5.4 million has seen polarised political debate in recent years, including the hard-fought presidential election last month that helped tighten Fico's grip on power.\n\nSince returning as prime minister last October, Fico has shifted policy quickly. Opposition critics call it a power grab.\n\nHis government has scaled back support for Ukraine while opening dialogue with Russia sought to weaken punishments for corruption dismantled a special prosecutor's office, and is revamping the RTVS public broadcaster despite calls to protect media freedom.\n\nFico has long been critical of Slovakia's mainstream media, refusing to speak to some outlets. Members of his party blasted media and opposition actions in recent months.\n\n\"I ask all to stop piling attacks, expressions of hate, on social networks, in the media, which are aimed at that or another political camp, regardless if it concerns the (government) coalition or the opposition,\" Sutaj Estok said.\n\nGovernment meeting\n\nAfter the attack, Fico was rushed to hospital in Handlova where he had been chairing a government meeting. He was then transported by helicopter to regional capital Banska Bystrica for urgent treatment, it said, adding that his condition was too serious for him to be taken to Bratislava.\n\nA Reuters witness heard shots as Fico exited a building to shake hands with a crowd of people who had been waiting to greet him. Police then wrestled a man to the ground.\n\nSlovak news media reported the shooter was a former security guard at a shopping mall, an author of three collections of poetry and a member of the Slovak Society of Writers.

I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.\"\n\nBiden offered U.S. help to Slovakia, saying in a statement: \"We condemn this horrific act of violence.\"\n\nSlovakia's biggest opposition party Progressive Slovakia called off a planned protest and called for restraint to avoid escalating tensions. Parliament suspended debate indefinitely after the attack.\n\nIn his career, Fico has moved between the pro-European mainstream and nationalistic positions opposed to EU and U.S. policies. He has also shown a willingness to change course depending on public opinion or changed political realities.\n\nAn admirer of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Fico has grown increasingly critical of Western support for Ukraine in its war with invading Russian forces.\n\nFico was forced to resign as premier amid mass protests in 2018 triggered by the contract killing of Jan Kuciak, a journalist who had been investigating high-level corruption.

{"title": " ", "content": "The national government has upgraded the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) in Kisumu to a Level 6 facility.\n\nLocals in Kisumu commonly refer to it as 'Russia Hospital', a name coined because of the good relations between Kenya and the Russian government.\n\nThe JOOTRH is one of the oldest health facilities in the country, serving thousands of patients in the Western region.\n\nThe hospital is located along the Kakamega-Kisumu Highway just before Kondele Police Station on a 55.6 acre land.\n\nThe elevation comes after a recent evaluation and inspection conducted by the Kenya Health Professional Oversight Authority (KHPOA).\n\nKisumu County Government had initially requested the national government to take over the running of the facility due to financial constraints.\n\nAccording to the JOOTRH administration, the health oversight body awarded the facility a score of 85 per cent after a recent inspection on August 1, 2023.\n\nBut what does the upgrading of the public hospital to a Level 6 facility means to local residents?\n\nFor starters, with the Ministry of Health taking over the facility, it shall be on the same level with Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), and Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital (KUTRH) which are run by the national government.\n\n\n\nFunds\n\nAnother advantage the facility is bound to have is the unlocking of funds especially from the national government and other partners, therefore enhancing the quality of services offered to residents.\n\nCurrently, 70 per cent of the hospital's resources come from the county government.\n\nThe regional referral hospital is serving patients drawn from 10 counties within the Lake Region Economic Bloc.\n\nThis has however been a thorn in the flesh of Governor Anyang' Nyong’o's administration since it had to run the Level 5 facility at its own operation cost.\n\n\n\nSurgeries and procedures\n\nAccording to the County Chief Executive Committee Member of Health Dr Gregory Ganda, the upgrading of JOOTRH means that the facility will now be equipped with both professional personnel and medical equipment to conduct high-level surgeries and save residents the agony of having to travel far to undergo such medical procedures.\n\nCurrently, the facility has 11 functional operational theatres, including general, Accident & Emergency, and three dedicated maternity theatres.\n\n\n\nService Delivery\n\nThe upgrade is expected to improve medical service delivery. For instance, the creation of consultation rooms to promote patients' privacy.\n\nWith sufficient funding, the facility can procure essential pharmaceutical products to improve access to quality care.\n\nThe hospital plans to erect relevant signage in respective service areas to ease the flow of service provision to patients.\n\nJOOTRH has a 13-bed ICU with operational patient monitors.\n\n\n\nCancer\n\nAlready the county government had started the construction of a cancer centre. But with financial challenges the project stalled.\n\nWith these hitches, Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Susan Nakhumicha pledged Sh100 million to complete the construction of the cancer centre.\n\nIf completed, the cancer centre will ultimately reduce the need for patients to travel long distances for cancer treatment.\n\nCelestine Agutu, a resident of Kisumu said that it will be a relief for cancer patients and those with chronic illnesses who currently seek services in Eldoret and Nairobi.\n\n“When the resources are available for the public facility, then there will be enough budget allocation and equipment to take care of the needs of the residents,” said Ms Agutu.\n\nPresently, the regional referral hospital offers oncology services for both adults and children.\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe health oversight authority pointed out that the facility needed to improve waste management within the hospital, increase the number of staff and streamline its emergency preparedness and outpatient department.\n\nThe authority also proposed that JOOTRH expand the Emergency and Accident department to accommodate more patients.\n\nPreviously the facility has been on the receiving end with complaints of drug shortage, blood and generally slow service delivery.\n\nKevin Otieno, a resident of Kisumu suggests that the national government employs more health workers at the facility to manage the increasing number of patients seeking medical attention.\n\n“The hospital needs to recruit additional staff, including critical care nurses, general nurses, medical officers, specialists and medical officer interns. This may necessitate increased budgetary allocations to support the growing workload,” said Mr Otieno.\n\nJOOTRH currently acts as a training ground for medical students from Maseno and Uzima universities.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the facility, CS Nakhumicha applauded Governor Nyong'o's administration for surrendering the management of JOOTRH to the national government and castigated some county governments that have clung to similar big health facilities, under the guise of generating on-source revenue at the expense of poor service delivery.\n\n“This is not good thinking because it has an effect on service delivery. Our people need quality health services closer to them and we must have a discussion on how to run these facilities and even the sharing of revenue,” she said.\n\n[email protected]\n\n\n\n", "author": "By \nElizabeth Ojina", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4623714/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/1d9f0d8fa41ff57000ccf2ae3fc28597/lq/russia-hospital.jpg", "image_description": "Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu.  Photo credit: Ondari Ogega| Nation", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-15T12:47:21Z"}
{"title": "Why ‘men only’ clubs shouldn't exist in this age", "content": "On a visit to a neighbouring country last year, I was invited by a colleague to a men-only club, also known as a gentlemen’s club. It’s an exclusive space where wealthy and influential men gather for socialising, dining, and networking. I was taken aback when I learned about the existence of such clubs. From my perspective, putting on a lens of gender equality, it seemed like an antiquated concept perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nThese clubs (physical structures, not merry-go-rounds) have existed since the colonial period, with strict membership criteria based on factors like social status, profession, or personal connections – fostering an “old boys’ club” mentality that has historically excluded women from important social and professional spheres.\n\nWhile the rules of this particular club have been relaxed to allow women entry if invited by a member, the core premise of a men-only space seemed inherently discriminatory to me.\n\nThose accompanying me, including some colleagues from Nairobi, saw nothing wrong with the concept, citing the right to freedom of association. They argued that these clubs serve as private sanctuaries for men to engage in certain activities or discussions without the presence of women. Some even claimed there are women-only clubs of a similar calibre, though I’m not aware of any. The women in my circles who belong to such clubs in Kenya are members in clubs that admit all genders.\n\nHowever, I firmly believe such exclusive clubs have no place in the modern age. They fuel unhelpful polarisation between genders and are relics of a bygone era steeped in patriarchal norms that society should actively dismantle.\n\nWhile progress has been made, the stark reality is that gender equality remains an elusive goal globally. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2023, it will take another 131 years to close the existing chasm at the current rate.\n\nThe persistence of such blatantly discriminatory institutions is a sobering reminder of how deeply entrenched gender biases still are in our societies. Despite the strides made towards greater equality, subtle and overt forms of sexism continue to pervade various spheres, hindering the full participation and advancement of women. Men-only clubs reinforce the notion of male dominance and superiority.\n\nSocial justice\n\nDismantling these age-old power structures is not only a matter of social justice but also an economic imperative. Study after study has shown that greater gender diversity in leadership and decision-making roles leads to better outcomes, enhanced innovation, and increased profitability for organisations and nations.\n\nAchieving true gender parity requires a concerted, sustained effort across all sectors of society.\n\nGender mainstreaming – the integration of a gender perspective into every stage of policy processes – is a crucial step in this journey. By promoting gender-responsive policies, programmes, and communication strategies, we can begin to dismantle deeply entrenched biases and create more equitable systems that benefit everyone.\n\nThis is why the gender mainstreaming training I attended last week, organised by the Aga Khan University Graduate School of Media and Communications, was so vital. Participants from diverse backgrounds gathered to learn how to effectively train, mentor, and support others in adopting gender-responsive approaches within their respective fields. Such initiatives are instrumental in fostering a more inclusive, prosperous society for all.\n\nWhile the path ahead is long, we must continue chipping away at patriarchal structures that curtail human potential based on gender. If the recent victories are any indication, there is reason for hope.\n\nBit by bit, we can pave the way for future generations to inherit a more equitable world – one where gender is no longer a barrier to anyone’s dreams and ambitions.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nDorcas Muga-Odumbe", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4628158/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/750fd197fc7e7b113e552cc47bc40b7e/PJ/men-only-pic.jpg", "image_description": "Men only clubs have existed since the colonial period, with strict membership criteria based on factors like social status, profession, or personal connections – fostering an “old boys’ club” mentality.\nPhoto credit: Photo | Pool", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-20T02:00:00Z"}
{"title": " ", "content": "When Dr Karambu Ringera fell out with the father of her son, she went through a traumatic experience that inspired her current work with orphans and survivors of violence.\n\nDr Karambu, a communication expert, is the founder of International Peace Initiatives (IPI) that runs Kithoka Amani Children’s Home and Tiriji Foundation that have become a haven for HIV/Aids orphans and victims of domestic and sexual violence.\n\n“I was not ready to be married to him and we agreed to share care time for our son. But when he took the boy for the first time, they hid him from me and refused to tell me where he was. I found my son after two years of searching. I managed to see him through a court order but they hid him again for 17 years. I got him back after the father passed on. I think this experience inspired me into the work I do,” Dr Karambu recounts.\n\nToday, Dr Karambu takes care of more than 100 orphans and vulnerable children having started out in 2002 with those orphaned and abandoned due to HIV/Aids.\n\nShe says women and children are the most hit when there is violence, poverty and disease which advised the formation of International Peace Initiatives.\n\n“Out of my experience, I discovered that women suffer most because we live under a patriarchal system. I decided to work with disadvantaged women and children to overcome the systems that were largely made by men to favour men,” she explains.\n\nDr Karambu says when HIV/Aids was at its peak in early 2000, women whose husbands succumbed to the disease faced psychological and physical violence with their children being abused.\n\nHowever, she says currently, most of those who seek shelter from IPI are victims of sexual and gender violence.\n\n“Our approach at IPI is transforming the victims through training and mentorship into self-reliant individuals. We work with victims to identify the solution to their problems because such an approach is more sustainable,” she says.\n\nAbandoned\n\nIn 2002, while a student in the US, Dr Karambu started working with a group of HIV positive women who made jewellery for sale.\n\n“Most of these women had been neglected and abandoned by relatives due to stigma. Some of them were opting to commit suicide. I could fund-raise to support their jewellery, enabling them to eat well and educate their children. Out of the 95 women we started with, only three have passed on,” Dr Karambu says.\n\nShe says Kithoka Amani Children’s Home, provides a safe place for victims of violence besides helping them start life afresh to be self-reliant.\n\nThe home, she says, provides vocational skills including agriculture, catering, hairdressing, tailoring, soap making among others besides offering scholarships through university.\n\n“Despite their past experiences, we train the children to believe in themselves and become leaders in their community.

{"title": "Trump lawyer questions Stormy Daniels' account of sex with Donald Trump", "content": "New York,\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer sought to show inconsistencies in porn star Stormy Daniels' various tellings of a 2006 sexual encounter she has said she had with Trump, part of an effort on Thursday to undermine her credibility as a witness in the first criminal trial of a sitting or former US president.\n\nHer unflattering account of a sexual encounter with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite while he was married to his wife Melania riveted jurors on Tuesday and reminded US voters of some of the more lurid aspects of his 2017-2021 presidency as he campaigns to win back the White House this year.\n\nFacing questioning on Thursday by defense lawyer Susan Necheles in a Manhattan courtroom, Daniels stuck to her account.\n\n\"You're trying to make me say that it changed, but it hasn't changed,\" Daniels told Necheles.\n\nTrump, 77, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels, 45, for her silence ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election about the alleged encounter. Trump has denied ever having sex with Daniels.\n\nTrump, the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 5 US election, has called the trial a politically motivated attempt to undermine his campaign.\n\nProsecutors have said Trump's efforts to obscure the paper trail for the payment to Daniels corrupted the 2016 election in which he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by preventing voters from learning about a story that might have swayed their vote.\n\nAfter testimony ended on Thursday, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche once again asked Justice Juan Merchan to declare a mistrial on the basis of Daniels' testimony.\n\nBlanche argued that her detailed testimony about the alleged sexual encounter, including her statement that Trump was not wearing a condom, had veered into territory that was irrelevant to the case and would prejudice jurors against Trump.\n\n\"This is not a case about sex,\" Blanche said. \"This is not a case about whether that incident took place or didn't take place.\"\n\nMerchan denied the request, saying that because Blanche had argued in his opening statement on April 22 that the encounter never happened prosecutors were allowed to try to rehabilitate Daniels' credibility.\n\n\"Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe,\" Merchan said.\n\nThe judge also denied a similar request on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition, Blanche requested that a gag order restricting Trump's public comments about jurors and witnesses be loosened to let the defendant publicly respond to questions about Daniels' testimony. Merchan also denied that request, stating that other witnesses may see Trump's comments and become concerned that he would say similar things about them.\n\nChristopher Conroy, a prosecutor, suggested that the proper way for Trump to respond to Daniels would be to testify in his own defense. Trump before the trial told reporters he would testify, though it remains to be seen whether he will do so.\n\n\"There is a proceeding here that this (gag) order is designed to protect,\" Conroy said. \"If somebody wants to respond to something that's said in this room, that can happen in this room.\"\n\nThe judge has fined Trump $10,000 for running afoul of the gag order 10 times, and said further violations could land him in jail.\n\n\n\nDefense says Daniels 'made all this up'\n\nIn nearly four hours of cross-examination on Tuesday and Thursday, Necheles asked Daniels about her earlier testimony of the alleged encounter compared with versions in a book she wrote and interviews she gave over the years.\n\nShe asked Daniels why in a 2018 interview to Vogue magazine she did not mention that Trump's bodyguard had been outside the hotel room where the encounter happened. Daniels on Tuesday had testified that her awareness of the bodyguard's presence contributed to a power imbalance with Trump that left her feeling uncomfortable.\n\n\"You made all this up, right?\" Necheles asked Daniels at one point.\n\n\"No,\" Daniels said emphatically, sitting with her hands folded and legs crossed.\n\nJust before ending the cross-examination, Necheles asked Daniels if she had knowledge of Trump's business records - part of an effort to paint her testimony as irrelevant to the false business records charges at hand.\n\n\"I know nothing about his business records, no,\" Daniels said. \"Why would I?\"\n\nDaniels completed her testimony, with a combined seven hours on the witness stand over two days.\n\nFormer Trump White House aide Madeline Westerhout took the witness stand on Thursday afternoon and told jurors about checks he signed while in office. Westerhout is expected to return to the witness stand on Friday.\n\nThis is the first of four criminal cases against Trump to go to trial.

I do not regret taking the offer,” says Ms Njoki.\n\nThe company named her the hostess of the year 2020. One of her main challenges is dealing with different types of customers, which she says can be overwhelming.\n\nMs Carol Nduko, on the other hand, is in charge of sales, marketing and customer relations department. A holder of higher diploma in sales and marketing, she says her job involves looking into the welfare of customers.\n\nAs a team leader, Ms Nduko handles complaints or compliments arising from the passengers using their vehicles.\n\n“My work is to create a long-lasting relationship between the customer and the company by ensuring they get quality service. I even keep their contacts to follow up on them to know their journey experience,” she says.\n\nMs Ann Grace Wanjiku is a driver who criss-crosses the country ferrying passengers to different regions. The 27-year-old is a certified driver with more than five years’ experience.\n\nIn her fourth year working with the shuttle company, Ms Wanjiku says the experience has been thrilling, especially considering that she is among the few female drivers.\n\nNegative attitude\n\nShe notes that doing a job that is dominated by men has not been all rosy as she has had to deal with negative attitude from some men who despise her.\n\n\"What keeps me going is my love for the job and the appreciation I get from the passengers at the end of the journey. Most of them congratulate me, including those who had issues at the start of the journey,” she says.\n\nAfter operating for a decade, the company recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. For the second consecutive year, they were awarded for being the best fleet shuttle of the year.\n\nThey received a trophy last month in a colourful ceremony hosted by the road safety agency, Safety Plus Consulting Limited formerly the National Road Safety Agency.\n\nSpeaking during the celebration, Mr Alphayo Otuke, the Chief Executive Officer of Safety Plus Limited said the Prestige Shuttle has proved to be an important stakeholder in the government’s efforts to promote safety on the highways.\n\nHe said the agency considered many parameters ranging from the manner of operations, company innovations systems such as the Information Communication Technology that enable efficiency and accident ratings among other things, before settling on the winner.\n\n“We need to see all stakeholders play their part in promoting road safety in order to reduce the worrying surge in number accidents along our roads,” said Mr Otuke.\n\nPrestige Shuttle director Mr Steven Muli and his wife cut the cake to mark 10 years of operation. \nPhoto credit: Joseph Openda | Nation Media Group\n\nWhile receiving the award, the company director Mr Steve Muli, who is also the chairman of the Central Rift Matatu Owners Association, said his aim is to change the traditional perception of the industry by offering decent services.\n\n“We promise to maintain our quality standards to be emulated by other stakeholders in the industry. As we begin our second decade, our aim will be to see the matatu industry respected as any other serious business,” said Mr Muli.\n\nThe company has invested heavily on customer relations with their focus on the female employees.\n\nMs Chebet, a regular customer with the service says she has used the shuttles for four years now.\n\n“I live in Baringo County but work in Nairobi, so I travel every weekend sometimes with my family, and I have been using the shuttles. I love the services because I do not need to worry about careless driving,” she says.\n\nMr Muli says he initially employed men before changing the strategy after four years of poor business. The director says the decision to have women in the crew turned out to be his golden opportunity as business blossomed very fast.\n\n“We were shocked when the high number of customers overwhelmed our staff.

{"title": "Why disaster studies are wrong on gender coverage", "content": "Official data on the current flooding disaster shows that at least 257 people have died, with 188 injured and 54,837 households displaced.\n\nA total of 293, 661 people are reported to be affected. This devastating situation requires collaborative mobilisation of resources and their prudent use to put affected citizens back on their feet. As this happens, it is important to note that disasters have gender-differentiated impacts.\n\nThe 2019 UN Women and Unicef study titled Gender and age inequality of disaster risk attempts to expose the nexus between gender and disaster risk based on the cases of Nepal, Malawi and Dominica.\n\nRead: Women, children take the brunt of floods in El Nino-ravaged counties\n\nIt decries the lack of disaggregated quantitative data to enable a meaningful understanding of the impact to inform gender-responsive action. It thus recommends a six-step model to generate such data.\n\nStep one regards collation of available quantitative data, disaggregated by age and sex, or estimation of the numbers affected. Step two focuses on qualitative studies for insights into the differentiated challenges and needs. Step three is about examining evidence of inequality in a given context and factors that make certain groups more vulnerable.\n\nStep four regards a critical analysis of the data to unveil the gender-related determinants of vulnerability. Step five proposes partnership with entities having the expertise to support minority groups. Step six suggests deliberate attention to the experiences of marginalised individuals.\n\nRead: A flowing nightmare: Women bear disproportionate burden as floods wreak havoc\n\nThe study catalogues insights into the gendered impacts from the case studies.\n\nThese include: likelihood of withdrawal of girls from school to help with domestic work; sexual exploitation and abuse of girls and women in camps; food and nutrition insecurity for pregnant and lactating women; burden of care work on women; disruption of women’s access to health services; women’s loss of livelihoods; trafficking and migration of women for work; and inability of elderly women to leave shelters because of lack of resources to rebuild their homes. Fine.\n\nBut by just focusing on women and girls, the study forgets that men and boys complete the gender equation. Where girls are withdrawn from school, there are boys retained to engage in casual labour to generate income for families.\n\nRead: Institutionalise disaster risk management\n\nWhere there is sexual exploitation and abuse of girls and women, there are boys and men psychologically devastated by the violence and humiliated by the apparent inability to protect their significant others.\n\nWhere women’s nutrition and health are compromised, there are men pressured to feed them and fund their healthcare.\n\nWhere women are sequestered in shelters, there are men forced to walk long distances in search of wage earning work at the expense of emotional and physical company of families.\n\nWhere women and girls are disproportionately affected by waterborne diseases, men are also exposed to vagaries of rainy cold weather and working in dangerous occupations.\n\nRead: A flowing nightmare: Women bear disproportionate burden as floods wreak havoc\n\nWhere women face a heavier domestic workload, there are men pressured by social norms to prove their masculinity by ensuring that their families are sheltered, fed and protected. That men are traditionally expected to provide immediate protection places them on the frontline of danger as they confront the risks faced by their dependents. The men risk their lives to do this.\n\nThe bottomline is that studies should stop giving the impression that women and men live parallel lives. When a family farm is destroyed, everyone is negatively affected. Because men are the traditional owners of family assets, it follows logically that they bear the heaviest burden of economic losses from disasters.\n\nThey must thus devise new means of livelihood and of fulfilling their traditional roles, including by engaging in criminal activities and taking huge loans. Such perspectives are hardly ever captured in conventional and politically correct gender studies devoid of nuanced analysis.\n\nRead:Women, children take the brunt of floods in El Nino-ravaged counties\n\nThe Capacities and Vulnerabilities Framework developed by Mary Anderson and Peter Woodrow is relevant in ensuring gender-responsive reaction to disasters. It outlines three types of capacities and vulnerabilities. First are the physical, which are tangible resources available to men and women. These include land, tools and equipment, labour, livestock, housing and infrastructure. This component leads to an inventory of lost physical capital and how best to indemnify affected men and women.\n\nSecond are the social, which concern support systems such as kinship, professional and welfare groups, and religious associations. Third are the attitudinal and motivational – the psychological responses of men and women. It will be realised, for instance, that many men resort to substance abuse and become highly irritable and violent.\n\nWomen tend to take solace in religion. Identifying these tendencies helps in working out measures to prepare the affected to transition from hopelessness. Hopefully, entities responding to the disaster have received basic training in such dynamics to make their work more gender-responsive.\n\nThe writer is a lecturer in Gender and Development Studies at South Eastern Kenya University ([email protected]).\n\n", "author": "By \nDr Okumba Miruka", "date": "Tuesday, May 14, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4303386/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/c1d64602aeb07b2a43f98299a22acf6b/Op/floods-3.jpg", "image_description": "A man helps a woman to cross a flooded road after a downpour.\nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-14T15:43:44Z"}

{"title": "Women must shun the conduct of stereotyping female politicians", "content": "Charity Ngilu, the second governor of Kitui County and one of the two elected women county bosses, thrust herself into Kenya’s presidential race after being in politics for barely five years, as an MP, and after only one parliamentary term.\n\nThe then Kitui Central MP, alongside the late Prof Wangari Maathai, made history with the – no doubt courageous and daring move – to become the first women in the country to contest the presidency – for years an exclusive boys’ club.\n\nThis was in the 1997 General Election that saw Ms Ngilu emerge an impressive fifth, to beat among others, veteran politician Martin Shikuku of Ford Asili, in the contest predictably won by Kanu’s incumbent, the late Daniel Arap Moi.\n\nProf Maathai came 13th in the crowded race of 15 candidates. Although hers has since been a consistence rise in the political leadership, holding Cabinet positions in the successive administration of Presidents Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta (after 2013 elections) – and now governor, Ms Ngilu is yet to attempt the presidency again.\n\nLikewise, Ms Martha Karua, the long serving MP for Gichugu, a former minister in the Kibaki administration and the Narc-Kenya party leader, made a go at the highest office, in the 2013 General Election. She was the only woman in the ring of eight candidates.\n\nElected female governor\n\nIn the 2017 elections, Ms Karua returned to her Kirinyaga home county, contested the governorship and lost to Ms Anne Waiguru – the other elected female governor – in a closely contested race. Ms Karua disputed the results and unsuccessfully challenged them up to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn November last year, however, she won a reprieve at the Arusha-based East African Court of Justice and was awarded Sh2.7 million in damages for violations of her rights to a fair hearing in the petition.\n\nNairobi’s Anne Kananu Mwenda, was sworn in as the deputy governor last month, to replace impeached Mike Mbuvi Sonko. He had nominated her as his deputy before he was pushed out of office through a no-confidence vote by the Nairobi County Assembly.\n\nThis is just but a brief summary of recent history that tells of the struggles as well as experiences and of course resilience, of some of the most outstanding Kenyan women in the country’s male-dominated field – as they seek to fight their way to the nation’s top political echelons and leadership.\n\nElective political office\n\nAlthough more women are now moving to top management roles in other sectors, indications are clear that the journey to high – specifically elective political office, is still replete with thorns. This reluctance to level the political field to ensure fair competition of women and men is what makes many Kenyans of goodwill – especially women – be deeply sceptical that there will be gender parity in the country’s politics.\n\nAs Kenya’s women battle for political space and top positions in politics, however, it is important for them to celebrate and support those already,  or on their way up, after defying many odds to achieve that feat. That support – moral or otherwise – by fellow women, is critical in encouraging those who intend to join politics to do so, with the knowledge that a sister will be present to not only egg them on, but to also give a shoulder to cry on.\n\nSimilarly, most of those already in positions will without a doubt, do with the encouragement, support and even mentorship of fellow women, to keep moving on.\n\nThat is why women should keep away from the common conduct of stereotyping leaders of the female gender, especially those in politics. This, however, is not to say that women should not criticise their own when they stray as leaders. Asking that of women is undemocratic and amounts to suppressing their voices.\n\nGender parity\n\nIt is also undemocratic – and this is very common, when leaders – in explaining away the low number of elected women in Parliament and County Assembly, take to a blanket blame of women voters “who are the majority, and cannot elect their own’’! Women, like all other Kenyans, are entitled to vote for candidates of their choice, irrespective of the gender.\n\nInstead, as Kenyans, we must support women leadership by electing those qualified to the position. In the meantime, history has taught us that when women are not elected and appointed to political office, political decisions made do not sufficiently serve the needs and inclinations of the female gender.\n\nThat is why women leaders and those who support the course of gender parity must learn to reject and keep voicing out against the notion that women are to be “given” positions. Women and men are equal in the eyes of Kenya’s Constitution.\n\nNjeri Rugene, a journalist, is founder and executive director, The Woman’s Newsroom Foundation.

{"title": " ", "content": "President William Ruto has opened talks on the formation of a coalition political party akin to Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja One Kenya after Amani National Congress (ANC) agreed to fold but tabled other options the 2027 mega party plan should take.\n\nA coalition, proponents have argued, would help parties maintain their identities, but also allow them to work as one unit, if the letter and spirit of the coalition party law is adhered to.\n\nThe other option on the table is a merger where all parties dissolve and form a new one with a new identity and structure.\n\nPresident Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) had initially proposed that all Kenya Kwanza affiliates fold and join it, a proposal now becoming less popular as parties argue about the disadvantage of losing their identities.\n\nAlso Read: Concern as cases of political violence and impunity surge in Kisii\n\nIn folding the affiliates into UDA, the President’s outfit would remain as the mother party.\n\nA coalition political party, according to the Registrar of Political Parties, is exempted from sections 5 and 6 of the Political Parties Act, 2011. When parties join to form a coalition party, they still retain their identities, just as ODM, Jubilee, Wiper, Narc Kenya, DAP-K and more than 20 other Azimio affiliate parties retain theirs.\n\nUDA Secretary-General Cleophas Malala confirmed to the Nation that even though the push to have Kenya Kwanza affiliates fold to strengthen UDA was still on, “there are also proposals for a merger and formation of a coalition political party that we are considering”.\n\nAlso Read: Party power play and the high stakes in Ruto's UDA party elections\n\nIf the merger option is adopted, all parties in Kenya Kwanza will seize to exist, including UDA.\n\nThis is akin to the formation of Jubilee Party in 2016 when former President Uhuru Kenyatta’s The National Alliance (TNA) party and President Ruto’s United Republican Alliance (URP), among other nine parties, dissolved to form Jubilee, which was Mr Kenyatta’s 2017 re-election vehicle.\n\nPresident Ruto, the Nation established, has signalled plans to boost cooperation between UDA and its affiliates in the Kenya Kwanza administration, which would see members of the outfits benefit from State appointments and other roles.\n\nThe move suggests a strategy to reward loyal parties and their members with government jobs and opportunities to solidify his political alliance and ensure support for the administration’s agenda ahead of the 2027 elections.\n\nAlso Read: Luhya unity bid: ODM’s Wycliffe Oparanya calls on Mudavadi, Wetang’ula to fold their parties\n\nGovernment sources indicated to the Nation that the re-establishment of the position of Deputy Comptroller of State House by President Ruto on Tuesday, and subsequent appointment of former ANC Secretary-General Simon Gikuru to the position, was the first sign that the Head of State is keen on rewarding loyal partners.\n\nThe sources intimated that “Gikuru’s appointment is just one of the major indications by President Ruto that he is ready to bring into his inner sanctum partners who are ready to work closely with him without putting other cards under the table”.\n\nANC, founded by Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, had shown its willingness to fold and join UDA.\n\n“I want to make it clear and to other ANC supporters, although I may not be the official party leader today, but as a strong member of ANC party, I must tell you frankly our conversation must be serious about how to strengthen the Kenya Kwanza administration and how to work very closely with UDA, which is the principal party in the coalition and to even engage in deeper debates. Don’t ask me which deeper debates.\n\n\"That’s for another day. Another earthquake is in the offing,” Mr Mudavadi said last month.\n\nPrime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi in his office at the Treasury Building in Nairobi on June 20, 2023.\nPhoto credit: File | Nation Media Group\n\nMr Malala told the Nation that having Kenya Kwanza affiliates fold into UDA was still in their plans.\n\n“This conversation is ongoing and we have assured our affiliates and other willing parties that we are coming with clean hands. I wish to state that already, like-minded parties such as ANC have shown positive interest and in the recent past proposed merger as opposed to folding, and the talks are ongoing for the benefit of all of us,” Mr Malala said.\n\nHe went on: “We are calling on other like-minded parties to engage in this discussion and we are open to better ideas.”\n\nAlso Read: Earthquake II: Why ANC, UDA merger will shift power dynamics in Mudavadi, Gachagua duel\n\nWhen asked whether the government was using State goodies to lure parties to fold, Mr Malala said: “This government belongs to all. Of course we have pre-election coalition agreements with our affiliate parties which the President is still committed to implement, but other terms of engagement will still emerge as President Ruto is a man who keeps his promises.”\n\nAccording to political analyst Martin Oloo, the President’s move “is reflective of the strongman syndrome”.\n\n“The President is an accomplished political operative. His style and motif is reflective of the strongman syndrome. The idea of total hold on power is the driver behind the quest for an established hegemony, an all-powerful political party, with him in command. He is a tried child of Kanu,” Mr Oloo said.\n\nPresident Ruto, Mr Oloo added, “is an admirer of the Chinese approach to a monolithic political party machine and the idea of an all-powerful UDA fascinates the politician in him”.\n\nFor Mr Herman Manyora, President Ruto’s quest “is an ambitious move to help him consolidate his power in the lead up to the elections of 2027”.\n\n“The main danger he will have to reckon with is (Deputy President) Rigathi Gachagua’s fury. This merger will bring people like Mudavadi and (Speaker Moses) Wetang’ula into competition with Gachagua,” he said.\n\nPolitical and governance expert Javas Bigambo said that President Ruto’s plan is “trite logic since he must face the 2027 elections with a very different and possibly superior strategy than 2022”.\n\n“That needs a stronger political machinery, a larger coalition and even bring in new faces and coalition partners. So having present Kenya Kwanza affiliate parties fold is to reduce their bargaining power toward 2027, and give room for negotiating with new coalition partners,” Mr Bigambo said.\n\nBut Mr Malala argued that the idea for a strong party is a positive one.\n\n“That’s why we are calling on our affiliates and other parties to buy this idea as it will change the country’s political landscape and build strong parties as institutions of democracy. We want to go the way of ANC and CCM of South Africa and Tanzania, respectively,” Mr Malala said.\n\n\n\n[email protected]\n\n", "author": "By \nJustus Ochieng'", "date": "Saturday, May 18, 2024", "image_url": "https://nation.africa/resource/image/4437728/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/ffd11653e27b9a5ca6c0eb9c64a5c30c/wk/ruto-uda.jpg", "image_description": "President William Ruto addressing delegates during the UDA National Governing Council meeting at the Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi on September 29, 2023.  Photo credit: File| Nation Media Group", "category": "News", "source": "Daily Nation", "sort_data": "2024-05-18T02:30:00Z"}
