"All about Endometriosis, the beast Njambi Koikai battled","Njambi Koikai's life story, both online and offline, was woven with a singular thread: her unwavering battle against endometriosis.

After a gruelling fight that spanned over a decade, the former radio host passed away on Monday.

Koikai bravely endured more than 20 surgeries to manage the pain, and became a vocal advocate for endometriosis awareness.

Her passing leaves a void, but also a burning desire to learn more about endometriosis.

Dr Steve Mutiso, an obstetrician-gynaecologist, who specialises in minimal access surgery at The Aga Khan University Hospital, explains.

What is endometriosis?

Let’s start with the basics. The uterus is a structure in a female’s body that is designed for carrying a baby, and the womb has layers that serve different purposes.

The innermost layer is called the endometrial lining, and this is the layer that comes out every month as menstrual period— a shedding of that inner lining of the womb.

Endometriosis, therefore, is the presence of the lining of the womb, which is called the endometrium, at a site that is not within the womb.

And it can be anywhere.

For instance, on top of the womb, on the ovaries, inside the tummy, and even in distant sites such as the lungs and the brain.

Is it possible for one to know that they have endometriosis even before they visit a health facility?

To answer that question, I'll go back to what this disease is.

So, at the point when a woman is shedding off that lining, the signal usually doesn't come from the womb.

It comes from other centres to tell the womb this is not conceived, and there is need to shed off this lining inside the womb to prepare for the next cycle.

When you have endometriosis, it means all those other abnormal sites that have that lining of the womb will also get the signal to be shed off and bleed.

But because they're in a site that is not where they were designed to be in, they cause a lot of intense reaction around that site.

And this intense reaction initially is manifested as period pain that is out of proportion of what we expect.

Period pain shouldn't limit you from doing your daily activities. Anything that's outside that context is not normal period pain.

And any woman who has abnormal period pain should always be thinking, could this be unusual and possibly endometriosis?

When does it occur?

It can occur at the onset of menstruation or even later.

And this is true by the kind of endometriosis patients we see. We have some as young as 13, and as old as 45 to 50 years old.

As this disease develops, the longer it's present, the more intense the symptoms seem to become.

Are there different stages of endometriosis, maybe in terms of pain?

Yes, and it is based on where it originates from and we have four stages.

On the first, you have little or no damage to the structures that it’s on.

As you progress to stage two, three, and four, the damage to the structures becomes more.

The further it is away from the origin of the lining, the higher the staging.

With regards to the pain, it's not related to the extent of the disease. And what I mean by this is that you can have really bad endometriosis, which we call stage four disease, but the pain could be much less than someone who has an early-stage endometriosis.

Could you talk to us about the different diagnostic options available for endometriosis in Kenya, and its prevalence?

Statistics show that one in six to one in 10 women might have some form of endometriosis.

But looking at the bigger context, any woman who comes in with significant period pain and doesn't have a cause on normal ultrasound imaging, most of them might have endometriosis.

There are many ways you can diagnose it. One, and what is usually the first way, is just by the symptoms.

The second way is by imaging, like doing a pelvic ultrasound, whereby we're able to investigate the pelvis from outside.

The only limitation of this imaging is that early in the disease, the damage is so small that you might not be able to see anything on the scans but in the latter stages it could pick it up really well.

The last way we diagnose is by seeing it with our eyes through a form of surgery called laparoscopy— camera surgery that makes tiny cuts in the tummy to look for the endometriosis lesions.

All these three modalities are available in Kenya.

And treatment options?

The best options usually are removal of these abnormal lining bits that are outside the womb, and that involves surgery.

We also have medications that we can give that counteract the hormones in a woman's body that aid in the growth of endometriosis.

The problem with endometriosis is that because this lining is present in a woman's body throughout her life, there is still a chance that it will recur because the genetic problem that is there, causing this disease to form, will still be present in this woman's body throughout her reproductive life.

I always tell my patients once we've diagnosed endometriosis that we are together until the time they finish their reproductive life because they will probably require consistent reviews and reassessments to aid in improving their quality of life.

Are there any new or emerging treatments for endometriosis, whether in Kenya or globally?

Notably there's not much change in terms of the treatment profile.

But there are other drugs coming into the market that actually might postpone the need for surgery, and these are available worldwide, even in Kenya.

Is it preventable, and is it hereditary?

Hereditary? yes, it is.

There are genes that make women predisposed to having endometriosis.

On prevention, it is a difficult question to answer.

What we know with endometriosis is that you can't prevent the disease.

If it's going to come, it's going to come either way but one can be vigilant to the symptoms we've touched on which will aid in earlier diagnosis and prevention of the complications that it can bring.

What would you want women with endometriosis to know?

This is one of the diseases that one can live a normal life with, especially if it's diagnosed at an early stage and they get the correct treatment.

Also, treatment does exist in the country.

The last thing is that having endometriosis should not limit a woman's ability to be the best they can be, you know, socially, professionally, in life, especially, and that actually is usually the aim of treatment— to try and return this woman's life back to normal. I would also urge those experiencing abnormal period pain to get an assessment.

Is there a correlation between endometriosis and infertility?

One of the biggest burdens of concern with endometriosis is its impact on the ability of a woman to conceive.

A good number of women will have lesions of endometriosis on the fallopian tubes, where fertilisation occurs.

And because of the continuous irritation of the disease on these tubes, they might damage the tubes.

Moreover, just the presence of endometriosis lesions around the ovaries and tubes seems to significantly prevent conception even though there may not be any physical damage to these structures.

"Why millions of girls, women continue to suffer from period poverty","Rose Achieng'* is a teenage girl living in the sprawling Kibera slums. She shares with Nation.Africa some of the challenges she faces as an adolescent.

The 16-year-old from Lindi village at the heart of the sprawling Kibera in Nairobi notes lack of sanitary towels as one of the main problems that she encounters every month.

“My mother in many instances lacks the money to buy the sanitary towels for me. I am usually forced to seek assistance from Kirta Touch the Needy, a non-governmental organisation that provides sanitary towels to the needy girls in the slums. Whenever they do not have, I have to look for alternatives, including using old clothes,” she says.

Achieng’s predicament is not isolated. It mirrors those of millions of other girls across the world who are unable to afford menstrual products.

According to the latest survey by UN Women, millions of women and girls worldwide still cannot afford menstrual products or access water and sanitation facilities to manage their menstrual health and hygiene.

The survey lists stigma, high cost of menstrual products, and lack of water and sanitation facilities as some of the drivers of period poverty, which is also perpetuated by stigma and the lack of information and education as many girls and young women lack awareness and are unprepared for their periods.

More than 1.5 billion people still lack basic sanitation services, such as private toilets.

“Menstrual products are prohibitively expensive for millions of people worldwide. Gender-blind policies and tax laws on feminine products – are, in part, to blame, but such policy decisions go together with the stigma and taboo attached to menstruation,” the UN Women Survey reads.

The UN agency notes that at least one in 10 women and girls in rural areas across 12 countries did not have a private place to wash and change during their last periods.

In Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Madagascar and Zimbabwe, for example, adolescent girls and women in urban areas are more likely to use sanitary pads than those in rural areas, who are more likely to use cloth and sponges.

One in five adolescent girls and women in rural Ethiopia used no materials, compared with 1 in 20 in urban areas, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef data.

In the United States, one in four teens and one in three adults struggle to afford period products, especially teenagers of colour and from lower-income households.

A 2020 survey by Plan International showed that three in 10 girls in the United Kingdom struggle to afford or access menstrual products and more than half of them used toilet paper instead.

In a recent UN Women's report from Gaza, more than 540,000 women and girls of reproductive age lack access to items to support their hygiene, health and dignity.

They are resorting to cloth or sponges because they cannot access menstrual products. UN Women estimates that 10 million disposable menstrual pads are needed each month to cover the needs and preserve the dignity of women and girls in Gaza.

The survey indicates that period poverty is also perpetuated by stigma and lack of information and education.

It also finds that policymakers and adults with decision-making power in schools and workplaces also lack comprehensive menstrual education.

From mindless scrolling on Twitter to winning big at the global stage,"By Daniel Apolo

In the vast world of social media and technological advancements, opportunities often come when least expected. For me, Daniel Apolo Ochola, Information Technology student at Mount Kenya University, one such opportunity came as I was scrolling through Twitter one evening.

It was just like any other evening, casually browsing through tweets when a particular post caught my eye. The Huawei Talent ICT Academy competition announcement stood out among the countless tweets, offering tracks in cloud computing, networking, and computing. My curiosity was instantly aroused, so I clicked on the link to learn more.

As I read through the details, it became clear that this competition was something I couldn't miss. With tracks covering the most booming technological shifts, it seemed tailor-made for someone like me who wanted to stay ahead of the curve in the IT industry.

From that moment on, my journey with the Huawei Talent ICT Academy competition began. From August to November 2023, I dedicated myself to self-study, immersing myself in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data.

The preliminary examination in November was the first real test of my knowledge and preparation. Despite the nerves, I performed well enough to advance to the national level.

The national examination in December was intense, but my determination paid off when I secured the second position in the cloud track, out of six talented individuals selected based on merit. This achievement propelled me to the regional finals, where I represented Kenya in the Southern Africa Region.

Training at the Huawei office in Lavington for two months in preparation for the Regional Competition level was a transformative experience. Interacting with professionals in the field not only enhanced my knowledge but also gave me a glimpse into the real-world application of what I had learned.

The journey took an unexpected turn when I found myself forming a team with Ian Omwenga and Mark Omaiko, both from Machakos University, for the regional competition. Little did I know that this collaboration would lead us to clinch the second position out of 13 teams in the region, earning us a spot in the global finals in Shenzhen, China.

Being among the 18 students who represented Kenya at the global finals on May 22, 2024 felt surreal. It was an honour to carry the flag of my country and my region on such a prestigious platform.

The main lessons I drew from the competition at the national and regional levels were perseverance and collaboration. The competition taught me that success is not just about individual brilliance but also about working together as a team.

From a casual Twitter scroll to representing Kenya at the global finals, the journey has been remarkable. The lessons learned, friendships made, and experiences gained along the way have been invaluable.

As the day of the global finals approached, my expectations were high. I anticipated fierce competition from talented individuals worldwide. However, I was confident in our abilities and the skills we had honed throughout the journey. I also looked forward to making friends from different parts of the world.

Traveling to Shenzhen, China for the Huawei ICT Talent Academy global finals was an eye-opening experience. The city's advanced civilization, characterised by its impressive road infrastructure and the disciplined, organised nature of its people, left me in awe. Our visits to Huawei's exhibition halls were particularly inspiring, as we witnessed cutting-edge innovations like self-driving intelligent vehicle systems, generative AI, and advancements in the telecommunications industry, including super 5G technology. These experiences not only broadened my understanding of the latest technological trends but also reinforced my passion for IT.

Moreover, the opportunity to explore Shenzhen and interact with fellow competitors from around the world enriched my cultural perspective. Engaging with peers from Asian countries, South America, China, and fellow African nations such as Nigeria, Tunisia, Tanzania, and Uganda allowed us to share and appreciate diverse cultural values and practices. These interactions forged new friendships and professional connections, highlighting the universal language of technology that brings us all together. The entire journey was a blend of professional growth, cultural exchange, and personal development. A truly unforgettable experience.

Adding to the excitement, my team finished third in the competition. This achievement was a testament to our hard work and the unwavering support we received from both Huawei and our universities, particularly Mount Kenya University. The intensive training sessions provided by Huawei, coupled with the constant encouragement from our school, played a crucial role in our success. Additionally, our teamwork and collaboration were pivotal. Working closely with Ian Omwenga and Mark Omaiko both from Machakos University, we were able to leverage each other's strengths and overcome challenges together. This collective effort not only validated our dedication but also highlighted the importance of a strong support system and effective teamwork.

I’m very grateful for the university's support as we prepared for the global finals. Beyond the competition itself, this journey has already had a profound impact on my career and friendships. The knowledge gained and the practical exposure during the training have equipped me with valuable skills that will undoubtedly benefit my future endeavours. Through the exposure to cutting edge technologies and rigorous trainings, my passion for IT has been rejuvenated. Additionally, the friendships forged with Ian and Mark, and the connections I am yet to make at the global level, are invaluable assets that will last a lifetime.

I eagerly await the next chapter of this remarkable journey, ready to represent my university, my country, and my region with pride and determination.

Nyeri family in agony after nanny disappears with one-year-old son,"For the past six days, Joyce Wanjeri has been tirelessly searching for her one-year-old son, but to no avail. Her son, Ian Kariuki, was allegedly stolen by his nanny on May 31, she says.

Her efforts, along with those of the Missing Child Kenya Foundation, have led to several clues as to the whereabouts of the suspect - Jane Nyambura - although some have unfortunately hit dead ends.

The police are investigating the matter. The case was reported at Kiamwathi Patrol Base and recorded under Occurrence Book (OB) number 02/01/06/2024.

""The suspect was last seen in Mweiga town, Nyeri on Tuesday, June 4 at 8am, accompanied by another woman who was carrying my son on her back. The three entered a hotel and asked for food,"" Wanjeri said in an interview.

At the hotel, a customer bought them food and also volunteered to buy flour for the child at a nearby shop.

It was only after they had left that the hotel owner realised that one of the women she had served was the same person whose photo had been circulating on social media for a few days.

""The hotel owner alerted us and confirmed with the police that the person she had seen was indeed the suspect we had been looking for all along,"" said Wanjeri.

The information was a ray of hope for the family, who have been travelling from town to town in the district whenever they get a tip-off about the suspect's whereabouts.

Wanjeri, a teacher at Mathenge Technical Training Institute in Nyeri, says she had no worries for the past two months when she employed the suspect as a nanny.

""Nyambura was introverted, peace-loving and never mistreated my two boys. She was recommended by her niece who lives in our neighbourhood in Kiamwathi,"" Wanjeri explained.

The suspect used to work as a caretaker for an elderly woman in Chaka town, Nyeri. She resigned after complaining that she was being overworked by being assigned to farm chores.

On the particular day of May 31 when the nanny disappeared with her son, Wanjeri explains that she left for work at around 7.45am after dropping her six-year-old child off at school.

She left her other son sleeping.

""Usually, while the nanny does her chores, my son spends most of his time playing in our compound,"" said Wanjeri.

As is the norm, Wanjeri said information gathered from her neighbours showed that her son was last seen in the compound at 11am that day.

However, her eldest child returned home from school at 5pm to find the house empty.

The search for the two began at 9pm that evening when Wanjeri returned home from work.

What was strange, she says, was that the suspect had left all her belongings behind, including her phone - making it difficult to trace her.

The food she had prepared for the baby's lunch was also well stored in the fridge.

According to Wanjeri, the nanny did not raise any concerns, except for one instance six days before the incident.

""I had just returned home from work when she approached me and complained that her child had been sent home from school for unpaid fees,"" she recalled. Wanjeri then gave her Sh7,000 to cover the outstanding fees of Sh4,000.

The family describes the bond between the nanny and their son as extremely close.

""There were times when my son refused to be held by anyone but his nanny,"" said Wanjeri's husband, Michael Kariuki.

He says he is currently in contact with the nanny's family in Karatina town, where she comes from.

He says he is currently in contact with the nanny's family in Karatina town, where she comes from.

Nyeri family in agony after nanny disappears with one-year-old son,"For the past six days, Joyce Wanjeri has been tirelessly searching for her one-year-old son, but to no avail. Her son, Ian Kariuki, was allegedly stolen by his nanny on May 31, she says.

Her efforts, along with those of the Missing Child Kenya Foundation, have led to several clues as to the whereabouts of the suspect - Jane Nyambura - although some have unfortunately hit dead ends.

The police are investigating the matter. The case was reported at Kiamwathi Patrol Base and recorded under Occurrence Book (OB) number 02/01/06/2024.

""The suspect was last seen in Mweiga town, Nyeri on Tuesday, June 4 at 8am, accompanied by another woman who was carrying my son on her back. The three entered a hotel and asked for food,"" Wanjeri said in an interview.

At the hotel, a customer bought them food and also volunteered to buy flour for the child at a nearby shop.

It was only after they had left that the hotel owner realised that one of the women she had served was the same person whose photo had been circulating on social media for a few days.

""The hotel owner alerted us and confirmed with the police that the person she had seen was indeed the suspect we had been looking for all along,"" said Wanjeri.

The information was a ray of hope for the family, who have been travelling from town to town in the district whenever they get a tip-off about the suspect's whereabouts.

Wanjeri, a teacher at Mathenge Technical Training Institute in Nyeri, says she had no worries for the past two months when she employed the suspect as a nanny.

""Nyambura was introverted, peace-loving and never mistreated my two boys. She was recommended by her niece who lives in our neighbourhood in Kiamwathi,"" Wanjeri explained.

The suspect used to work as a caretaker for an elderly woman in Chaka town, Nyeri. She resigned after complaining that she was being overworked by being assigned to farm chores.

On the particular day of May 31 when the nanny disappeared with her son, Wanjeri explains that she left for work at around 7.45am after dropping her six-year-old child off at school.

She left her other son sleeping.

""Usually, while the nanny does her chores, my son spends most of his time playing in our compound,"" said Wanjeri.

As is the norm, Wanjeri said information gathered from her neighbours showed that her son was last seen in the compound at 11am that day.

However, her eldest child returned home from school at 5pm to find the house empty.

The search for the two began at 9pm that evening when Wanjeri returned home from work.

What was strange, she says, was that the suspect had left all her belongings behind, including her phone - making it difficult to trace her.

The food she had prepared for the baby's lunch was also well stored in the fridge.

According to Wanjeri, the nanny did not raise any concerns, except for one instance six days before the incident.

""I had just returned home from work when she approached me and complained that her child had been sent home from school for unpaid fees,"" she recalled. Wanjeri then gave her Sh7,000 to cover the outstanding fees of Sh4,000.

The family describes the bond between the nanny and their son as extremely close.

""There were times when my son refused to be held by anyone but his nanny,"" said Wanjeri's husband, Michael Kariuki.

He says he is currently in contact with the nanny's family in Karatina town, where she comes from.

 ,"The larger construction sector has been pushing its boundaries toward sustainability, and the paints industry is a front liner in that shift. The coatings industry has always been dynamic, with constant innovation disrupting the sector, every now and then.

DN2 Property talked to Arvind Shekhawat, the Chief Executive Officer of Kansai Plascon, East Africa, about the transition to sustainable paints.

He takes us back in time to over a century ago when the company was founded, through the intriguing journey of embracing biodiversity and sustainability in its operations — ultimately incorporating the painters, users, factory workers and the environment’s best interests.

What is the history behind Kansai Plascon and what are some of your biggest milestones?

Kansai Paint was founded in 1918 by Katsujiro Iwai, and has grown into one of top 10 global paint companies. Post World War II the company grew rapidly between 1948 and 1986. A key milestone was the listing on the Osaka, Tokyo, and Kobe stock exchanges in 1949.

Global expansion started as early as the 1980’s through various joint ventures in multiple countries. Several subsidiaries were acquired in the early 2000s across Asia, Europe, and the USA. Kansai Paint’s expansion into emerging markets took place as recently as 2010 with acquisitions in South Africa and Vietnam.

Focused on innovations

In recent years, the company has focused on innovations — one of our most exciting ones was demonstrating how its plaster coating can deactivate Covid -19 in 2020.

Kansai Paint acquired Plascon in South Africa in 2012, forming Kansai Plascon. Kansai Plascon East Africa was launched in 2016 with the acquisition of local paint businesses in 2017. The group company, Kansai Paint, operates in over 43 countries globally. On the African continent, Kansai Plascon operates in over 20 countries including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.

How has your product portfolio grown through the years?

To understand the humble beginnings of Kansai Paint and Plascon, one has to only look at the initial product offering of Plascon in South Africa back in 1889. The company founded by Herbert Evans, manufactured polishes and varnishes and then moved into ready tinted paints.

Kansai Plascon now offers multiple products, different grades of products and price points across the entire spectrum of paints including decorative, automotive, protective and industrial paints with 43 production sites across the globe. One of Kansai Paint’s key strengths is its research and development capabilities which sets our company apart and allows the group to provide unparalleled products and services around the world.

In 2018, Kansai celebrated its 100th anniversary — having been in the industry for so long, what are some of the most dynamic shifts you’ve lived through?

Paint products

One of the biggest changes in the paint industry has been the focus given to improving the health of the people making, using and living with paint products. For example, in the late 70s and the years that followed, the industry moved away from the use of lead and a lot of awareness was raised about the dangers thereof.

We have also embraced increasing care for the painter’s health while applying our products and shifted focus to the development of water-based paints. And now there is a lot of focus given to sustainability. Large companies such as Kansai Paint are transitioning to measuring, managing and setting metrics to achieve their sustainability goals.

Speaking of sustainability, could you elaborate on the practices the paints industry is embracing?

There are a number of practices globally such as the move towards water-based paints, which reduces the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into the environment. Water-based paints emphasise the use of a renewable and more natural raw material — water. The use of renewable sources of raw materials and energies is a focus for most businesses these days.

The industry is also shifting to biodegradable and recycled raw materials which reduce the industry’s impact on the environment as components of the paint are biodegradable at the end of their life cycle. Recycled materials reduce the need for new raw materials — a fact that eases the pressure on resources. Businesses are also looking at their processes and how they can reduce waste, increase efficiencies, all while building robust and capable enterprises that can last generations, thereby, creating employment many years to come.

Has Kansai Plascon shifted to any sustainable business practices?

As the leading paint manufacturer in East Africa, we at Kansai Plascon, have to consider how sustainability impacts our value chain and our impact on the societies and the environments in which we operate.

The integration of Quality Management Systems (QMS), Environmental Management Systems and Occupational Safety and Health Systems into our production and supply chains via IMS ISO Certifications contributes to our sustainable practices.

I have a personal philosophy known as “grow our own timber” which refers to growing both the person and company hand-in-hand. We invest in skills development at Kansai Plascon, our staff receives training annually to upskill them for the demands of the business and to ensure that we remain relevant and competitive. All of these aspects lead to a sustainable and skilled workforce.

What about the products you make — how are you making them more sustainable?

This year we have subscribed to the Extended Production Responsibility Scheme. The scheme ensures all our post-consumer packaging waste material is sustainably managed and is in line with the Solid Waste Management Act of Kenya.

Fewer fumes

From a product perspective, our entire premium range of Plascon water-based products such as Vinyl Silk, Vinyl Matt, Weatherguard and Silicone Exterior Protection, from Kansai Plascon are all low VOC with less than 5 grams of VOCs per litre. Our paints are considered safer for the environment and human health because they have lower emissions and fewer fumes.

Traditional solvent-based paints release significant amounts of VOCs. Water-based paints, which use water as a solvent, drastically cut down VOC emissions and are less toxic. We are thorough with our research and development, striving to develop more water-based products that can substitute the solvent-based paints.

We are also focusing on waste reduction through our processes while maximising recycling within our manufacturing plants. We ensure that through our effluent treatment plant, we recover the dirty water from our production processes and use the same for cleaning purposes. With our solvent recovery plant, we recover organic solvents and recycle them to avoid dumping them into the environment.

One concern some might have is that sustainable paints might sacrifice performance. How does your company address?

Low VOC paints, in particular water-based paints, are not under performers. In fact, they have some unique benefits. They provide good colour consistency, they don’t yellow as quickly as some solvent-based paints, they dry quickly have good longevity.

In addition, the quality of our systems and products is in line with the principles of ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018, which we integrate into our production and supply chain processes.

Beyond sustainability, what other exciting innovations have come up in the industry?

I think the intersection between paint and healthcare is an interesting development. Here in East Africa, Kansai Plascon has introduced anti-mosquito paint with the objective of becoming an additional vector against the spread of malaria and the terrible impact the disease has on children under the age of 5 years old. Our hygienic coatings are designed to enhance the appearance and durability of surfaces while also promoting good health and hygiene. An exciting global innovation is the move towards water-borne paints in the automotive segment.

What are some of the biggest challenges facing the wider paint industry in making a transition to more sustainable practices?

The development and access to affordable raw materials, or paint ingredients, that support sustainability is a challenge. Also many raw materials in East Africa are imported making paint companies dependent on imports, this requires a vast amount of transport, all of which use fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases. Overall, the supply chain’s unexpected disruptions such as war in various countries or the pandemic, impact costs which then affects products and the end users have to make tough choices regarding which products and what level of quality they are willing to spend on.

In terms of chromate and lead-free pigments, the alternatives tend to be more expensive than the existing products and in many cases the end-user is not ready to pay the higher price to get this more environmentally friendly product. This has to be one of the biggest challenges in producing sustainable paints.

Paints tend to be diverse depending on where they are to be used, who should consider investing in sustainable paint products or where should they be applied?

Everyone should consider sustainable options where they are available. Water-based paints are widely available and have the features to be used throughout one’s home or building project. For example, using Plascon Vinyl Silk in high traffic areas of the home where the family spends a lot of time such as the kitchen or living room where a washable, hard wearing and fashionable sheen product makes sense.

What other factors should consumers consider when choosing paints for different projects?

Plascon manuals

The first thing to consider when choosing paint is the area of use. Using the incorrect product will only result in a failure and cost money and time. It’s highly advisable to talk to an expert. Here at Plascon we have a call centre open to the public. Alternatively, read any of the Plascon manuals which give excellent advice on products and where they should be used.

What are your company’s long-term goals regarding sustainability in paint manufacturing?

In line with the Kansai Paint target for the elimination of Persistent Organic Pollutants the company is taking steps to comply with both the Stockholm Convention and Montreal Protocol to which Kenya is a signatory to ensure that we do not use any of the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) listed by both agreements.

The Kansai Paint group has four key materiality topics, they are: decarbonisation, improving quality of life, enhancing resource and economic circulation, and diversity. They have been given KPI’s to achieve by 2030. The philosophy is that the group should pursue the 2030 KPI’s and that will put the company on the correct path to achieving the materiality topics by 2050.

The KPI’s are there to challenge each business to do things differently, taking large and necessary steps to achieve sustainability. Some of our Kansai Paint KPIs include a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases, 15 percent of energy sources to be renewable and 30 percent of management to be female, just to name a few.

Lastly, we are continuously conducting research and development to improve our products’ performance as well as meet sustainability goals. This research also reaches beyond the physical products as we consider using renewable energies and recycling at our offices and factories. We believe that paint has always played a part in maintaining or creating sustainability because a coated or painted surface will last longer.

Parting shot?

I believe the future is bright for East Africa and, specifically the Kenyan construction industry. We have invested in the region and continue to do so which will create more employment and further development for all stakeholders. With factories in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and exports into Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are perfectly poised for sustainable growth in the region.

Story of a ghostly Safari told through bedsheets,"I stood rooted to the spot, literally feeling my blood run cold – even though I was very warmly dressed in my sky blue windbreaker over a black T-shirt – as I stared at the ghost of my cousin.

Safari was dressed in a formal purple shirt, grey khaki pants but sported a shaggy chin and bushy hair, like a chap who hadn’t been to the barber for at least a month.

“Won’t you ask me to come in,” his ghost said, “Or will you leave me here to…”

‘Drown?’ I said in my head, picturing him being swept away in that black Mazda weeks ago.

“…freeze to death in this June chill?”

‘Maybe we feel cold in the presence of ghosts because they are so cold themselves,’ I thought. ‘Unless they come back from hell. Those ones would be hot ghosts.’

Without waiting for an answer, Safari brushed by me, causing the hairs to rise on my arms.

I followed him, but my knees let me down, and I sagged onto the sofa.

After a short while, during which I dared not go into the kitchen lest I find no one there, Safari came back with two tumblers of whiskey.

“A-ar-are you for for…real?” I whispered, after my first swig of whiskey.

“Don’t I look real?” Safari answered, laughing as he also sipped his drink. “I know you think I died, but I did not, Safara.”

I felt a deep tidal wave of relief wash over my body, as Safari got into an incredible story.

Rescued by good Samaritans from the floating debris of the Mazda, with no identity cards on him and short term amnesia, he had spent about a week in a small hospital in Mazeras.

“As my memory returned, I remembered I had taken out some travel insurance with the excellent firm Ensign,” and when he checked, it had an ‘in case of fatal accident’ clause.

So Safari Safara had lain low for another week (after secretly leaving the hospital at night), living at a cheap lodging that did not give a fig about his identity, “just show us the money…”

“How much is the pay out from the insurance?” I found myself whispering.

“Sh1, 589, 398,” he said.

“How much?” I asked.

“One million, five hundred and eighty nine thousand, three hundred and ninety eight bob,” my first cousin said. “Must I spell out figures for you in words, Mike?”

“You are presumed dead, Safari,” I said. “And dead men cannot collect cheques.”

“But their living kin can tell tales, and collect insurance cash as beneficiaries,” Safari said. “I’d made you the beneficiary of the travel life policy. So now you get to collect, cuz…”

“It’s okay,” I whispered, feeling as if still in a vivid dream. “And I will give you every cent, Saf!”

He laughed. “You can’t send money to dead dudes either, bro. You keep it. You need it!”

“How will you, we, ever get away with this, Safari?”

“Easy, Mike,” he replied. “I just quietly slip off to the DRC, I have pals there. Get fake travel docs. Then use my real ones to get into Canada, stay there till end year, then quietly re-enter the US.”

“Your siblings think you are dead, Saf,” I said. “So, you will just show up resurrected at their front door?” Safari shrugged. “Exactly!” and realising that’s what he’d done with me, we both burst into laughter. “No company will go all FBI over paying out a mere meter half to a flood victim, brother…”

That broke me, and I burst into loud sobs, crying “I’m sorry, so sorry, Safari,” as he stared at me.

We are Old School – and did not cry, let alone weep loudly, in front of other men (and most women).

At that moment, the doorbell chimed loudly, and in a second, my inner pendulum swung from sorrow to panic.

Pulling my cousin by the sleeve into the bedroom, I whispered: “That’s Desiree. She cannot find you here because of your insurance plan. Stay here, and I will get rid of her pronto, bro…”

Closing the bedroom door, I walked to the front door, where the doorbell was being buzzed as if by a demoness possessed.Panic had turned to a ball of anger by the time I flung the door open, to find Desiree Simaloi standing there in a simple black dress and heels, a necklace of faux pas pearls around her neck.

“I know I have your tablet, Desiree,” I started, staring at her coldly. “But you cannot come here…”

“Screw the laptop,” she said breathily, and then strongly shoved me back into the door.

“It’s your lap tops I want!” And the next second, she was ripping off my windbreaker, clawing the T-shirt off as my back banged against the bedroom door, dress off so I saw her abs beneath brasserie; and then we were somehow in the bedroom, my outer pendulum wildly swinging…

‘Where on earth was Safari?’ I thought wildly. ‘In the closet?’

Then I realised I had no closet, came to the realisation that my cousin must be under the bed.

Hiding – as Simaloi embarked on an endless course of feeding upon sirloin steak insatiably.

It must have been a couple of hours later when an apparition rose from the floor, swathed in the bedsheets we had discarded on the floor. Simaloi let out a blood-curdling scream.

And Safari, his voice hoarse and very annoyed behind the bedsheets said: “I am the ghost of Safari, come to avenge my death after your boyfriend let me drown in the floods. Cousin, I will be back to continue haunting you tomorrow at eight in the evening. Ciao ciao. For now…”

And with that, the ‘ghost’ floated out of my bedroom, but not before accidentally bumping into the wall and crying out “Ouch!”

It must have been a couple of hours later when an apparition rose from the floor, swathed in the bedsheets we had discarded on the floor. Simaloi let out a blood-curdling scream.

And Safari, his voice hoarse and very annoyed behind the bedsheets said: “I am the ghost of Safari, come to avenge my death after your boyfriend let me drown in the floods. Cousin, I will be back to continue haunting you tomorrow at eight in the evening. Ciao ciao. For now…”

And with that, the ‘ghost’ floated out of my bedroom, but not before accidentally bumping into the wall and crying out “Ouch!”

"Uber, Bolt threaten to pull out of Kenya over proposed taxes","Digital ride-hailing platforms Bolt and Uber have warned that they would be forced to close down their operations in Kenya if Parliament approves proposals to impose a six percent tax on gross turnover for non-resident firms.

Bolt and Uber separately told the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee that imposing the Significant Economic Presence Tax (SEP) will likely lead to collapse of the industry due to losses or low margins.

The National Treasury is seeking to impose the SEP, which shall be payable by a non-resident person whose income from the provision of services is derived from or accrues in Kenya through a business carried out over a digital marketplace.

The Bill seeks to remove the Digital Service Tax (DST), which is currently charged at the rate of 1.5 percent, and replace it with the SEP charged at the rate of six percent.

“By introducing the six percent Significant Economic Presence Tax (SEP), the effective tax rate for a non-resident in the digital market space will be 22 percent on gross turnover without taking into consideration the operating costs,” Bolt Public Policy Manager George Abasy said.

“SEP tax at six percent will likely lead to collapse of the industry due to losses or low margins. Non-resident companies currently pay VAT at a rate of 16 percent with no opportunity to deduct input VAT. They also pay 1.5 percent in Digital Service Tax (DST) giving an effective tax rate of 17.5 percent on gross turnover, not profit.”

Bolt Africa Tax Manager Celia Kuria told the committee that is chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani that SEP as a tax on gross turnover is comparable to Turnover Tax, which is currently charged at three percent.

“This shows a significant disparity and disproportionate disfavour to non-resident entities and similarly, foreign direct investment,” Ms Kuria said.

“Note that the ride hailing industry in Kenya is governed by National Transport Safety Authority (NTSA) which has capped ride hailing commissions to 18 percent thereby limiting the company’s ability to generate revenue.”

Ms Kuria said that, should the SEP tax be imposed, Bolt is going to be taxed at 22 percent on the topline in addition to a commission capped at 18 percent and VAT at 16 percent, which will see its earnings from a Sh500 ride drop from a profit of Sh1.40 to a net loss of Sh2.

She told the committee that, when a similar SEP tax was introduced in Nigeria, several multinational companies including Microsoft, GlaxoSmithKline, and Uniliver left the country.

Uber BV director Blair Radford asked the committee to reverse the Bill’s proposal to repeal the 1.5 percent DST and replace it at a higher rate of six percent SEP.

“SEP as proposed does not indicate how a non-resident person will be deemed to have created significant economic presence in Kenya therefore becoming liable to tax in Kenya,” Ms Chizeba Nnonyeh, the tax manager at Uber Africa said. She represented Mr Radford to present Uber concerns on the Finance Bill 2024.

“Taxation on digital services in Kenya is still nascent and the increase in rate from 1.5 percent to six percent is too steep. It will impact on users, drivers, the economy and send the non-resident entities directly into loss.”

Both Uber and Bolt asked the committee to delete the proposal of six percent SEPT and retain the rate of 1.5 percent. The firms also demanded the deletion of section 19 of the Finance Bill, 2024 which seeks to amend the Income Tax Act to introduce Withholding Tax on the payments being made on a digital marketplace, arguing it will include taxi passengers and purchasers of food off platforms.

“It is the payer’s responsibility to account for withholding tax when making payment. However, using the average payment for a ride of Sh500, the proposal suggests that the passenger should remit five percent (Sh25) when they take a ride and make a payment,” the companies said.

I’m a mother of a two-year-old boy living with his father. How can I pursue custody?,"Dear Vivian,

I am a mother of a two-year-old son. Recently, his father took him away from me. I want to seek custody of my child. However, I am not sure where to begin or what is considered in custody cases. Please advise.

Nancy Waihenya,

Dear Nancy,

The term ‘child custody’ is often used when a court is determining which parent, relative, or anyone with a legitimate interest in the child’s welfare should be granted physical and legal custody.

You can commence this process by visiting the children’s office or women’s rights organisations that offer access to justice services to members of the public. Ideally, you shall be led through a process of mediation, which will be aimed at achieving a parental responsibility agreement.

If the mediation process fails, you need to file a custody petition at the Children’s Court. Given the urgency of your situation, you may request interim orders for custody. These are temporary orders that can be issued quickly to ensure the child’s safety and well-being until a final decision is made. To obtain interim custody, you must demonstrate to the court that immediate intervention is necessary.

Read: Court grants mother 9 hours a year in child custody case

The court can also refer you and the child’s father to mediation to try and resolve the custody dispute amicably. This form of mediation is called Court Annexed Mediation. If this process fails, the case will proceed to a full hearing. During the hearing, both parties will present evidence and witnesses to support their claims. The court will examine factors to determine the most suitable custody arrangement.

The primary consideration for the court is the best interest of the child. This includes the child’s emotional, physical, and psychological well-being. The court will then assess the ability of each parent to provide a stable, loving, and nurturing environment.

This includes factors such as parenting skills, mental and physical health and the ability to meet the child’s needs. The court considers the existing relationship between the child and each parent. It will also look at which parent has been the primary caregiver and the emotional bond between the child and each parent.

Read: What the law says about child custody

Further, the safety and stability of the child’s living environment are paramount. The court will consider any history of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. The willingness of each parent to facilitate and encourage a relationship between the child and the other parent is also taken into account.

Therefore, it is beneficial to gather any evidence that demonstrates your ability to provide a loving, stable, and supportive environment for your son. This may include testimonies from friends, family and professionals who can attest to your parenting abilities.

As you commence this process, it is important to note that courts favour arrangements that allow the child to maintain a relationship with both parents, where it is safe and appropriate to do so.

Ultimate Championships to spur athletics growth in Kenya,"As a bedrock of athletics talent, the recently-announced World Ultimate Championships is music to Kenyans ears.

It is a competition that bodes well for the future of millions of athletics talents in the country and heralds a new beginning as far as talent growth and development is concerned.

The Ultimate Championships is a new category of competition announced this week by World Athletics, where the best-of-the-best athletes will compete in different categories across three days.

The competitors will be selected solely on world rankings and comprise 8-16 of the best athletes in each discipline.

The Hungarian capital of Budapest will be the first host of this new competition at the end of 2026 and will be subsequently held biennially, with cities bidding to stage the event.

Thrilling competitions

From an athlete’s perspective, including Kenyan, this championship ensures that the motivation to perform will go up a notch.

No longer will athletes take any competition for granted since they will need to improve their world rankings to earn a berth in the Ultimate Championships.

From a fan viewpoint, expect thrilling track and field competitions in various assignments, such as the Diamond League, World Continental Tours, World Championships, World Road Running Championships, World Race Walking Championships and the Olympics.

Many athletes will focus on the “ultimate prize” as they compete in the events.

Add to the fact that the Ultimate Championships offers the highest prize money ever in athletics circles (Sh1.3 billion) in which winners in different disciplines will go home Sh20 million richer.

From a Kenyan perspective, there is now no more reason for athletes to believe the age-old notion that talent doesn’t pay.

Financial windfall

Indeed, this is the time to train hard and win clean as you steer clear of any vices that might stifle your promising career.

To be part of the Ultimate Championships will be the perfect dream for many athletes, most of whom come from humble backgrounds.

Beyond the financial windfall, there is the prestige of emerging top ahead of other kings or queens of your respective disciplines.

As one of the athletics powerhouses, Kenya can only look forward with glee to the opening ceremony of the inaugural edition in Budapest.

As usual, our athletes will be among the 400 in contention; nonetheless, the journey to being part of this group commences now.

 ,"A senior intelligence officer, who police claim died by suicide, reportedly complained about his marital problems, adding that nobody should be blamed for his death.

Tom Adala, an Assistant Director at the National Intelligence Service (NIS) headquarters in Ruaraka, was found dead at his house on Kirichwa Road, Kilimani estate in Nairobi, on Tuesday morning.

A nephew reported to Kilimani police station that Adala shot himself in the head.

The bullet went through the head from the left side and exited from the right. His body was found in the servant’s quarters.

In the main bedroom, police found a black notebook, in which Adala had outlined some of the issues that reportedly led to the suicide.

Rounds and magazines



The book is now with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) office in Kilimani. It is considered a suicide note. The book is the size of a pocket diary.

Sources familiar with the matter told the Nation that Adala had said he faced numerous challenges after separating with his wife. The couple was going through a divorce. Adala was the son of Otuko Adala, Kenya’s first ambassador to Russia from1964 to1968.

The senior Adala also served as the chairman of the Luo Council of Elders. In the last communication to his family through the one-page note, Adala said his children – who live with his estranged wife – should be visiting his grave.

The sources said Adala had shared with colleagues the pain of separating with his wife.

At the tail end of the note dated June 2, which he signed, Adala wrote: “Nobody should be blamed for this.” Adala’s friends and colleagues, who spoke to the Nation in confidence, said he had been battling depression and even sought treatment.



The colleagues said the situation worsened when he was transferred to his new station as the head of the Counter-Extremism Violence Unit during recent staff changes at the NIS headquarters. The transfer, according to friends and workmates, was like a demotion.



“We visited him at home several times when he failed to report to work after the staff changes. Adala wanted to resign but we urged him to stay,” said one senior officer who worked and interacted with him.

According to police, Adala’s nephew said he last saw him on Monday at 10pm when he retired to his room upstairs.

The nephew said he, too, went to bed on the ground floor.

Spent cartridge

He woke up on Tuesday morning, only to be alerted by the househelp that Adala had not shown up for breakfast by 9am.

The nephew said he went to check on his uncle but did not find him. He asked the guard if his uncle had left at night but was told that he had not.

Minutes later, he stumbled on the body at the servant’s quarters. He then called other relatives who informed the police.

Senior police officers who visited the scene found a pistol with a spent cartridge and a magazine with three rounds, according to the police report.

In Adala’s bedroom, a spare magazine was found with 13 rounds. The suicide note was on the bed. It is not clear why no one in the compound heard the gunshot and at what time Adala had moved from the main house.

The body is lying at Lee Funeral Home. Interior Principal Secretary Raymond Omollo mourned Adala as a dedicated officer.

“Adala was a wonderful friend to many,” the PS said in a post on Facebook.

Kenya’s all set to host the 2024 World Kiswahili Day,"Preparations are in top gear for Kenya to host the World Kiswahili Day for the first time this year.

Gender, Culture, the Arts and Heritage Cabinet Secretary Aisha Jumwa yesterday formed a National Organising Committee, comprising 17 members, to arrange for the third World Kiswahili Day celebrations on July 5 to 7.

Key events will include Usiku wa Mswahili, with the climax being the World Kiswahili Day on July 7.

President William Ruto is expected to be the chief guest during the celebrations, whose proposed venue is Mombasa, the minister said.

“Kenya has been granted the opportunity to host this year’s celebrations. We must do the necessary preparations and convince those who proposed our name that they made the right choice,” Ms Jumwa said. “I will ensure funds are made available for everything to run smoothly.”

One of the outcomes of the historic events, the Cabinet secretary said, would be the introduction of a National Kiswahili-Speaking Day.

“There’ll be a special day set aside when every Kenyan, including the President, judges in courts, civil servants and teachers will be expected to speak exclusively in Kiswahili.”

Regional celebrations

During celebrations by the East African Community (EAC) to mark World Kiswahili Day last year, Kenya was named the host of this year’s events.

The second World Kiswahili Day regional celebrations took place in Kampala, Uganda, in 2023.

Zanzibar hosted the inaugural event that was presided over by President Hussein Ali Mwinyi.

That was a year after the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) , sitting in Paris, France, declared July 7 the World Kiswahili Language Day.

On the establishment of the National Kiswahili Council, which has been delayed since the Cabinet gave the nod in 2014, Ms Jumwa said the bill is at an advanced stage. She explained the reasons for the delay.

“It has taken a long after being presented to the Office of the Attorney-General, but that is because the bill has to be translated into Kiswahili,” she said.

“The bill has already been translated into Kiswahili, thanks to Prof Kimani Njogu, who volunteered to do it as a patriotic Kenyan and Kiswahili scholar.

“The council is a requirement by the EAC and Kenya cannot have the Kiswahili Council without the law.”

The EAC Treaty, Article 119, provides for the development and promotion of indigenous languages especially Kiswahili as a lingua franca of the region.

Police yet to crack case of granny’s body found 9 months after death,"One year after detectives opened investigations into the mysterious death of an 82-year-old grandmother, whose body was discovered nine months after she went missing, the findings are inconclusive.

On June 2, last year, at a homestead in Thika's landless estate, crime scene investigators from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) discovered a badly decomposed body.

The home belonged to a widow, Leah Njeri Githua, whose children kept wiring money for upkeep to her mobile phone without checking on her, only for it to later emerge she had been long dead.

The body was lying next to the carcass of a dog.

A further search by the DCI at the home revealed at least 20 dead chicken in the compound.

Homicide investigators were called in to help unravel the mystery death after the shocking discovery.

Natural causes

After an extensive probe by the DCI that went on for close to six months, the investigators have now concluded that it is not possible to establish if Njeri was killed or died of natural causes.

Sources said that investigators have now recommended that the Directorate of Public Prosecutions recommends an inquest into the death of the granny.

A granddaughter of Njeri, who had visited the home, reported that she was missing and could not be reached on her phone.

The investigators combed the homestead for clues and also recorded statements of 10 individuals.

Among those who recorded statements were her children and neighbours. At the time, she was believed to be missing and not dead.

Digging into the family history, investigations revealed that Njeri had been living alone after all her children left home.

Some of the children who are doing well in life, had been sending their mother cash for her upkeep every month. But none of them had visited her for about nine months before she was discovered dead.

At the start of the probe, the investigators picked some bones and clothes believed to belong to Njeri. The samples were taken to the Government Chemist in Nairobi for analysis and DNA testing.

Body parts

Neighbours interviewed told investigators that the last time they had seen Njeri alive was nine months prior to her body being found. They, too, said they were stunned by the recovery of the body parts believed to be her remains.

Also questioned by the detectives is a Nyumba Kumi official who provided insights into what may have transpired.

When the Nation visited the homestead last year, neighbours said they did not think anything amiss even after they failed to see Njeri in the neighbourhood.

“We thought that she had gone to visit one of her sons in the city until we learnt of her death,"" said Michael Njuguna, a neighbour.

Detectives who spoke to the Nation at the start of the investigations said the police were pursuing, among other leads, the possibility that Njeri was killed.

“It is highly likely that whoever killed her was well-known to her, and was aware that the home was not frequented by people. So it was not easy for the body to be discovered,"" a detective said at the time.

Huge sigh of relief as State secures Sh1.2bn vaccines,"The Ministry of Health yesterday announced that routine childhood vaccines worth Sh1.25 billion have been purchased, although some hospitals still reported a shortage.

In a statement, State Department for Medical Services Principal Secretary Harry Kimtai said that the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) had delivered BCG, Oral Polio, Tetanus-Diphtheria and Measles-Rubella vaccines to the country.

An insider at the Health ministry had said that the government had until July 1 to pay Unicef and Gavi a Sh1.5 billion debt for the last financial year, before they could release a fresh consignment of Sh8 billion.

That is the reason why Unicef and Gavi had refused to supply vaccines to Kenya for this financial year.

Read: Drug shortage hits county hospitals

Investigations by the Nation in public health facilities around the country found that they did not have the life-saving vaccines.

As a result, most of the babies born in the last three months have not been vaccinated.

The vaccines that were delivered are 1,209,500 doses for Measles-Rubella, Oral Polio (3,032,000 doses), foretanus-Diphtheri (1,000,000 doses) and BCG (3,129,000 doses).

“The vaccines are being processed for urgent distribution to nine regional vaccine stores across the country. To expedite this process, the Ministry of Health has engaged additional refrigerated trucks to ensure these life-saving vaccines reach our health facilities and communities by the second week of June 2024,” PS Kimtai said.

The government urged healthcare staff to work with community health teams to ensure all children who missed vaccines are up todate in their immunisation schedule.

Jabs available

“We urge all caregivers to take their children back to health facilities for immunization as vaccine supply has now normalised,” he said, adding that the ministry is grateful for the support received from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, that made the jabs available.

“The Ministry of Health is exploring innovative options for sustainable financing of vaccine procurement and programme operations to prevent future stockouts,” Mr Kimtai assured.

At the same time, President William Ruto has said Kenya has formally joined the International Vaccines Institute (IVI) as a state party.

The President said IVI has committed to establish a country and project office in Nairobi, which will be the organisation’s regional headquarters.

This comes after the cost of Covid-19 vaccines pushed many Global South countries, Kenya included, at the back of the queue during the pandemic.

As a result, Kenya decided to manufacture vaccines, biotherapeutics and diagnostics. And in February last year, the country officially presented a letter seeking to join IVI that is based in Seoul, South Korea.

Vaccine nationalism

Speaking during the accession ceremony to the IVI in Seoul, President Ruto said during the Covid-19 pandemic, Kenyans and millions of people on the African continent bore the brunt of arbitrary distribution and denial of access to vaccines. He said there was vaccine nationalism, and the situation was magnified by Africa’s over-reliance on external manufacturers.

“The time has come, therefore, for Africa to actualise health sovereignty by liberating itself from dependency on unsustainable frameworks, and accelerating initiatives to become self-sufficient in vaccine production,” Dr Ruto said.

“A fundamental value of Pan-African solidarity is that no one is free until all people are free,” said, adding that in vaccine supply, no one is safe until everyone is safe.

“Making vaccines universally accessible to all our people, regardless of nationality and status is an urgent imperative that we must respond to,” he added.

The President said that Kenya joining IVI is the culmination of a well-coordinated joint endeavour between the Ministry of Health, the Kenya BioVax Institute, the Kenya Medical Research Institute and experts from IVI.

The Head of State urged developers to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation and enhance support for research and development in biotechnology because that will enable the African continent to take charge and define the future of healthcare.

Technology transfer

“Membership to IVI gives Kenya access to a network for vaccines and technology transfer as we build our internal self-reliance through local manufacturing,” Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha who accompanied President Ruto to South Korea said.



In an interview with the Nation, IVI Director-General Dr Jerome Kim explained that IVI is an international organisation with a mission to discover, develop and deliver safe, effective and affordable vaccines for global health.

“IVF works on diseases that major vaccine companies do not want to work on,” he said, adding that IVI develops vaccine solutions and transfers them to companies that will be the ultimate manufacturers.

“We help these companies to develop and test the vaccine, to secure approvals from local and international regulatory authorities and then work with Gavi, and others to make sure that the vaccines are used and make an impact.

Police yet to crack case of granny’s body found 9 months after death,"One year after detectives opened investigations into the mysterious death of an 82-year-old grandmother, whose body was discovered nine months after she went missing, the findings are inconclusive.

On June 2, last year, at a homestead in Thika's landless estate, crime scene investigators from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) discovered a badly decomposed body.

The home belonged to a widow, Leah Njeri Githua, whose children kept wiring money for upkeep to her mobile phone without checking on her, only for it to later emerge she had been long dead.

The body was lying next to the carcass of a dog.

A further search by the DCI at the home revealed at least 20 dead chicken in the compound.

Homicide investigators were called in to help unravel the mystery death after the shocking discovery.

Natural causes

After an extensive probe by the DCI that went on for close to six months, the investigators have now concluded that it is not possible to establish if Njeri was killed or died of natural causes.

Sources said that investigators have now recommended that the Directorate of Public Prosecutions recommends an inquest into the death of the granny.

A granddaughter of Njeri, who had visited the home, reported that she was missing and could not be reached on her phone.

The investigators combed the homestead for clues and also recorded statements of 10 individuals.

Among those who recorded statements were her children and neighbours. At the time, she was believed to be missing and not dead.

Digging into the family history, investigations revealed that Njeri had been living alone after all her children left home.

Some of the children who are doing well in life, had been sending their mother cash for her upkeep every month. But none of them had visited her for about nine months before she was discovered dead.

At the start of the probe, the investigators picked some bones and clothes believed to belong to Njeri. The samples were taken to the Government Chemist in Nairobi for analysis and DNA testing.

Body parts

Neighbours interviewed told investigators that the last time they had seen Njeri alive was nine months prior to her body being found. They, too, said they were stunned by the recovery of the body parts believed to be her remains.

Also questioned by the detectives is a Nyumba Kumi official who provided insights into what may have transpired.

When the Nation visited the homestead last year, neighbours said they did not think anything amiss even after they failed to see Njeri in the neighbourhood.

“We thought that she had gone to visit one of her sons in the city until we learnt of her death,"" said Michael Njuguna, a neighbour.

Detectives who spoke to the Nation at the start of the investigations said the police were pursuing, among other leads, the possibility that Njeri was killed.

“It is highly likely that whoever killed her was well-known to her, and was aware that the home was not frequented by people. So it was not easy for the body to be discovered,"" a detective said at the time.

"Counties flout law, open 287 bank accounts in 3 months","Counties opened 287 more accounts at commercial banks between December and March this year in continued breach of the law, hurting efforts to boost accountability on how the devolved units spend public funds.

An analysis of official data from the Controller of Budget shows that counties had 1,668 accounts at commercial banks in March from 1,381 at the end of last year.

The devolved units are under the law only allowed to open and maintain bank accounts at the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) for ease of accountability. The only exemption is for imprest accounts for petty cash and revenue collection. The number could be higher given that some such as Nairobi and Mombasa did not disclose the number of accounts they are operating.

Underhand deals

Dr Margaret Nyakango, the Controller of Budget, has on many occasions flagged use of such accounts, on grounds that they are prone to abuse and with a lack of checks, can be used to drive underhand deals using taxpayer funds.

“Key challenges that hampered effective budget execution during the period; use of commercial bank accounts to operate the established public funds and other operational accounts contrary to the regulations,” Dr Nyakango says.

Counties with the most new accounts in the period include Bungoma with 31 bringing its number to 352, Machakos with 26 new ones bringing its tally to 31, and Taita Taveta with 27 new ones to 37 accounts.

But other counties notably, Kwale cut the number of accounts at commercial banks by 102 to have 63 accounts as of March. Makueni closed seven accounts, remaining with 17 in the period.

The Public Finance Management (County Governments) Regulations, 2015 bar regional governments from operating accounts at commercial banks, except those for petty cash and revenue collection. Counties use bank accounts for their car loan and mortgage schemes, debt collection, hospitals, bursaries, and conditional grants.

Track public expenditure

The growing number of bank accounts operated by counties has made it more difficult for the Controller of Budget to track public expenditure. There have been concerns that some of these accounts are used for private dealings with commercial banks, exposing taxpayers to losses and suits. Dr Nyakango recently lost a push to have her office granted real-time access to the bank accounts that counties hold at the CBK.

The CoB had since 2021 been pushing CBK and Treasury to be granted real-time access to the accounts of the counties to curb the inexplicable use of funds.

The failed attempt allows counties to escape scrutiny amid growing concerns of massive corruption in clearing pending bills.

Huge sigh of relief as State secures Sh1.2bn vaccines,"The Ministry of Health yesterday announced that routine childhood vaccines worth Sh1.25 billion have been purchased, although some hospitals still reported a shortage.

In a statement, State Department for Medical Services Principal Secretary Harry Kimtai said that the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) had delivered BCG, Oral Polio, Tetanus-Diphtheria and Measles-Rubella vaccines to the country.

An insider at the Health ministry had said that the government had until July 1 to pay Unicef and Gavi a Sh1.5 billion debt for the last financial year, before they could release a fresh consignment of Sh8 billion.

That is the reason why Unicef and Gavi had refused to supply vaccines to Kenya for this financial year.

Read: Drug shortage hits county hospitals

Investigations by the Nation in public health facilities around the country found that they did not have the life-saving vaccines.

As a result, most of the babies born in the last three months have not been vaccinated.

The vaccines that were delivered are 1,209,500 doses for Measles-Rubella, Oral Polio (3,032,000 doses), foretanus-Diphtheri (1,000,000 doses) and BCG (3,129,000 doses).

“The vaccines are being processed for urgent distribution to nine regional vaccine stores across the country. To expedite this process, the Ministry of Health has engaged additional refrigerated trucks to ensure these life-saving vaccines reach our health facilities and communities by the second week of June 2024,” PS Kimtai said.

The government urged healthcare staff to work with community health teams to ensure all children who missed vaccines are up todate in their immunisation schedule.

Jabs available

“We urge all caregivers to take their children back to health facilities for immunization as vaccine supply has now normalised,” he said, adding that the ministry is grateful for the support received from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, that made the jabs available.

“The Ministry of Health is exploring innovative options for sustainable financing of vaccine procurement and programme operations to prevent future stockouts,” Mr Kimtai assured.

At the same time, President William Ruto has said Kenya has formally joined the International Vaccines Institute (IVI) as a state party.

The President said IVI has committed to establish a country and project office in Nairobi, which will be the organisation’s regional headquarters.

This comes after the cost of Covid-19 vaccines pushed many Global South countries, Kenya included, at the back of the queue during the pandemic.

As a result, Kenya decided to manufacture vaccines, biotherapeutics and diagnostics. And in February last year, the country officially presented a letter seeking to join IVI that is based in Seoul, South Korea.

Vaccine nationalism

Speaking during the accession ceremony to the IVI in Seoul, President Ruto said during the Covid-19 pandemic, Kenyans and millions of people on the African continent bore the brunt of arbitrary distribution and denial of access to vaccines. He said there was vaccine nationalism, and the situation was magnified by Africa’s over-reliance on external manufacturers.

“The time has come, therefore, for Africa to actualise health sovereignty by liberating itself from dependency on unsustainable frameworks, and accelerating initiatives to become self-sufficient in vaccine production,” Dr Ruto said.

“A fundamental value of Pan-African solidarity is that no one is free until all people are free,” said, adding that in vaccine supply, no one is safe until everyone is safe.

“Making vaccines universally accessible to all our people, regardless of nationality and status is an urgent imperative that we must respond to,” he added.

The President said that Kenya joining IVI is the culmination of a well-coordinated joint endeavour between the Ministry of Health, the Kenya BioVax Institute, the Kenya Medical Research Institute and experts from IVI.

The Head of State urged developers to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation and enhance support for research and development in biotechnology because that will enable the African continent to take charge and define the future of healthcare.

Technology transfer

“Membership to IVI gives Kenya access to a network for vaccines and technology transfer as we build our internal self-reliance through local manufacturing,” Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha who accompanied President Ruto to South Korea said.



In an interview with the Nation, IVI Director-General Dr Jerome Kim explained that IVI is an international organisation with a mission to discover, develop and deliver safe, effective and affordable vaccines for global health.

“IVF works on diseases that major vaccine companies do not want to work on,” he said, adding that IVI develops vaccine solutions and transfers them to companies that will be the ultimate manufacturers.

“We help these companies to develop and test the vaccine, to secure approvals from local and international regulatory authorities and then work with Gavi, and others to make sure that the vaccines are used and make an impact.

 ,"What would you say is the single most common fault on cars in Kenya?

Bald tyres? Bad brakes? Smokey exhausts? Oil leaks? Worn suspension bushes? Steering play? Rust? Leaky radiators? Wonky wheel alignment? All of these weaknesses are much more numerous than they should be, but for many years past the Number One error was, and arguably still is, maladjusted headlights.

The blame for this rests with a lack of technical know-how among owners and almost universal negligence by service agents. Most motorists seem to think their headlights are okay as long as both bulbs work, and adjustment checks are rarely a service job-card item.

Read: Car parts you never part with and parts that fall apart

Some (but far from all) recognise that there needs to be a difference between dip and beam. Even fewer seem to realise how exact the power, shape and direction of a headlight beam must be to ensure good visibility without dazzling oncoming traffic.

The design of lights and bulb technology has changed, but the principles have not. Headlights still have four main elements and all four need to be in harmony and very precise.

A man cleans a car's headlights.

One, they have a “housing” which holds the whole lamp assembly in a steady and exact position.

Two, they have a highly polished (chrome) “reflector” which focuses, shapes, and projects the beam of light in a direction and angle that can be (and needs to be) adjusted to within a millimeter at source!

Three, they have a twin-filament “bulb” that determines the potential power of illumination. In days when headlight light bulbs were the shape and size of large golf balls with tungsten filaments in a capsule of argon gas, the legal max for a dip filament was 45 watts and the beam filament was 55 watts. Less than that, and the lights would not adequately illuminate the road ahead; more than that, and the lights would dazzle other road users even if they were correctly adjusted.

Those numbers have been rendered meaningless by the invention and universal availability of quartz halogen, quartz iodine and LED lights capable of many times greater brightness. You have all had to squint at the consequences. Halogen bulbs of up to 130 watts beam power are on open sale, and incorrect “crackdowns” on spotlights have encouraged their use in headlights. Speed bumps, which dramatically alter the angle of light beams, are a horror show.

Four, headlights have a “lens” made of clear glass. This not only protects the reflector and bulb from water, dirt and damage, but is also “riffled” to further steer and shape the beam in a way that helps the driver and doesn’t hinder others. The riffles are specific to left and right headlights and should never be interchanged. Hah!

The reflector is designed to ensure the beam of light is as horizontal as possible. The lens ""riffles"" help shape that horizontal beam in exactly the right direction, up, down and sideways. And the bulb is designed with equal precision of power, size, shape and other features to work in exact harmony with the focal point of the reflector, which then sends beams of light in precise harmony with the lens riffles.

If any of those elements is out of kilter, dazzling lightbeams go every which way, illuminating the road less efficiently and dazzling oncoming traffic.

The correct settings are as follows:

The reflector/lens combination should angle the beams slightly left of and slightly below straight-ahead centre. In the absence of special beam adjustment equipment, there is a home-spun method:

Read: Is it okay to use water instead of coolant?

First, drive the car right up to the wall, and mark the wall exactly opposite the very centre of each headlight. Then reverse until the front of the car is 7.5 metres (approx 25ft) away from the wall. Turn on the lights. The central and brightest part of the beam should be 20 cms below and 20 cms to the left of the marks on the wall, and both at exactly the same height as each other.

Photo credit: Shutterstock

If this pattern cannot be achieved within the range of the adjusting screws, then one or more of the main parts - housing, reflector, bulb and lens - is damaged, or the wrong part, or incorrectly fitted.

The sensible rationale for headlamps is to have lights of the correct power, correctly adjusted, with the correct use of dip and beam, so everybody can see properly without dazzling anyone else. Instead, motorists are fitting more and more powerful bulbs and using full-time full-beam with a mad “self-defence” mentality that is both lunatic and lethal. Dazzling a car that is dazzling you does not solve the problem. It doubles it.

We must somehow start to reverse the vicious circle, and here's a thought which might help start the remedial process:

In a head-on collision, BOTH drivers die.

‘Magic’ additives: a mixed blessing or a mind game?

Coolant additives inhibit rust, reduce the accumulation of dirt and lubricate the water pump.
Photo credit: Shutterstock

Many supermarket shelves are laden with all sorts of fancy “additives” and “treatments” to make car engines go better and last longer. Do they really help?

Skeptic.

The benefit of most of these concoctions to a standard car in good condition that is properly and regularly serviced is somewhere between little and nothing. All the ingredients necessary to achieve the “magic” results they claim already exist in the modern fuels and oils you use.

Where they might make a measurable difference (as a one-off rectifier, not as a constant ingredient) is to help rectify poor conditions caused by severe neglect of basic service routines, which have allowed deposits of carbon or other detritus to build up and harden. In this case, “flushing” compounds might provide some remedy but probably not a “cure”, and can be worth using (carefully and conservatively) to delay a more thorough dismantling and overhaul.

The one treatment that is worth using regularly (always) is coolant additives for the radiator, because they do things that plain water does not: they inhibit rust, reduce accumulation of dirt and lubricate the water pump. Their anti-freeze quality (glycol) is real enough, but irrelevant in our climate unless you regularly park your car above the snowline on Mt Kenya.

Wax polishes

The effectiveness of wax polishes for the paintwork is also “real”, but their use should be occasional. Regular (daily?) washing should use plenty of plain water. Only. Where stubborn dirt demands the use of soap, this will remove both the dirt…and the wax…which will then need to be reapplied (too often).

The most common service error in engines is poor procedure at oil changes. The old oil should be drained when the engine is hot and all the impurities are thoroughly churned up. That way the old oil will drain rapidly and all the dirt will depart with it. If the engine is cold when the drain plug is opened, more dirt will have settled as a sediment and the outflow will be slower and leave more dirt behind.

This means the new oil will immediately mix with old pollutants, and if this incorrect procedure is repeated a few times the impurities will start to clog and be “cooked” into a sticky cake. If new oil becomes dark very soon after an oil change, this indicates residual dirt and using an engine flushing oil before the next refill might be worthwhile…if that process, too, is done right. This is not recommended as a regular service procedure. It is a once-or-twice in lifetime option.

You are right to be skeptical about “performance” additives that promise to turn your family car into a Ferrari. There is only one thing that does that: buy a Ferrari.

FIVB Foundation will push the sport’s popularity across the world,"Last week, the global volleyball community witnessed a landmark event at the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) Headquarters in Lausanne - the launch of the FIVB Volleyball Foundation.

The launch of the FIVB Volleyball Foundation saw FIVB President Dr Ary Graca mark yet another milestone in line with his campaign promise of “innovation and opportunity” when he first assumed office in 2012.

The FIVB Volleyball Foundation, which seeks to use the global reach and power of volleyball to support community projects worldwide that have a positive impact, now completes a trilogy that Dr Graca envisioned back in 2012 that also features the FIVB, which is the administrative arm, and Volleyball World - the commercial arm launched back in 2021.

While forming the Foundation, Graca’s vision was to help the global volleyball fraternity realise the social power of the sport in line with FIVB Goal Number 9, which is to make volleyball the number one sport that serves family needs through social development and humanitarian programmes.

By identifying pioneering projects from across the globe, the Foundation will support and provide funding and resources to advance certified projects that promote the social well-being of communities through volleyball.

Two projects were selected as pilot projects for the Foundation - the Brahmaputra Volleyball League (BVL) in India and the Githurai Volleyball Kimbo Academy in Kenya.

While BVL boasts over 4,000 boys and girls who participate in their leagues across Assam state in India, Githurai Kimbo Academy is home to 96 kids, with Kenyan international Brian Kamonde as one of its shining beneficiaries.

The BVL has helped break cultural stereotypes and inspire hope among children from humble backgrounds to pursue their dreams. Another significant impact of the league is how it brought together communities.

Hub for volleyball talent

The BVL has become a source of pride for the people of Assam, who come out in large numbers to support their teams.

Githurai Kimbo, on the other hand, is run by current and former Githurai Kimbo Volleyball Club players, who serve as volunteer coaches supported by partners such as Lily Academy, a private school located in Githurai.

The academy teaches volleyball and life skills and provides education support as a pathway to a brighter future.

Dreaded for its reputation for organised crime and other social vices, Githurai has recently emerged as a hub for volleyball talent, thanks to Githurai Kimbo Volleyball Academy.

Some of its notable beneficiaries include middle blockers Kamonde and Josphat Muchai, who play for top-tier clubs Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Defence Forces, as well as Strathmore University’s men’s team libero Peter Kamau.

It’s amazing how these two projects use diverse means to arrive at the same goal - empowering communities through volleyball.

In his speech, Graca emphasised the need for The Foundation to also increase mass participation in the sport, citing the innate ability of volleyball to unite people.

“The Volleyball Foundation will play a vital role in promoting positive social values, helping to create a more collaborative and harmonious world,” said Graca, who is also the FIVB Foundation President.

Promoting social projects

“The Foundation is dedicated to creating a world where everyone has access to sport, no matter their gender, age, background or position. Where they have the opportunity to be healthy and active. To experience the joys of volleyball. And to learn important skills that will serve them throughout their lives.”

With an initial CHF 559,000 (Sh78 million) raised during the launch to get the Foundation up and running, and a strong leadership cast of former Russian international Elizaveta Bracht as Executive Director and volleyball legends Mireya Luis, Vladimir Grbic and Gilberto “Giba” Godoy as ambassadors, all signs point towards a well-run Foundation that could be a game-changer for volleyball in terms of popularity all over the world.

Volleyball is the fourth most popular sport globally, with more than 800 million fans. Moving forward, the Foundation will not only help the global volleyball community connect better but also ensure that volleyball rivals sports such as football in terms of community engagement.

As announced by Graça, FIVB plans to allocate an annual budget of CHF 1 million (Sh145 million) for the Volleyball Foundation in 2025 and 2026, pending the approval of the FIVB World Congress later this year.

This solid budget will allow the Foundation to expand its global reach in terms of the social projects it supports.

Key supporters of the Volleyball Foundation include renowned organisations KITT & KISS, Mikasa, Decathlon, the Qatar Foundation, Generations for Peace and the Jordan Olympic Committee, which means the provision of basic equipment such as balls and nets to various social projects will not be a problem.

By promoting social projects all over the world, the Foundation will bring volleyball to the doorstep of various homes, ensuring that volleyball is one of the few sports that young children make first contact with while growing up.

Given the flexible nature of volleyball as a sport, which means it can be played anywhere (sand, concrete, tarmac or cemented surface) and in the tiniest of spaces, this could translate to mass participation in the sport, which will boost its popularity and catapult it into the top three - another legacy to remember Dr Graca with as he enters the homestretch of his 12-year term.

The church vows that healed my lifetime shame and a husband who saw my beauty beyond fistula,"November 4, 2023, will forever be etched in the mind of Mary Nthenya Wambua. On this day, her husband of 25 years, Comas Wambua, officially married her in a church ceremony, fulfilling a desire she had longed for over decades.

Mary walked down the aisle at Mwaani Catholic Church in Makueni County, radiantly tying the knot with the love of her life. The flowing white wedding dress moved gracefully as she made her way down the aisle on that bright, sunny morning.

What made this memory even more joyous was that the wedding fulfilled a promise her husband had made when he first married her 26 years ago.

Mary was born with obstetric fistula, a condition she battled until undergoing successful surgery last year. Fistula is a devastating childbirth injury that creates a hole between the birth canal and bladder or rectum, causing uncontrollable leakage of urine or faeces.

Unlike most cases of obstetric fistula caused by obstructed and prolonged labour, Mary's condition was congenital, existing from birth. While often hereditary, congenital fistulas can also result from actions or exposures during pregnancy or childbirth.

When her husband initially married her, he vowed to stand by her and support her despite her condition, promising to honour her with a church wedding once she was healed.

When nation.africa visits their home in the rural village of Kyamsoi about 70 kilometres from Wote town, Mary vividly recounted the excitement of exchanging vows with her husband on that bright, sunny morning.

""This is what I had been praying for all my adult life. It was the happiest day. The man who married me in my youth, despite my shortcomings, wed me in church in broad daylight in front of God and man. I was so humbled by his love for me,"" she says, beaming with joy.

However, beneath her radiant smile lay a tough journey spanning nearly five decades as she battled with obstetric fistula. Mary opens up about the pain and challenges, citing stigma as one of the worst aspects. Her lowest moment came when she was unable to receive an education due to her condition.

""The condition made me drop out of school so early,"" Mary explains sombrely.

""When my parents took me, the teachers chased me away, fearing I would infect the other pupils. The embarrassment was unbearable.""

She vividly recalls the taunts and ridicule she faced, as her incontinence led to accidents during her menstrual cycle.

""I was the laughing stock of the school. They nicknamed me 'Kinungi', meaning 'the woman who always smells',"" she says, her eyes clouding with the memory.

Unable to cope with the stigma, Mary dropped out of primary school in Class Four. She attempted to continue her education at a local polytechnic, hoping for a more understanding environment. However, the same cruel fate awaited her there.

""My fellow students belittled and side-lined me. At lunchtime, I was always served food in isolation, as they claimed I smelled of urine. I had no friends and was always alone,"" she recalls, the pain still evident decades later.

At age 20, Mary's life took a turn when she moved to Nairobi to live with her supportive brother, the only person who truly understood and loved her unconditionally despite her condition. It was here that she met her future husband. Initially hesitant to pursue a relationship due to her fistula, she eventually accepted his marriage proposal after he assured her of his unconditional acceptance and love.

However, navigating married life with fistula was far from easy.

""The pregnancy periods were the most difficult,"" Mary confides.

""Carrying a child while battling fistula is an incredibly challenging experience, both physically and emotionally."" As a result, after having two children, Mary made the difficult decision to never give birth again, undergoing a tubal ligation procedure.

For years, her parents had desperately sought a cure, consulting witchdoctors and performing rituals in the belief that her condition was caused by a generational curse or witchcraft. However, no traditional interventions provided relief. The persistent incontinence and stigma took a heavy toll, leaving Mary on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Turning point

Her turning point finally came in March 2022, when she underwent successful fistula surgery at the Makueni County Referral Hospital.

Mary's triumphant story mirrors that of many others in the county, after the government introduced fistula care services in partnership with Jhpiego, a non-profit organisation affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.

""That surgery was life-changing,"" Mary says, her eyes shining with gratitude.

""After living with this condition for so long, I finally felt whole again. The weight of shame and stigma was lifted off my shoulders.""

Post-surgery, Mary confidently returned to church and social settings she had avoided for most of her adult life while fighting stigma.

According to Dr Doris Mbithi, an obstetrician-gynaecologist and fistula surgeon heading the Makueni Fistula Care Unit, hundreds of women have been screened, and many have undergone fistula repair surgeries since the unit's inception in March 2022.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Country Director, Anders Thomsen, emphasises the need for advocacy and awareness to prevent and treat this preventable condition.

""Fistula is a tragic but avoidable injury that robs women of their dignity and quality of life,"" he states. ""We must continue raising awareness, dispelling stigma, and ensuring all women have access to quality maternal healthcare.""

Thomsen calls on affected women to seek help and advocates for preventive care through timely hospital referrals and professional birth attendants.

""By empowering women with knowledge and resources, we can stop fistulas before they occur, and provide life-changing treatment for those already suffering,"" he adds.

The Makueni County government has made strides in addressing the issue, prioritising hospital deliveries to reduce the risk of obstetric fistulas. However, with only about 10 fistula surgeons available nationwide, access to fistula care remains limited across Kenya. Efforts are underway to train more surgeons and develop routine fistula management in all 47 counties by 2030.

""We have developed a comprehensive training package to equip more doctors with the skills needed to perform fistula repair surgeries,"" explains Dr Karen Aura, the fistula lead at the Reproductive and Maternal Health Division at the Ministry of Health.

""Our goal is to have fistula care integrated into routine maternal health services across the country.""

While commending Makueni County's efforts, the head of the Reproductive and Maternal Health division, Edward Serem, challenges other counties to prioritise fistula prevention.

""The most sustainable way to address fistulas is to prevent them from happening in the first place,"" he states. ""This requires developing the capacity of medical professionals, retaining them in their areas, and strengthening primary healthcare and referral systems.""

As for Mary, her long-awaited church wedding marked the beginning of a new chapter, free from the shackles of fistula and stigma.

""That day, I felt like a true bride – beautiful, loved, and complete,"" she says, her radiant smile a testament to her resilience and the power of hope.

""My husband's unwavering love and support carried me through the darkest of times, and now, we can truly embrace the future together.""

 ,"What would you say is the single most common fault on cars in Kenya?

Bald tyres? Bad brakes? Smokey exhausts? Oil leaks? Worn suspension bushes? Steering play? Rust? Leaky radiators? Wonky wheel alignment? All of these weaknesses are much more numerous than they should be, but for many years past the Number One error was, and arguably still is, maladjusted headlights.

The blame for this rests with a lack of technical know-how among owners and almost universal negligence by service agents. Most motorists seem to think their headlights are okay as long as both bulbs work, and adjustment checks are rarely a service job-card item.

Read: Car parts you never part with and parts that fall apart

Some (but far from all) recognise that there needs to be a difference between dip and beam. Even fewer seem to realise how exact the power, shape and direction of a headlight beam must be to ensure good visibility without dazzling oncoming traffic.

The design of lights and bulb technology has changed, but the principles have not. Headlights still have four main elements and all four need to be in harmony and very precise.

A man cleans a car's headlights.

One, they have a “housing” which holds the whole lamp assembly in a steady and exact position.

Two, they have a highly polished (chrome) “reflector” which focuses, shapes, and projects the beam of light in a direction and angle that can be (and needs to be) adjusted to within a millimeter at source!

Three, they have a twin-filament “bulb” that determines the potential power of illumination. In days when headlight light bulbs were the shape and size of large golf balls with tungsten filaments in a capsule of argon gas, the legal max for a dip filament was 45 watts and the beam filament was 55 watts. Less than that, and the lights would not adequately illuminate the road ahead; more than that, and the lights would dazzle other road users even if they were correctly adjusted.

Those numbers have been rendered meaningless by the invention and universal availability of quartz halogen, quartz iodine and LED lights capable of many times greater brightness. You have all had to squint at the consequences. Halogen bulbs of up to 130 watts beam power are on open sale, and incorrect “crackdowns” on spotlights have encouraged their use in headlights. Speed bumps, which dramatically alter the angle of light beams, are a horror show.

Four, headlights have a “lens” made of clear glass. This not only protects the reflector and bulb from water, dirt and damage, but is also “riffled” to further steer and shape the beam in a way that helps the driver and doesn’t hinder others. The riffles are specific to left and right headlights and should never be interchanged. Hah!

The reflector is designed to ensure the beam of light is as horizontal as possible. The lens ""riffles"" help shape that horizontal beam in exactly the right direction, up, down and sideways. And the bulb is designed with equal precision of power, size, shape and other features to work in exact harmony with the focal point of the reflector, which then sends beams of light in precise harmony with the lens riffles.

If any of those elements is out of kilter, dazzling lightbeams go every which way, illuminating the road less efficiently and dazzling oncoming traffic.

The correct settings are as follows:

The reflector/lens combination should angle the beams slightly left of and slightly below straight-ahead centre. In the absence of special beam adjustment equipment, there is a home-spun method:

Read: Is it okay to use water instead of coolant?

First, drive the car right up to the wall, and mark the wall exactly opposite the very centre of each headlight. Then reverse until the front of the car is 7.5 metres (approx 25ft) away from the wall. Turn on the lights. The central and brightest part of the beam should be 20 cms below and 20 cms to the left of the marks on the wall, and both at exactly the same height as each other.

If this pattern cannot be achieved within the range of the adjusting screws, then one or more of the main parts - housing, reflector, bulb and lens - is damaged, or the wrong part, or incorrectly fitted.

The sensible rationale for headlamps is to have lights of the correct power, correctly adjusted, with the correct use of dip and beam, so everybody can see properly without dazzling anyone else. Instead, motorists are fitting more and more powerful bulbs and using full-time full-beam with a mad “self-defence” mentality that is both lunatic and lethal. Dazzling a car that is dazzling you does not solve the problem. It doubles it.

We must somehow start to reverse the vicious circle, and here's a thought which might help start the remedial process:

In a head-on collision, BOTH drivers die.

‘Magic’ additives: a mixed blessing or a mind game?

Coolant additives inhibit rust, reduce the accumulation of dirt and lubricate the water pump.

Many supermarket shelves are laden with all sorts of fancy “additives” and “treatments” to make car engines go better and last longer. Do they really help?

Skeptic.

The benefit of most of these concoctions to a standard car in good condition that is properly and regularly serviced is somewhere between little and nothing. All the ingredients necessary to achieve the “magic” results they claim already exist in the modern fuels and oils you use.

Where they might make a measurable difference (as a one-off rectifier, not as a constant ingredient) is to help rectify poor conditions caused by severe neglect of basic service routines, which have allowed deposits of carbon or other detritus to build up and harden. In this case, “flushing” compounds might provide some remedy but probably not a “cure”, and can be worth using (carefully and conservatively) to delay a more thorough dismantling and overhaul.

The one treatment that is worth using regularly (always) is coolant additives for the radiator, because they do things that plain water does not: they inhibit rust, reduce accumulation of dirt and lubricate the water pump. Their anti-freeze quality (glycol) is real enough, but irrelevant in our climate unless you regularly park your car above the snowline on Mt Kenya.

Wax polishes

The effectiveness of wax polishes for the paintwork is also “real”, but their use should be occasional. Regular (daily?) washing should use plenty of plain water. Only. Where stubborn dirt demands the use of soap, this will remove both the dirt…and the wax…which will then need to be reapplied (too often).

The most common service error in engines is poor procedure at oil changes. The old oil should be drained when the engine is hot and all the impurities are thoroughly churned up. That way the old oil will drain rapidly and all the dirt will depart with it. If the engine is cold when the drain plug is opened, more dirt will have settled as a sediment and the outflow will be slower and leave more dirt behind.

This means the new oil will immediately mix with old pollutants, and if this incorrect procedure is repeated a few times the impurities will start to clog and be “cooked” into a sticky cake. If new oil becomes dark very soon after an oil change, this indicates residual dirt and using an engine flushing oil before the next refill might be worthwhile…if that process, too, is done right. This is not recommended as a regular service procedure. It is a once-or-twice in lifetime option.

You are right to be skeptical about “performance” additives that promise to turn your family car into a Ferrari. There is only one thing that does that: buy a Ferrari.

FIVB Foundation will push the sport’s popularity across the world,"Last week, the global volleyball community witnessed a landmark event at the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) Headquarters in Lausanne - the launch of the FIVB Volleyball Foundation.

The launch of the FIVB Volleyball Foundation saw FIVB President Dr Ary Graca mark yet another milestone in line with his campaign promise of “innovation and opportunity” when he first assumed office in 2012.

The FIVB Volleyball Foundation, which seeks to use the global reach and power of volleyball to support community projects worldwide that have a positive impact, now completes a trilogy that Dr Graca envisioned back in 2012 that also features the FIVB, which is the administrative arm, and Volleyball World - the commercial arm launched back in 2021.

While forming the Foundation, Graca’s vision was to help the global volleyball fraternity realise the social power of the sport in line with FIVB Goal Number 9, which is to make volleyball the number one sport that serves family needs through social development and humanitarian programmes.

By identifying pioneering projects from across the globe, the Foundation will support and provide funding and resources to advance certified projects that promote the social well-being of communities through volleyball.

Two projects were selected as pilot projects for the Foundation - the Brahmaputra Volleyball League (BVL) in India and the Githurai Volleyball Kimbo Academy in Kenya.

While BVL boasts over 4,000 boys and girls who participate in their leagues across Assam state in India, Githurai Kimbo Academy is home to 96 kids, with Kenyan international Brian Kamonde as one of its shining beneficiaries.

The BVL has helped break cultural stereotypes and inspire hope among children from humble backgrounds to pursue their dreams. Another significant impact of the league is how it brought together communities.

Hub for volleyball talent

The BVL has become a source of pride for the people of Assam, who come out in large numbers to support their teams.

Githurai Kimbo, on the other hand, is run by current and former Githurai Kimbo Volleyball Club players, who serve as volunteer coaches supported by partners such as Lily Academy, a private school located in Githurai.

The academy teaches volleyball and life skills and provides education support as a pathway to a brighter future.

Dreaded for its reputation for organised crime and other social vices, Githurai has recently emerged as a hub for volleyball talent, thanks to Githurai Kimbo Volleyball Academy.

Some of its notable beneficiaries include middle blockers Kamonde and Josphat Muchai, who play for top-tier clubs Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Defence Forces, as well as Strathmore University’s men’s team libero Peter Kamau.

It’s amazing how these two projects use diverse means to arrive at the same goal - empowering communities through volleyball.

In his speech, Graca emphasised the need for The Foundation to also increase mass participation in the sport, citing the innate ability of volleyball to unite people.

“The Volleyball Foundation will play a vital role in promoting positive social values, helping to create a more collaborative and harmonious world,” said Graca, who is also the FIVB Foundation President.

Promoting social projects

“The Foundation is dedicated to creating a world where everyone has access to sport, no matter their gender, age, background or position. Where they have the opportunity to be healthy and active. To experience the joys of volleyball. And to learn important skills that will serve them throughout their lives.”

With an initial CHF 559,000 (Sh78 million) raised during the launch to get the Foundation up and running, and a strong leadership cast of former Russian international Elizaveta Bracht as Executive Director and volleyball legends Mireya Luis, Vladimir Grbic and Gilberto “Giba” Godoy as ambassadors, all signs point towards a well-run Foundation that could be a game-changer for volleyball in terms of popularity all over the world.

Volleyball is the fourth most popular sport globally, with more than 800 million fans. Moving forward, the Foundation will not only help the global volleyball community connect better but also ensure that volleyball rivals sports such as football in terms of community engagement.

As announced by Graça, FIVB plans to allocate an annual budget of CHF 1 million (Sh145 million) for the Volleyball Foundation in 2025 and 2026, pending the approval of the FIVB World Congress later this year.

This solid budget will allow the Foundation to expand its global reach in terms of the social projects it supports.

Key supporters of the Volleyball Foundation include renowned organisations KITT & KISS, Mikasa, Decathlon, the Qatar Foundation, Generations for Peace and the Jordan Olympic Committee, which means the provision of basic equipment such as balls and nets to various social projects will not be a problem.

By promoting social projects all over the world, the Foundation will bring volleyball to the doorstep of various homes, ensuring that volleyball is one of the few sports that young children make first contact with while growing up.

Given the flexible nature of volleyball as a sport, which means it can be played anywhere (sand, concrete, tarmac or cemented surface) and in the tiniest of spaces, this could translate to mass participation in the sport, which will boost its popularity and catapult it into the top three - another legacy to remember Dr Graca with as he enters the homestretch of his 12-year term.

"Don’t vilify muguka, says AG Justin Muturi on controversial crop","Attorney-General Justin Muturi has waded into the raging controversy over the muguka and miraa trade amid sustained pressure by Coast counties to curtail their sale, if not ban them altogether.

Insisting that the crops should not be vilified, Mr Muturi said Kenyans should appreciate the value of muguka and miraa to the people of Embu.

“Let us not try to demonise muguka before we have full scientific facts about it,” the attorney-general said at the Kenya School of Government in Embu during the launch of the Fourth Medium Term Plan 2023-2027.

The official said that the issues that pertain to the muguka trade need a lot of consultation with the views of all stakeholders taken into consideration. He added that the matter has not been brought to him, as the State’s legal advisor, to address it.

""This matter has not found its way to me, when it does, I will look into it,"" he said

However, he commended the entire Embu leadership, led by Governor Cecily Mbarire, for their stand on muguka.

Read: What the science says about muguka

Muguka farming has for many years been a critical economic activity for residents of Embu, especially in the expansive and semi-arid Mbeere sub-region.

The recent ban imposed on its sale, transportation and distribution in Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi counties has dealt the residents a devastating blow.

Records obtained from the Embu County Government indicate that at least 65,000 residents are engaged in muguka farming.

Coast counties are the biggest markets for the stimulant.

Dry seasons

One kilogramme of muguka retails at between Sh300 and Sh600, with prices topping Sh1,000 per kilo during the dry seasons.

Local residents together with their leaders have dismissed claims by its antagonists at the coast that muguka is a harmful drug that causes impotency, mental illness and disability.

Read: Muguka: Embu County’s Sh22bn-a-year cash cow

They insisted that muguka and miraa are scheduled crops that are protected under the law.

Ms Mbarire revealed that her administration together with the County Assembly of Embu have engaged their legal teams to defend muguka farmers.

She explained that the botanical name for miraa is catha edulis and the active ingredient is called carthinone.

She added that there is no law distinguishing between miraa and muguka nor prohibiting their sale or consumption.

“Muguka is not a drug; it is a popular variety of miraa which is more affordable and whose carthinone levels are higher than the traditional miraa,"" the governor stated.

Ms Mbarire further pointed out that the muguka business engages the people of Embu largely as farmers, with those from Meru and other areas in Central Kenya being middlemen and transporters.

The muguka value chain is estimated to contribute to approximately Sh22 billion per year to the economy of Embu.

Muguka farmers, together with other players who have invested heavily in the muguka value chain, stand to lose a lot in terms of revenue and livelihoods.

Sh10.8 million i

Farmers deliver 36 tonnes of muguka to Mombasa every day, earning the county Sh10.8 million in transport levies.

Ms Mbarire said leaders at the coast have refused to meet with their Embu counterparts to discuss the matter.

“Now that the coast leaders don't want to meet us to discuss about muguka, we are waiting the final word from President William Ruto,"" said Ms Mbarire.

Kiambeere MCA Lenny Masters Mwaniki told the coast governors to respect the rule of law.

""Muguka is not an outlawed crop, and the ban imposed on it by coast governors is null and void,"" Mr Mwaniki said.

"University of Nairobi rises into top 1,000 global varsity rankings","The University of Nairobi (UoN) has moved into the top 1,000 universities in the world in the QS World University Rankings 2025, continuing an upward trend in international post-secondary institutional standings.

The institution was ranked in the 909-950 band in a pool of 1,500 published international institutions, up from the 1,000-1,200 band it has held since 2022.

The UoN’s improved ranking this year is a result of gains in key categories including employment outcomes, academic reputation, international research and faculty-student ratio.

The institution's highest ranking indicator was employment outcomes, which increased by 92.5 percent and was placed in the 251-300 band. Academic reputation increased slightly from 9.6 percent in 2023 to 10 percent currently.

Reputation category

In the employer reputation category, a metric that assesses employers' perceptions of post-secondary graduates, the UoN recorded a 2.9 percent drop to 11.7 percent, down from 14.6 percent last year.

“However, the institution saw an improvement in the ranking of citations per faculty, which stood at 20.1 percent and positioned itself in the 1,051-1,100 range. This indicator is based on a ratio measuring the average number of citations per faculty member,” the data shows.

The UoN is home to many researchers, some of whom are among the world's most highly cited in fields such as health sciences.

In the category of international research networks, the university scored an average of 50.1 percent, an indicator that assesses the richness and diversity of an institution's research partnerships.

The lowest scoring indicator was sustainability, with 1.8 percent, despite being one of the leading institutions charting the course and driving change towards a more sustainable future.

Last year, UoN was ranked 1,425 out of 2,000 institutions by the Centre for World University Ranking, the only Kenyan university listed.

Employment outcomes

Kenyatta University, which joined the rankings last year, has maintained its position in the 1,201-1,400 range, with employment outcomes being the highest indicator.

Regionally, South Africa holds the top four positions on the African continent, with the University of Cape Town the continent's highest-ranked institution at 171, up two places from last year.

Cairo University in Egypt completes the top five in Africa, ranking 350 globally.

Globally, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology held the top spot for the thirteenth year, while Imperial College London moved up to second place.

The University of Oxford and Harvard University are ranked third and fourth respectively. The University of Cambridge completes the top five.

This global ranking is the first to include both sustainability and employability factors as key measures in its methodology.

Since the 2024 ranking, the group has added a five percent weighting to sustainability to reflect the crucial role universities play in setting the course and driving change towards a more sustainable future.

"Parastatal reforms split PSC, State House teams","The Public Service Commission (PSC) has told off the Executive Office of the President over new guidelines on the management of parastatals, pointing to a simmering struggle over control of the State-owned entities that manage billions of shillings.

PSC chairperson Anthony Muchiri has termed Executive Order No. 3 of 2024 on Guidelines for the Management of State Corporations as illegal and unconstitutional for excluding the commission from their formulation.

The executive order gazetted by President William Ruto on May 24 provides for, among others, terms and conditions of service for boards and human resource management of State corporations.

Dr Ruto directed that the new guidelines “shall and do supersede the Guidelines issued in November 2004”.

State House’s Chief of Staff & Head of the Public Service Felix Koskei launched the guidelines on Tuesday at Bomas of Kenya at a meeting attended by chairpersons and CEOs of State Corporations, vice chancellors of public universities, and other government agencies.

The Business Daily has, however, established that Mr Muchiri had warned Mr Koskei against rolling out the guidelines, insisting that State corporations and public universities were part of public service and that their management is constitutionally under the PSC.

“The Guidelines are in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution and are, therefore, invalid pursuant to the provisions of Article 2(4) of the Constitution…,” Mr Muchiri wrote in a letter to Mr Koskei on May 28.

“The guidelines violate several court decisions that found that it is only the Commission (PSC) that has the power to establish offices and approve human resource instruments in the public service.”

Article 2(4) provides that “any law, including customary law, that is inconsistent with the Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency, and any act or omission in contravention of this Constitution is invalid”.



The PSC says the authors of the Guidelines relied on and made reference to Sections 5(3) and 27 of the State Corporations Act which have both “been found to be unconstitutional for violating the constitutional mandate of the Commission as provided in Article 234 of the Constitution”.

Article 234 gives the PSC powers over the functioning of public service entities, excluding those for State officers, Ambassadors, High Commissioners and consular representatives. Other offices where the PSC has no powers are those under the Parliamentary Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission, Teachers Service Commission, National Service Commission and County Public Service.

“State Corporations and public universities are part of the public service,” Mr Muchiri says.

“This is an issue that has been litigated and determined by courts several times, including in a most recent Court of Appeal decision on April 27, 2024, in … Civil Appeal No 156 of 2016 between Salaries and Remuneration Commission and National Hospital [sic] Insurance Fund and two others.”

Read: Treasury to take over more than 40 parastatals in changes

The gazettement of the revised guidelines for the management of parastatals was preceded by a Cabinet resolution of April 23 that followed a directive by Dr Ruto on fiscal consolidation and management of State corporations.

“The new policy also aligns the determination of the terms and conditions of service in the agencies with the provisions of the Constitution and the relevant laws,” a dispatch from the Ruto-chaired Cabinet read in part. “Consequently, the revised guidelines will provide salary bands and allowances for CEOs, board members, Vice-Chancellors, Chancellors and members of university councils.”

The Cabinet further resolved that the Salaries and Remunerations Commission and the State Corporations Advisory Committee will be key players in determining the terms and conditions for State corporations.

“The Commission was not consulted during the generation of the guidelines. It is recommended that a stakeholder meeting be urgently constituted to address the constitutional and legal implications highlighted in the instant advisory,” Mr Muchiri says in the letter.

Earlier on March 26, Dr Ruto met the chairperson and chief executives where he directed them to cut their recurrent budgets for the year starting July by at least a third.

“We will shut them [loss-making State corporations] down, we will get their employees to go and work somewhere else and at least we will stop making the losses,” Dr Ruto warned.

“And I want some of those institutions to volunteer [to close down]. Some of them should start telling us,' Please close our institutions and assign us other jobs' so that Kenyans stop losing money.”

A day later on March 27, the Treasury issued a circular that made it clear that entities identified for mergers and winding up will get minimal budgetary allocation for the year starting July.

The financial risks associated with struggling parastatals amounted to Sh1.24 trillion by the end of the last financial year in June 2023.

These include Sh145.4 billion in guaranteed loans, Sh111.80 billion in non-guaranteed loans and Sh983.20 billion on-lent loans.

Olunga: Cote d’Ivoire not in our minds for now,"Harambee Stars captain Michael Olunga has warned his teammates against complacency when they face Burundi’s Swallows in a Group 'F' 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi on Friday.

The match will kick off at 4pm Kenyan time and will be broadcast live on national station KBC.

“We respect Cote d'Ivoire as they are African champions but Burundi is also a tough opponent which we must deal with first,"" said Olunga on phone from Lilongwe on Thursday.

""Everybody is talking about Cote d'Ivoire and underrating Burundi which has the same style of play like us and is strong opponent. We should tackle them with a lot of respect,” he added.

Kenya will face group favourites Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday at the same venue.

Football Kenya Federation moved Harambee Stars' home fixtures to Lilongwe's Bingu stadium is because the only venues that could these international matches were MISC and Nyayo Stadium which are currently closed for renovations.

Impressive run

Incidentally, Malawi will be hosting Sao Tome at the same venue on Thursday in a Group 'H' match.

Olunga said he Kenya will have to be at their best to prevail.

The Al-Duhail marksman added that the Malawians have been hospitable to them.

“We were received well in Malawi and our training has also been well. The team is adequately prepared to face Burundi, we will also be targeting a positive outcome against Cote d’Ivoire,” added the former Gor Mahia man.

Olunga heads into the two matches on the back of an impressive run of seven goals scored in Stars’ last three matches.

The former Gor Mahia and Tusker man scored a brace in their 5-0 World Cup qualifying rout of Seychelles on November 20 in Abidjan.

Olunga then helped himself to five goals in the Four Nations tournament held in Malawi in March where Kenya hammered Malawi 4-0 before thumping Zimbabwe 3-1 in the final on March 26.

Latest Fifa rankings

Midfielder John Ochieng said they will approach the match cautiously but “with a winning mentality”.

According to the latest Fifa rankings, Kenya are placed 33 places above Burundi at 107th.

In their eight meetings, Kenya have won three, Burundi two with three draws.

Stars have since Monday been training at Silver Stadium, which is a 10-minute drive from Bingu National Stadium.

Burkinabe Jean Quattara is the centre referee assisted by compatriots Seydou Tiama (first assistant referee), Habib Oumar Sanou (second assistant referee), and Benoit Bado (fourth official).

Tanzanian Leslie Liunda is the referee assessor while South African Bennett Kenneth Bailey will be the match commissioner.

Regular and VIP tickets will retail at 5,000 Malawian Kwacha (about Sh376) and 20,000 Malawian Kwacha (Sh1,500) respectively, and will be available on match day.

Private sector activity defies floods to grow at fastest pace in 20 months,"Private sector activity in Kenya defied ravaging floods to grow at the fastest pace in more than one and a half years, largely helped by easing inflationary pressures and stabilising shilling, findings of a closely-watched monthly survey suggested Wednesday.

The Stanbic Kenya Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) — a month-on-month measure for private sector activity such as output, new orders, and employment— rose to 51.8 in May from 50.1 a month earlier.

The growth in the PMI index, the sharpest in 20 months, signals increased business in May compared to April. PMI readings above 50 signal growth in private sector business conditions, while levels below that mark, point to a contraction.

The growth in business activity defied the projection by corporate managers of a slowdown in deals following heavy flooding which started late April through last month, disrupting activities in key sectors of transport, education and trade.

The PMI findings, based on feedback from about 400 corporate managers, showed that services, manufacturing wholesale and retail sectors posted expansion in activity despite the flooding.

Farming and construction activities, however, contracted during the month amidst floods which claimed more than 200 lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of persons.

“Private sector activity was surprisingly strong in May, implying a further improvement in economic activity, as we had expected to see some impact from the recent floods,” Christopher Legilisho, an economist with South African-based Standard Bank, the parent firm of Stanbic Bank, wrote in the PMI report. “Output and new orders recorded strong gains in May as firms reported increased consumer demand.”



Inflation, a measure of the increase in the cost of goods and services over the previous year, was largely unchanged in May at 5.1 percent on steading food and energy costs, slightly increased from 5.0 a month earlier.

The shilling, on the other hand, was largely stable, exchanging at 133.28 units against the bullish US dollar at the close of the month compared to 133.80 units at the start — a marginal depreciation of 1.12 percent.

The easing inflationary pressure amidst the strengthening shilling in a net import economy was expected to free up some cash for expenditure.

The shilling, on the other hand, exchanged at an average of 130.23 units against the globally bullish US dollar, a 2.29 percent gain over April.

Read: Business activity rebounds first time since August

The easing inflationary pressures amidst steadying shilling in a net import economy helped cut input costs for the second month running, freeing up cash for firms which enabled them to raise output for the first time since February.

The report further suggests falling inflation helped sales in Kenya’s private sector grow at the strongest rate in nearly one and a half years (since January 2023) in May.

“Encouragingly, input prices fell in May for a second month, with respondents noting a decline in fuel prices and lower imports costs due to a more favourable exchange rate,” Mr Legilisho said. “Meanwhile, output prices increased only slightly. This aligns with our view that inflationary pressures have eased.”

Baby Astra: The chimpanzee born from failed birth control,"At Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary on Ol Pejeta Ranch in Laikipia County, the air is still. A few minutes to mid-day, the 30 chimpanzees that live here call their friends to eat. Among them is baby Astra, the sanctuary’s youngest chimpanzee aged one year and five months. His delivery in 2022 is believed by experts at the sanctuary to have resulted from a failed family planning procedure.

About a year before he was born, the sanctuary had placed contraceptive implants— the same kind that people use to prevent pregnancy— in sexually mature females and conducted vasectomies in mature males to prevent breeding.

Dr Florence Muthoni, the sanctuary’s resident chimpanzee vet, explains that the sanctuary does not breed chimpanzees in obedience to a regulation from Pan Africa Sanctuary Alliance, a regulatory body that governs most sanctuaries in Africa. According to the alliance, rescued chimps in a sanctuary should not be bred due to constrained resources and to avoid creating hybrids.

“We do this because of resources. You do not want to do overbreeding in an area where the chimpanzees are not endemic. This is not their natural habitat. Because there are three sub-species here, you also do not want to create hybrids. Besides, the more you interbreed, the more you create genetic defects,” explains Dr Muthoni.

“Sometimes, just like in humans, our implants fail and the result is that we have a baby. We are taking care of the baby and the mother. The baby is currently weaned off breastfeeding, and we keep him on a healthy diet for optimum growth,” she adds.

The American Association of Zoo Veterinarians advises that while considering contraceptive options, reversibility and safety as well as potential weight gain must be considered when offering hormonal methods. The association notes that implants such as MGA implants and Norplants work by interfering with fertilisation by thickening cervical mucus, interrupting sperm transport and disrupting implantation. It adds that 29 per cent of the female chimpanzees who have utilised solid MGA implants have experienced a four per cent failure rate.

However, it is unclear whether the birth control failure at the Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary resulted from loss of the product or loss in implant efficacy. The association, however, recommends that the implants are routinely checked to ensure they are in place by palpation during training or scanning a transponder microchip placed within the implant.

Even though baby Astra will live his life in a safe environment socialising and playing, his parents and group mates did not have a peaceful start to life. Most of them are survivors of smuggling, bush meat trade, habitat loss from commercial logging and illegal wildlife trade.

Intended to be pets, some were chained up all day while others were confined to tiny cages in various countries. As a result, they lacked muscle development to climb and walk properly. Others were handed over by their owners for lifelong safekeeping after they grew big and uncontrollable. Chimpanzees kept as pets often suffer from both psychological and physical wounds. They frequently adopt unnatural behaviours in captivity such as begging for food by clapping their hands, spitting on people, or pacing due to boredom.

Many of these chimpanzees at the sanctuary still bear scars from encounters with bullets or snares.

Constrained to live in artificial environments, they endure trauma, leading to aggression, depression, or even psychosis.

There are other apes that are often captured in the wild and smuggled to distant locations to serve as entertainment in commercial zoos and safari parks. Their fate, upon ageing, mirrors that of pet chimpanzees.

“This sanctuary started in 1993 through an agreement with Jane Goodall Institute and the Kenya Wildlife Service. The main goal was to rescue chimps who were victims of the civil unrest in Burundi. Other than that, we have chimps that were rescued from smugglers. Some were rescued at JKIA on transit, and a few people have surrendered chimps to us for their life-long care from Iran, Iraq and other countries,” explains Dr Muthoni.

In 1995, another group of nine adult chimpanzees joined the sanctuary, followed by an additional 10 in 1996. Over time, the sanctuary's scope expanded, now accepting chimpanzees rescued from distressing circumstances worldwide. Currently, it protects 30 chimpanzees.

“Immediately they get here, we have a quarantine facility where they stay for three months. We conduct tests, vaccinate them, and try to understand their personality and trauma patterns, which may range from food traumas, where they tend to binge eat, or loud sounds. Caregivers help them address their trauma, and then they are slowly introduced to a group. That also involves a lot of research to know which group they would better fit in and if there is a surrogate mother who can take them in, depending on age and gender.

“Being in a semi-captive facility, they are quite intelligent animals and you have to keep them engaged — keep them doing things they would be naturally doing in the wild such as foraging termite mounds, digging for termites, using sticks, swinging from trees, among others. This can take like a year or two,” she adds.

Every morning, Ms Muthoni and her team leave their campsites and go to the chimpanzee nighttime holding facilities to check on them and ensure they have woken up well. The team then releases them for breakfast and clean their sleeping facilities. The chimps are released into their enclosures, where they spend the rest of their day browsing.

“They come back for lunch at around noon, and then go back again. In the evening, they go back to the holding facility for the night. Chimps in the wild are almost omnivorous like us. They eat meat, fruits and plants. Here, we do mainly fruits and non-meat-based proteins. We also mix eggs with some of their foods, but other than that they eat fruits, vegetables and peanuts. We have also set up termite mounts so they can dig for termites outside.”

Besides serving as a rescue centre, the sanctuary also serves as a platform for raising awareness about chimpanzees in their natural habitats. Unfortunately , the chimps in the sanctuary cannot be reintroduced to the wild. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora has declared wild chimpanzees as threatened and endangered, and in need of utmost protection. This declaration means that it is illegal for chimpanzees to be used for entertainment, to be captured, killed or traded commercially.

Despite efforts to protect them, thousands of great apes vanish from their natural habitats annually due to illegal trade. Conservatively, experts believe that a minimum of 2,000 chimps fall victim to trafficking each year. Shockingly, for every live baby chimp caught up in illegal trade, up to 10 other chimpanzees may have perished in the process.

'Let's disrupt!' How Dr Wanjiru Rutenberg shattered global glass ceilings,"At the tender age of 14, Wanjiru Kamau embarked on a life-changing journey. Her parents, with grand aspirations for their eldest child, made a pivotal decision – to send her to the foreign land of Denver, Colorado, in the United States.

It was a time when winter's chill had enveloped the city, but Wanjiru had no choice but to adapt to her new surroundings.

Her host, an uncle who was a surgeon, promptly enrolled her in a public school, where she experienced a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities.

This exposure and interaction with multiracial student body opened Wanjiru's eyes to the lost opportunities for her people in Africa, particularly in her home country, Kenya. It instilled in her a burning desire to pay it forward.

True to her parents' dreams, Wanjiru did not disappoint. At the age of 30, she returned home as Dr Wanjiru Kamau – and married, taking on the name Dr Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg.

Her accomplishments brought immense joy to her father, a retired electrical engineer from Kenya Airways, and her mother, a former employee of the Teachers Service Commission.

Throughout her higher education journey, Wanjiru was fortunate to receive a scholarship that covered her undergraduate and postgraduate studies. She earned a degree in politics from Whitman College and seamlessly transitioned to the University of Minnesota, where she completed her master's and doctoral degrees in political science.

“I wanted to be a lawyer like Martha Karua.  I also admired James Orengo (Siaya Governor), and (Prof) Anyang’ Nyong’o (Kisumu Governor) who is also a political scientist,” she shares.

However, financial constraints as a foreign student in the US led her to pursue political science, as it offered funding for her doctoral studies.

“Then I wanted to do public policy, and I ran into the same problem.  Then I discovered if I did political science, they would actually pay so long as I told them I was going to get a PhD. If I told them I only needed a Master’s, they would make me pay but if I told them I was signing up for the PhD, they would pay my fees and a monthly stipend to be a teaching assistant.”

But this daughter of Kamau, the man who raised her to know she can do anything in this world, has indeed held high-flying global positions so parallel to her training.

Global initiative

From her role as director at the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (Award), where she expanded its range and diversity of partners, to her position as an executive in-residence at Schmidt Futures, where she designed and built a global initiative for Black women senior leaders, her impact has been far-reaching.

Her work has also extended to several boards and advisory councils of organisations investing in agriculture, climate change, environment, philanthropic work, human development, and social ventures, including the African Climate Foundation, Centre for Development Research, Wangari Maathai Foundation, Bridge Collaborative, and New Economy Venture Accelerator, among others.

In the past four months alone, she has been appointed to significant positions, including a senior fellowship at the Ford Foundation and a seat on the executive board of the global Crop Trust, which implements the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.

I ask her how she cracked it.

Wanjiru attributes it to her curiosity and unwavering determination. ""Political science just gave me a degree. But kuwa kimbelembele na kichwa ngumu (being curious and firm-minded) has landed me most places I've landed,"" she says.

""Kichwa ngumu is that you can't tell me, I can't do this. Kimbelembele is kwani? (Why not?). What is this thing? How hard can this thing be?""

Wanjiru recognises that her kichwa ngumu and kimbelembele mind-set stem from a gender perspective.

""There is a way we tend to raise girls; we tell them to be demure, sit quietly, and wait to be invited. I'm grateful to my parents, especially my dad; he never did that to me. My dad never looked at me and said that you can't do that, that's for boys. So, fathers play a massive role in the lives of their daughters,"" she reckons.

“Now I have two sons, and I convince them that they can do it. Whatever it is, just go try. Others have done it, and if they haven’t, then you will be the first one to do it.”

One thing that deeply bothers Wanjiru is wasted talent.

""We waste humans in the stupidest of ways, and I really hate it. So, everything I've done is 'how can we stop wasting humans?'"" she says.

""We waste humans because they are poor, because of racism, patriarchy, class. Every job I find myself doing is around that.""

This sentiment is at the core of Akili Dada, a leadership incubator for young women and girls that Wanjiru founded 20 years ago.

""I started Akili Dada when I was only 26 years old. It was very much based on my own experiences. At that age, I was finishing up my PhD, which I obtained at 30 – a crucial milestone for me before having my child. All my education was based on scholarships. People were investing in me; I also wanted to invest in young people, and that was a big motivator for starting Akili Dada,"" she explains.

""Let them call you outspoken - then level up"": Dr Wanjiru's daring advice to women.

Wanjiru's degrees in political science, with a focus on Kenya's transition to democracy, fuelled her interest in nurturing the next generation of women leaders.

Inspired by trailblazers like Martha Karua and Linah Kilimo, she questioned, ""What are we doing with the next generation of leaders? Are we preparing them? We have to be intentional in preparing them. You get better quality leaders if you're intentional in preparing them.

So, Akili Dada was 'how do we, as a country, not lose talent in terms of really bright girls from poor families?'""

Starting with a scholarship program, Akili Dada expanded into a comprehensive initiative working with girls and young women aged 13-35. ""

""The key pillars of the program were access to education, support in the form of mentoring and building intergenerational relationships, as well as experiential learning and leadership,"" Wanjiru says.

During the December holidays, the girls would receive grants of Ksh 3,000 ($22.59) to Ksh5,000 ($37.65) to start community projects in their home areas.

""The project was the beginning of getting them to practice being responsible over communal resources. If you don't start with small responsibilities, then one day when you're in charge of the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), my friend, you'll see smoke. So, can we start training leaders at the high school level and give them responsibilities over their community resources and see how they grow in that responsibility over time?"" she explains.

Although Wanjiru exited Akili Dada just one month shy of its 10-year anniversary, she remains proud of the organisation's continued success.

""When I left, I left. I've never sat on the board. They call me if they have questions, and if I have potential funders, I connect them. I'm really proud of how they have continued to run the organisation,"" she says.

Nineteen years after founding Akili Dada, Dr Wanjiru is on a new mission: to elevate and empower Black women across the world who have reached senior levels of management.

In September 2022, she launched Black Women in Executive Leadership (B-Wel).

""B-Wel's ambition and mission are bigger. The scope is global, and we are doing three things; connecting Black senior female leaders around the world into a community of mutual support. Because racism and patriarchy combined is another, like a tough combination, we are connecting them to share strategies, tools, and tactics that are proving successful as you navigate that intersection of patriarchy and anti-Black racism,"" she explains.

""We are also collecting and curating Black women's wisdom on how to navigate that intersection. We are curating not just for Black women but for others to learn how to navigate global oppressive systems.""

""The third thing we are doing is catalysing collaboration for change. For instance, we have a partnership with the New York Stock Exchange, where we are working to increase the number of Black women serving on the boards of listed companies. We are also partnering with some of the leading executive search firms in the world, the ones that hire CEOs, and we can help them identify a diverse group of candidates and help the Black women position themselves for executive careers.

They are, however, working in a challenging environment when the anti-black movement is threatening any developments aimed at emancipating the black population.

""It's challenging to discuss Black issues, especially in the US where our donors Her strength comes from inner power and daily talks with God, asking the Creator to make her useful. Failure to her is ""not fulfilling my purpose on this planet"" - something she deeply cares about.

During her ""numerous internships"" in good and bad organisations, she found purpose.

Well, in her “tonne of internships,” she did find some purpose.  The purpose to be useful and make a difference in the lives of others.

African scientists

“I’d say, if I ever do this, I do it differently. You see things done badly and you see things done well and if you tell yourself, if I ever get a chance, I’ll do this differently. If a chance finds you, you’ve already decided how you will do it,” she says.

At Award, she transformed it into a pan-African organisation recognised across the continent.

“I took an organisation that didn’t have the deepest connection with partners of the continent and turned it into a pan-African organisation where we walked into the room, and people would recognise us. We raised nearly $40 million for African scientists. I also designed gender and climate change fellowship programs,"" she says proudly.

Joining the Ford Foundation as a senior fellow is a ""tremendous honour as the first Kenyan in this very senior role."" She says she'll use it to advance B-Well's work and contribute to the foundation's mission.

As she empowers women, she warns against suppression.

""Don't let anyone call you too kimbelembele (outspoken); that's their problem. Let them level up.""

She sees Kenya's failure to pass the two-thirds gender law after 14 years as ""political cowardice.""

""It will eventually pass. With balanced perspectives, we could've solved some national issues sooner.""

Those who know her describe her as self-driven and resolute once she sets her mind.

“She is self-driven and believes in justice and equity,” says Peter Irungu, says Peter Irungu, her B-Well co-conceptualiser.

“She’ll say ‘Let’s not just accept the way things are. Let’s disrupt and let’s think a little harder of what’s possible outside of what we’ve been told is possible.”

He reaffirms that B-Well was born to address the barriers Black women have to manoeuvre to reach the executive level and remain there.

“""We thought, 'How can we address that? A fellowship with mentorship, coaching, and a transnational experience?'"" Irungu says.

Joy Zawadi of Akili Dada is inspired by Dr Wanjiru's ""confidence and vision to change communities"" and recognition that ""this continent won't change unless you challenge the status quo.""

She notes that Dr Wanjiru’s exit left a legacy: “leadership isn’t sitting somewhere for 50 to 60 years holding onto power.”

Olunga: Cote d’Ivoire not in our minds for now,"Harambee Stars captain Michael Olunga has warned his teammates against complacency when they face Burundi’s Swallows in a Group 'F' 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi on Friday.

The match will kick off at 4pm Kenyan time and will be broadcast live on national station KBC.

“We respect Cote d'Ivoire as they are African champions but Burundi is also a tough opponent which we must deal with first,"" said Olunga on phone from Lilongwe on Thursday.

""Everybody is talking about Cote d'Ivoire and underrating Burundi which has the same style of play like us and is strong opponent. We should tackle them with a lot of respect,” he added.

Kenya will face group favourites Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday at the same venue.

Football Kenya Federation moved Harambee Stars' home fixtures to Lilongwe's Bingu stadium is because the only venues that could these international matches were MISC and Nyayo Stadium which are currently closed for renovations.

Impressive run

Incidentally, Malawi will be hosting Sao Tome at the same venue on Thursday in a Group 'H' match.

Olunga said he Kenya will have to be at their best to prevail.

The Al-Duhail marksman added that the Malawians have been hospitable to them.

“We were received well in Malawi and our training has also been well. The team is adequately prepared to face Burundi, we will also be targeting a positive outcome against Cote d’Ivoire,” added the former Gor Mahia man.

Olunga heads into the two matches on the back of an impressive run of seven goals scored in Stars’ last three matches.

The former Gor Mahia and Tusker man scored a brace in their 5-0 World Cup qualifying rout of Seychelles on November 20 in Abidjan.

Olunga then helped himself to five goals in the Four Nations tournament held in Malawi in March where Kenya hammered Malawi 4-0 before thumping Zimbabwe 3-1 in the final on March 26.

Latest Fifa rankings

Midfielder John Ochieng said they will approach the match cautiously but “with a winning mentality”.

According to the latest Fifa rankings, Kenya are placed 33 places above Burundi at 107th.

In their eight meetings, Kenya have won three, Burundi two with three draws.

Stars have since Monday been training at Silver Stadium, which is a 10-minute drive from Bingu National Stadium.

Burkinabe Jean Quattara is the centre referee assisted by compatriots Seydou Tiama (first assistant referee), Habib Oumar Sanou (second assistant referee), and Benoit Bado (fourth official).

Tanzanian Leslie Liunda is the referee assessor while South African Bennett Kenneth Bailey will be the match commissioner.

Regular and VIP tickets will retail at 5,000 Malawian Kwacha (about Sh376) and 20,000 Malawian Kwacha (Sh1,500) respectively, and will be available on match day.

How Optica has stayed in the eye wear business since 1959,"How far can a founder's vision take a business? For Optica, arguably Kenya's biggest eye wear retailer, it has been 65 years, which makes it one of the oldest businesses in the country.

It all started with the late Bharat Bhardwaj, an optometrist working at the King George VI Hospital (today Kenyatta National Hospital). It troubled him that his patients had very limited options in terms of affordable eye care. They would get prescriptions from him but struggled to buy decent spectacles.

Then he had a vision.

Why not go into business and offer comprehensive optical care service? Instead of seeing him at the hospital and getting a prescription only to go hunt for affordable eye wear, Bharat reasoned his patiens would get more value for their money if he combined the two services.

He opened the first shop in 1959 on Nairobi's Government Road, now Moi Avenue.

“Back then, people had little knowledge about the optical industry and eye care. The knowledge and experience Bharat Bhardwaj brought helped a great deal in shaping the industry into what it is today,” says Wazeem Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of Optica Kenya.

From the Moi Avenue shop, Optica has grown into 78 branches locally, four in Uganda and two in Rwanda.

What is the secret to the family business' longevity while so many others have faltered before handing the reins to the third generation?

Handling transition

Wazeem says for starters Optica got the transitions right. When a corporate structure was required to get to the next growth level, the family was quick to hire professionals from outside to play key management roles.

In his case, Optica tapped him from the London School of Economics to join the firm in 2013. He reports to the company board chaired by Bharat Bhardwaj's son, Kush.

This transition, according to Wazeem, was a pivotal moment because professional outsiders bring objectivity and add value.

Secondly, Wazeem says Optica has stayed true to the founder's vision, with a strong focus on the customer which has helped it build its brand as a reliable retailer for quality affordable eye wear.

“It did not suddenly emerge. It is an accumulated experience over the years but that doesn’t mean we have been complacent,” he says.

Optica, he notes, works hard to give a specific customer experience which is replicated across all their shops.

“Growth and scaling up bring advantages, and we pass those advantages on to our customers, hence the reason we can offer frames for as low as Sh890, and with that, customer appreciation grows instead of diminishing.”

Cost points and risks

Thirdly, Wazeem points out that in retail businesses like Optica’s, rent is a significant overhead cost alongside human capital expenditure.

By keeping a close eye on the expenditures, the company, he says, ensures a smooth operation.

“The current hard economic time is a risk element we cannot control. We are always looking at policies on the regulatory aspect; taxes changing interests rates, among others,” says Wazeem.

Young workforce

Wazeem says that reliance on a young workforce for businesses today is crucial and that the more a business is geared towards utilising the young workforce, the better it can respond to market requirements.

“Business needs that because naturally, everything at any given time will revolve around people of a certain demography. Ours is mixed though younger segment forms our largest segment,” he says.

Choosing location

At 78 branches locally and still growing, Wazeem says that Optica’s growth and branch locations and selection revolve around areas where the firm’s presence and services are required.

“We look at locations with the absence of credible opticians, and it is more than a business decision. We choose locations where customers will appreciate them, and naturally, that, brings business traction,” says the CEO.

He adds that Optica also picks areas with new property development that allows for customer accessibility and, at the same time, the presence of other retailers.

Funding expansion

The former banker says that to fund its growth and branch expansion, Optica solely relies on its internally generated revenue at its current strength.

“The revenue generated is heavily re-invested in network expansion,” he emphasises, adding that this step doesn’t happen overnight but rather is well planned because items like training of operational staff before deployment, shop remodelling, and equipment sourcing can affect cash flow if not well managed.

Lessons along the way

To have maintained a strong brand for six decades, Wazeem says that their secret lies in their core values of remaining consistent on their objective.

“When businesses grow and start seeing returns, they sometimes tend to lose focus, but businesses need a strong focus, and that’s what we have to do,” he advises.

He further adds that in retail, one key element you have to rely on is the workforce and that if they are motivated, they, in turn, pass that motivation on to customers, resulting in better output and consistency.

“Understanding the needs of your shopper is equally important. One of the reasons family businesses may be limited in growth beyond a certain level is that they may have ambition but achieving those ambitions and aspirations requires vision and a plan,” says Wazeem.

He advises that to achieve sustained growth, businesses should embrace change, and for them, the way Optica operates today is totally different from how it operated 65 years ago.

“The scale has changed and change is inevitable. Response and how you do it are crucial,” he says,

Land investment: How to avoid the dead capital trap,"Branice Wanjiru had gone to her Sacco offices to check how much money she had in savings when she stumbled on quarter-acre parcels of land being sold in Kitengela, Kajiado County.

“The sacco officials told me that there was land they were selling cheaply. They marketed it with the impression of an excellent investment in a developed area closer to the road and not far from Kitengela town,” she says.

She envisioned building her retirement home on this land.

“I decided to hold on to it because the value would go up. I didn’t second-guess myself or do due diligence of visiting the land before I committed my Sh700,000. It was also at a time when I had some loose money and I was on the lookout for somewhere to invest it. I thought that it would be of no use if I just put the money in the bank,” she tells the BDLife.

True to her trust, Ms Wanjiru kept postponing her visit to the land. The sacco had issued her with a title deed, so she knew her investment was solid. A year and a half later, she decided to tour the place.

“I was on leave and I needed money so I went there to weigh options of selling it. I didn’t even know where the land was located, I had to ask the Sacco for directions,” she recalls.

Land speculation has been preferred by many as the route to wealth. Many older Kenyans store their wealth in land, hoping to sell them in hard times. Some strike gold as the land appreciates especially if they bought in an underdeveloped area that then grows fast, roads come up and shopping centres.

Others are not so lucky, as they have to sell at a loss especially when they need the money urgently and if the location takes long to urbanise.

“When I reached there, I found my land was in the middle of nowhere. It took me three hours to locate it. I had to park my car very far before proceeding to the slopes on a motorcycle. Luckily it wasn’t raining as much, but I wondered how my sloppy land located at the bottom would look,” Ms Wanjiru exhales as she narrates her disappointment.

The land that she had been sold for was in a riparian (adjacent to rivers and streams).

“I was so disappointed. It’s difficult to even put a structure there. I knew it would be a difficult task to convince anyone to buy that land so I asked the seller whether they were willing to take it back and just refund my money but they were reluctant since they did not have buyers,” she says.

Land is not a bad investment, financial experts say. But when it is dead capital then it is a bad investment. A majority of Kenyans buy land but find it hard to turn them into money-generating ventures because they are either too small, too far or the owners lack capital.

Joyce Gituro, who also bought a 50 X 100 parcel of land, saw it as a speculative investment. She was told about the land by a friend. It is in Mastoo in Juja, Kiambu County, close to the then-proposed bypass road. She was convinced that it was a good idea.

“I went for that particular parcel of land because of the proposed bypass road that was to be built connecting Kangundo Road and Thika Road. I knew the value would double with time,” she says.

Thinking of how much the land would fetch in a few years she paid Sh800,000. The long wait that started in 2016 finally came to an end. She is lucky though. The land has doubled in price but searching for a buyer has not been an easy ride.

“I want to sell the piece of land because I have an ongoing project that requires more money and the returns are good, also given that the land value has appreciated twice its price,” she says.

Ms Gituro says finding a buyer was hard because development in the area has been slow. The proposed bypass was also never built.

“The challenge of selling this piece is due to accessibility, the roads are very bad. There are no schools, the nearest one is quite a distance away. There is also an issue of title deeds, though I have the share certificate in my name,” she says, “the proposed bypass would have changed everything about that area. It wasn’t a bad investment if everything had fallen in place.”

For Ms Wanjiru, she says hers was a bad investment decision.

“That land could have cost no more than Sh250,000. To be honest, if I can get someone to just refund my money because with land you cannot rush you will either get a buyer or not,” she says.

Read: What to consider before you put money in real estate

What should someone consider before investing in land?

Land investment is like a commodity, whether you choose to invest in it or not. The higher the population growth, the more valuable it becomes.

Johnson Nderi, an independent consultant and corporate finance expert, says if you can manage the risk of acquisition, land is generally a good investment in terms of its store of value.

“One of the problems with holding cash is that it can be eroded by things like inflation. As inflation diminishes, land appreciates on the other side. It is a good hedge against inflation because it tends to acquire higher than inflation rate valuation,” he says.

When it comes to credibility, Mr Nderi insists on working with a good conveyancing lawyer. A lawyer who understands the risks you may face and has a way of eliminating them. The process protects you from being scammed.

“The main risk would be buying a bad asset and they can help you with the due diligence. Factors like the location of the land, make it prone to land invasion. For the transaction process, does the property belong to the seller, Are there multiple legal frameworks for the property?”

In addition, as an investor, you should understand the basics, which include a survey. Take time to research the property you want to buy and don't be in a hurry as it can turn into an investment nightmare.

Do not follow the crowd, John Monyoncho, a financial adviser said at an investor education conference held in Nairobi recently.

“Everything we invest in is risky, but be aware of risks before paying. Understand what you are investing in and where you are investing. Applied knowledge is power,” he says.

'Let's disrupt!' How Dr Wanjiru Rutenberg shattered global glass ceilings,"At the tender age of 14, Wanjiru Kamau embarked on a life-changing journey. Her parents, with grand aspirations for their eldest child, made a pivotal decision – to send her to the foreign land of Denver, Colorado, in the United States.

It was a time when winter's chill had enveloped the city, but Wanjiru had no choice but to adapt to her new surroundings.

Her host, an uncle who was a surgeon, promptly enrolled her in a public school, where she experienced a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities.

This exposure and interaction with multiracial student body opened Wanjiru's eyes to the lost opportunities for her people in Africa, particularly in her home country, Kenya. It instilled in her a burning desire to pay it forward.

True to her parents' dreams, Wanjiru did not disappoint. At the age of 30, she returned home as Dr Wanjiru Kamau – and married, taking on the name Dr Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg.

Her accomplishments brought immense joy to her father, a retired electrical engineer from Kenya Airways, and her mother, a former employee of the Teachers Service Commission.

Throughout her higher education journey, Wanjiru was fortunate to receive a scholarship that covered her undergraduate and postgraduate studies. She earned a degree in politics from Whitman College and seamlessly transitioned to the University of Minnesota, where she completed her master's and doctoral degrees in political science.

“I wanted to be a lawyer like Martha Karua.  I also admired James Orengo (Siaya Governor), and (Prof) Anyang’ Nyong’o (Kisumu Governor) who is also a political scientist,” she shares.

However, financial constraints as a foreign student in the US led her to pursue political science, as it offered funding for her doctoral studies.

“Then I wanted to do public policy, and I ran into the same problem.  Then I discovered if I did political science, they would actually pay so long as I told them I was going to get a PhD. If I told them I only needed a Master’s, they would make me pay but if I told them I was signing up for the PhD, they would pay my fees and a monthly stipend to be a teaching assistant.”

But this daughter of Kamau, the man who raised her to know she can do anything in this world, has indeed held high-flying global positions so parallel to her training.

Global initiative

From her role as director at the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (Award), where she expanded its range and diversity of partners, to her position as an executive in-residence at Schmidt Futures, where she designed and built a global initiative for Black women senior leaders, her impact has been far-reaching.

Her work has also extended to several boards and advisory councils of organisations investing in agriculture, climate change, environment, philanthropic work, human development, and social ventures, including the African Climate Foundation, Centre for Development Research, Wangari Maathai Foundation, Bridge Collaborative, and New Economy Venture Accelerator, among others.

In the past four months alone, she has been appointed to significant positions, including a senior fellowship at the Ford Foundation and a seat on the executive board of the global Crop Trust, which implements the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.

I ask her how she cracked it.

Wanjiru attributes it to her curiosity and unwavering determination. ""Political science just gave me a degree. But kuwa kimbelembele na kichwa ngumu (being curious and firm-minded) has landed me most places I've landed,"" she says.

""Kichwa ngumu is that you can't tell me, I can't do this. Kimbelembele is kwani? (Why not?). What is this thing? How hard can this thing be?""

Wanjiru recognises that her kichwa ngumu and kimbelembele mind-set stem from a gender perspective.

""There is a way we tend to raise girls; we tell them to be demure, sit quietly, and wait to be invited. I'm grateful to my parents, especially my dad; he never did that to me. My dad never looked at me and said that you can't do that, that's for boys. So, fathers play a massive role in the lives of their daughters,"" she reckons.

“Now I have two sons, and I convince them that they can do it. Whatever it is, just go try. Others have done it, and if they haven’t, then you will be the first one to do it.”

One thing that deeply bothers Wanjiru is wasted talent.

""We waste humans in the stupidest of ways, and I really hate it. So, everything I've done is 'how can we stop wasting humans?'"" she says.

""We waste humans because they are poor, because of racism, patriarchy, class. Every job I find myself doing is around that.""

This sentiment is at the core of Akili Dada, a leadership incubator for young women and girls that Wanjiru founded 20 years ago.

""I started Akili Dada when I was only 26 years old. It was very much based on my own experiences. At that age, I was finishing up my PhD, which I obtained at 30 – a crucial milestone for me before having my child. All my education was based on scholarships. People were investing in me; I also wanted to invest in young people, and that was a big motivator for starting Akili Dada,"" she explains.

""Let them call you outspoken - then level up"": Dr Wanjiru's daring advice to women.

Wanjiru's degrees in political science, with a focus on Kenya's transition to democracy, fuelled her interest in nurturing the next generation of women leaders.

Inspired by trailblazers like Martha Karua and Linah Kilimo, she questioned, ""What are we doing with the next generation of leaders? Are we preparing them? We have to be intentional in preparing them. You get better quality leaders if you're intentional in preparing them.

So, Akili Dada was 'how do we, as a country, not lose talent in terms of really bright girls from poor families?'""

Starting with a scholarship program, Akili Dada expanded into a comprehensive initiative working with girls and young women aged 13-35. ""

""The key pillars of the program were access to education, support in the form of mentoring and building intergenerational relationships, as well as experiential learning and leadership,"" Wanjiru says.

During the December holidays, the girls would receive grants of Ksh 3,000 ($22.59) to Ksh5,000 ($37.65) to start community projects in their home areas.

""The project was the beginning of getting them to practice being responsible over communal resources. If you don't start with small responsibilities, then one day when you're in charge of the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), my friend, you'll see smoke. So, can we start training leaders at the high school level and give them responsibilities over their community resources and see how they grow in that responsibility over time?"" she explains.

Although Wanjiru exited Akili Dada just one month shy of its 10-year anniversary, she remains proud of the organisation's continued success.

""When I left, I left. I've never sat on the board. They call me if they have questions, and if I have potential funders, I connect them. I'm really proud of how they have continued to run the organisation,"" she says.

Nineteen years after founding Akili Dada, Dr Wanjiru is on a new mission: to elevate and empower Black women across the world who have reached senior levels of management.

In September 2022, she launched Black Women in Executive Leadership (B-Wel).

""B-Wel's ambition and mission are bigger. The scope is global, and we are doing three things; connecting Black senior female leaders around the world into a community of mutual support. Because racism and patriarchy combined is another, like a tough combination, we are connecting them to share strategies, tools, and tactics that are proving successful as you navigate that intersection of patriarchy and anti-Black racism,"" she explains.

""We are also collecting and curating Black women's wisdom on how to navigate that intersection. We are curating not just for Black women but for others to learn how to navigate global oppressive systems.""

""The third thing we are doing is catalysing collaboration for change. For instance, we have a partnership with the New York Stock Exchange, where we are working to increase the number of Black women serving on the boards of listed companies. We are also partnering with some of the leading executive search firms in the world, the ones that hire CEOs, and we can help them identify a diverse group of candidates and help the Black women position themselves for executive careers.

They are, however, working in a challenging environment when the anti-black movement is threatening any developments aimed at emancipating the black population.

""It's challenging to discuss Black issues, especially in the US where our donors Her strength comes from inner power and daily talks with God, asking the Creator to make her useful. Failure to her is ""not fulfilling my purpose on this planet"" - something she deeply cares about.

During her ""numerous internships"" in good and bad organisations, she found purpose.

Well, in her “tonne of internships,” she did find some purpose.  The purpose to be useful and make a difference in the lives of others.

African scientists

“I’d say, if I ever do this, I do it differently. You see things done badly and you see things done well and if you tell yourself, if I ever get a chance, I’ll do this differently. If a chance finds you, you’ve already decided how you will do it,” she says.

At Award, she transformed it into a pan-African organisation recognised across the continent.

“I took an organisation that didn’t have the deepest connection with partners of the continent and turned it into a pan-African organisation where we walked into the room, and people would recognise us. We raised nearly $40 million for African scientists. I also designed gender and climate change fellowship programs,"" she says proudly.

Joining the Ford Foundation as a senior fellow is a ""tremendous honour as the first Kenyan in this very senior role."" She says she'll use it to advance B-Well's work and contribute to the foundation's mission.

As she empowers women, she warns against suppression.

""Don't let anyone call you too kimbelembele (outspoken); that's their problem. Let them level up.""

She sees Kenya's failure to pass the two-thirds gender law after 14 years as ""political cowardice.""

""It will eventually pass. With balanced perspectives, we could've solved some national issues sooner.""

Those who know her describe her as self-driven and resolute once she sets her mind.

“She’ll say ‘Let’s not just accept the way things are. Let’s disrupt and let’s think a little harder of what’s possible outside of what we’ve been told is possible.”

He reaffirms that B-Well was born to address the barriers Black women have to manoeuvre to reach the executive level and remain there.

“""We thought, 'How can we address that? A fellowship with mentorship, coaching, and a transnational experience?'"" Irungu says.

Joy Zawadi of Akili Dada is inspired by Dr Wanjiru's ""confidence and vision to change communities"" and recognition that ""this continent won't change unless you challenge the status quo.""

She notes that Dr Wanjiru’s exit left a legacy: “leadership isn’t sitting somewhere for 50 to 60 years holding onto power.”

Moses Wetang’ula’s push to unite Western rattles ODM chiefs,"National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula appears to have renewed his bid to consolidate Western region by reaching out to opposition politicians in a series of meetings.

Mr Wetang’ula hosted a section of ODM Members of County Assembly (MCAs) from the region at his Bungoma home on Monday.

The meeting, which was also attended by some of the opposition MPs from the region, has rattled ODM leader Raila Odinga, who has since threatened disciplinary action against the members who attended the meeting.

Nation has established that at least 10 ODM MCAs were in attendance after Mr Wetang’ula invited all MCAs from Busia, Kakamega, Bungoma and Vihiga County Assemblies.

ODM, through its Executive Director Oduor Ong’wen, had in a letter dated May 29 warned the MCAs against attending the meeting.

Informal invitation

“The ODM party has been informed of an informal invitation to some or all of you by the Leader of Ford Kenya Party, Moses Wetang’ula, to a meeting on or around June 3, 2024 at his home in Kabuchai, and whose agenda is unknown to us,” said Mr Ong’wen.

“I am instructed by the party leadership to inform you that attendance of such a meeting shall be subject to the ODM constitution Article 12 (1) (c) and lead to being deemed to have resigned from party membership,” the party warned.

Lugari MP Nabii Nabwera (ODM), who serves as Western Parliamentary Caucus’ chairman, and has been crucial in organising some of the recent meetings graced by Mr Wetang’ula, denied knowledge of the Monday engagement with the MCAs.

“I am not aware of the meeting between the Speaker and ODM MCAs,” said the MP.

But credible sources within ODM and Mr Wetang’ula’s office confirmed that the meeting took place with about three ODM MPs in attendance.

Mr Wetang’ula appears to be exploiting the resignation of Prime Cabinet Secretary (PCS) Musalia Mudavadi as Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader, which has made him less active in local and party politics.

On January 29, Mr Wetang’ula held a meeting with Western Kenya MPs drawn from across the political divide at Keekorok Lodge Masai Mara, lifting the lid on his behind-the-scenes manoeuvres to rally the leaders around him.

Political undertones

Although described as a ‘routine’ caucus of Western Kenya MPs, the meeting had political undertones after some politicians perceived to be close to Mr Mudavadi and Mr Odinga skipped it.

Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba, who doubles up as ANC Secretary General, did not attend the meeting. Vihiga Senator Godfrey Osotsi, a close ally of Mr Odinga, also gave the meeting a wide berth.

The meeting was attended by MPs Oscar Nabulindo (Matungu), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero), Ferdinand Wanyonyi (Kwanza), Martin Pepela (Webuye), Patrick Simiyu (Cherangany), Elsie Mahanda (Kakamega), Geoffrey Mulanya (Nambale), John Walukhe (Sirisia) and Fred Ikana (Shinyalu).

Others who were in the meeting were Joshua Oyula (Butula), Dick Oyugi (Luanda), Johnson Naika (Mumias West), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Immanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), John Chikati (Tongaren), John Makali (Kanduyi), Innocent Mugabe (Likuyani), Benard Shinali (Ikolomani), Clement Sloya (Sabatia), Titus Khamala (Lurambi), Oku Kaunya (Teso North), Nabii Nabwera (Lugari), Majimbo Kalasinga (Kabuchai), Didmus Barasa (Kimilili) and Bungoma Senator Wafula Wakoli.

During President William Ruto’s visit in the region in February, Mr Wetang’ula disclosed how he has been rallying leaders from the region to unite and work as a team.

AI X-ray machines to boost TB diagnosis at Nakuru referral hospital,"The fight against tuberculosis (TB) at Nakuru Level Five Hospital, the largest hospital in South Rift region, has received a significant boost with the acquisition of a digital AI-enabled X-ray machine.

This advanced technology, the first of its kind in Nakuru, aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of TB diagnosis at the hospital, facilitating appropriate treatment.

The machine was acquired through support from the National TB Programme, the African Medical Research Foundation and Qure.ai, an AI solutions provider.

It is expected to revolutionise TB diagnosis by enhancing imaging accuracy through AI-supported tools and reducing turnaround time for patients.

The AI tools can read chest X-rays, assisting healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses. Radiologists, radiographers and clinical officers from the chest clinic and the hospital’s outpatient department have already been trained on the use of this technology.

Chest X-rays are a common method for screening and triaging people for TB and assessing lung damage. With AI, results are more precise and available within minutes, allowing health workers to quickly determine the next steps for TB care for patients.

""The technology will be a game changer at the facility that serves about six counties. Artificial Intelligence screens for TB more accurately, leading to improved treatment for patients. The AI-enabled X-ray machine will make things easier for doctors and patients and play an important role in TB treatment,"" Nakuru County Health Executive Roselyn Mungai said.

Eradication of TB in Africa has been challenging due to various social, economic, healthcare, and biological factors.

The co-infection of HIV/Aids and TB is a major challenge as it weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to TB and complicating the management of both diseases.

Limited access to healthcare due to poverty, the high cost of treatment, and the inability to maintain proper nutrition, which is crucial for TB recovery, have exacerbated the situation.

""Nakuru is now a step forward in the fight against TB, having tapped into the technology to provide automated interpretation of radiology exams like X-rays, CTs and ultrasound scans, enabling faster diagnosis and speedier treatment of the disease,"" said Ms Mungai.

Nakuru Level Five Hospital is now among eight facilities nationwide that have initiated the programme of Digital Chest X-ray (DCXR) with AI, introducing the new diagnostic tools in accordance with World Health Organization recommendations under the TB Programme supported by USAID through the STOP TB Partnership.

Tuberculosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Kenya. It affects all age groups, but has its greatest toll in the most productive age group of 15 to 44 years.

The major factor responsible for the large TB disease burden in Kenya is the concurrent HIV epidemic.



New tech to improve access to cardiac care in remote areas

Meanwhile, patients with heart disease in remote and outreach areas will have access to improved care through the use of a new technology that enables cardiologists to review patients' electrocardiogram (ECG) data even when they are far from the examining physician.

This follows a partnership between GE HealthCare, a global leader in healthcare technology, and Daktari Africa, a pioneering telemedicine platform, to support Kenya's National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases by helping clinicians better diagnose and treat cardiovascular disease.

The MUSE™ NX software, developed by GE HealthCare, allows for easy integration, enhanced security protection and rapid deployment of updates, ultimately supporting fast and accurate diagnoses.

With GE HealthCare's support, Daktari Africa will work with the Kiambu County government to implement the MUSE™ NX system in health centres across the county.

Following the installation of the MUSE™ NX system, the GE HealthCare team will provide training to Daktari Africa and its partners to ensure that healthcare professionals are equipped with the necessary skills to maximise the impact of the platform.

“This collaboration seeks to revolutionise cardiac care in Kenya by bringing advanced diagnostic capabilities to remote areas. Through tele-ECG screenings, we can facilitate early detection of critical conditions, reduce hospitalisations and improve patient outcomes. We are pleased to be working with GE HealthCare to make a positive impact on healthcare delivery in our country,"" said Dr Charles Kamotho, founder and CEO of Daktari Africa.

“By providing physicians with access to patient ECG information, the MUSE™ NX solution will support informed decision-making and high-quality care for a disease that is placing an increasing burden on the nation’s health system. By combining clinical expertise, telemedicine specialisation and advanced healthcare technologies, we can help save time in the diagnosis and treatment process, increase staff productivity and enhance patient care quality,"" said Moussa Gholmieh, general manager for Patient Care Solutions, Emerging Markets, GE HealthCare

According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of non-communicable disease mortality in the country.

Alternative justice system will end backlog of cases,"Kenya’s culturally rich communities proudly champion and practise their own forms of justice that are tethered to basic mechanisms and principles of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence.

This inherent system, customary or informal justice mechanisms, was the core of dispute resolutions as communities thrived with the constituents satisfied with how justice was dispensed.

At the onset of colonisation, most of these laws were considered retrogressive, archaic and outdated as the colonial master introduced those that he considered supreme but, in reality, were favourable to white settlers and punitive to indigenous peoples.

Pre-independence, vestiges of the colonial constitution formed part of independent Kenya’s laws, which also did not formally recognise informal justice systems. Following the 2010 Constitution, however, the country has strived to recognise some of these alternative justice systems (AJS) in line with the directive in Article 159(2)(c) of the Constitution, thus the development of the relevant policy.

Cultural issues

The Judiciary says 78 per cent of justice seekers in Kenya use mechanisms for justice that are outside the formal courts, proving that the mechanism are no longer regarded as ‘others’ or subordinate alternatives. The success of AJS is pegged on its people-centred approach to justice and also familiarity to addressing cultural issues with lasting solutions.

That AJS is considered a faster route to justice while also providing durable resolutions to disputes is among the reasons it continues to thrive.

The AJS policy strives to ensure that, to properly recognise, regulate and enhance its use, it must align its operation with the principles and values of the Constitution and international human rights standards. All this while underscoring the need for a pluralistic approach to justice that is sensitive to cultural, socioeconomic and geographical diversity of the nation.

Take, for instance, the Borana community, which is also spread in parts of southern Ethiopia. For centuries, it has relied on the Gada system to resolve major social, political and economic conflicts. The Adulaa Council is entrusted with upholding peace and harmony within the community.

Among the Somali, the Maslaha system has been used to resolve conflicts, hugely assisting in enhancing reconciliation and cohesion within the community. In recent years, however, it has been abused by some individuals in cases involving criminal matters such as murder and even rape or defilement.

Alternative dispute resolution

On this, there is a need to ensure alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms do not contravene available legal instruments that prescribe penalties for such offences. Also, it is important that victims are not denied their deserved justice.

Elders, the ultimate custodians of law within their communities, must be properly sensitised on the principles and values of the constitution and international human rights standards to fairly dispense justice when hearing and resolving cases. The same case with members of the community.

AJS has facilitated the resolution of disputes that would otherwise have burdened the formal courts, reducing the endemic backlog of cases. Concerted efforts should, however, also be put in sufficiently documenting the impact of AJS on justice outcomes and the administration of justice as the Judiciary continues to set up specialised centres countrywide.

 ,"In recent months, there has been a lot of buzz about President William Ruto being America’s new blue-eyed boy in East Africa (even Africa).

As he visits the West and is feted, and on the back of his recent state visit to the US, the first for an African leader in 16 years, there has been a lot of writing, a lot of it draped in national colours, declaring that Kenya is the undisputed “anchor state” in the region and a principal ally of the West. Dr Ruto’s fan club has called him a “voice for Africa”. He seems to be warming up to the accolades and has permitted himself to talk of his vision for the African Union and the continent.

Previous figures that played that role in the region are being written off as expired and damaged goods. On the left of the African political spectrum, there are warnings. “America will use and then spit you like stale meat”, radical pan-Africans have advised President Ruto free of charge. Literary giant Ngugi wa Thiong’o, in a heartbroken message, has suggested that the President is an imperialist agent and nothing has hurt him like his country’s decision to send its police to intervene in lawless Haiti. President Ruto, the radicals say, will be thrown under the bus and end up like former US anti-communist ally of the US and president of the then-Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo), Mobutu Sese Seko.

Superpowers

How might one explain all this to a curious grandmother? Global power politics is driven by superpowers. But superpowers like the USA don’t have boots on the ground worldwide. They need friends, and allies, to work with in other regions to pursue their interests; for example, keeping shipping passages safe for their corporations to trade around the world. Keeping the Indian Ocean region along the East African coast secure is important, so it will strike a deal with a country with the ability to chase Somalia-based pirates away or has facilities from which they can launch operations against the criminals themselves. Those pirates are believed to share their loot with Somali-based Al-Shabaab militants.

Kenya has a naval base in Manda Bay, Lamu, which the Americans can use. During President Ruto’s trip, Washington announced that it would pay for constructing a 10,000-foot runway at Manda Bay Airstrip to enhance Kenya’s efforts against Al-Shabaab. And, needless to say, the US would likely use it more than Kenya.

Money in the bank

But a runway is not enough; in exchange, Kenya needs more. So the US threw in fighter helicopters and amphibian materiel. In the end, all these things are about money in the bank—and global capital needs regional hubs to collect their money and then send it to their home banks, or to bring their money and have platforms and institutions from which to distribute it for investment.



Kenya is that hub in the region, and many financial institutions, banks that are growing very fat on big profits, and money managers are based in Nairobi. And, as a hub, it gets a nice little cut of the money that is sloshing around.

Besides, this doesn’t fall from heaven like manna. Being a regional geopolitical player requires your government and people to invest their money, labour and intellect. The only advantage you enjoy for free is geographic location. To be a financial hub, you have to build financial institutions of near-world standards.

Peace enforcer

For your military to go and be a peace enforcer, it must be worth it. You cannot send a clan militia in monkey skin, that can’t shoot straight or read a map, to face the fierce gangs in Haiti or confront Al-Shabaab. The money from the geopolitical games, then, could be seen as a return on your investment.

And there is more. If you muscle your way to being a regional geopolitical power, your president will sit either at the table or the next row at international meetings. The president of the World Bank will pick up his call if he rings. But when a befuddled prime minister of a restless nation in the Sahel calls, it will be put through to his deputy.

If there is a big international conference on refugees, peace and security or climate change, attended by 2,000 delegates, it is likely to come to your capital—not to the country further inland, where it would have to be held in a makeshift stadium, has only 100 hotel rooms and doesn’t completely nothing for the region or the world. If each of those delegates spends $1,000 on accommodation, taxis, beer, nyama choma and paying for the company of your finest young men and women, that is $2 million in the economy. Not too bad for two days’ work.

Anti-imperialists and patriots despise this picture. It is exploitative, they say. And they are not wrong. But the reality is that if country A doesn’t seize this sub-contractor and conduit role, there is always country B that will do so. In realpolitik, you might as well be the one that sits on the hill.

Fix ailing health sector to ease Kenyans’ agony,"

Access to affordable quality healthcare is a right that every Kenyan is entitled to but which remains elusive due to lack of funds. The universal health coverage (UHC) is an idea the authorities have just been toying around with.

Since he took office well over a year ago, President William Ruto has given assurances on healthcare. His footprint is evident in the ongoing setting up of the Social Health Insurance Fund (Shif). It is expected to deliver where its predecessor, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which was perennially riddled with mismanagement and corruption issues, failed.

There is an acute shortage of essential medicines and key vaccines in public hospitals and health centres countrywide. It is very depressing that there is no HIV medication for children, as well as painkillers, antidepressants and antibiotics in these facilities on which the majority of Kenyans rely for their medical care. Critically ill patients lack life-saving drugs and treatment.

Ironically, this comes at a time when services are being restored following the end of a doctors’ strike that lasted more than 50 days. The medics may be back but they do not have what they need to save lives. Medicines needed for life-saving surgeries are also missing. While some patients who could have been saved had the doctors been at work ended up dying, the medics are now present but helpless.

All 47 counties ran out of drugs after Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) withheld supplies over a Sh3 billion debt. Also owed huge debts are international health organisations such as Global Alliance for Vaccines and immunisation (Gavi) and Unicef.

The assurance by Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha now says the hitch has been resolved and some drugs been imported while others are expected soon is welcome. However, the ailing health sector is a mockery of a nation where leaders routinely blow huge funds on foreign and domestic travel for their own convenience when patients are dying because there are no medicines in the taxpayer-funded public hospitals.

This calls for urgent measures to curb the widespread suffering. The top leaders must urgently reset national priorities

Road to UHC: The elephant in the room when it comes to Social Health Insurance Act in Kenya,"The gazettement of the Social Health Insurance Act regulations signalled that Kenya’s UHC train was on the move. There were some key issues raised during public participation that were incorporated and others were not.

Households with salaried income would contribute monthly contributions of 2.75 percent was not capped at the proposed Sh5,000 as initially expected. The contribution shall not be less than Sh300 with remittance being done by the ninth day of every month including public service and county employees.

Whereas a household whose income is not derived from salaried employment shall contribute to the Social Health Insurance Fund (Shif) annually at a rate of 2.75 percent of the household income as determined by the means testing instrument prescribed in the regulations.

Why Kenyans are worried about the UHC rollout

Why Kenyans are worried about the UHC rollout

The means testing, put simply would be an exercise to determine household composition and socio-economic aspects. One epidemiologist referred to it as “similar to a census only shorter”, focused on the determination and estimation of the household income for the payment of the premiums set out in the regulations.

Some experts have queried funding mechanisms to conduct the means testing exercise and will they leverage existing databases, particularly at the county level?

Nevertheless, the National Assembly would be able to appropriate funds for indigents (those who can’t pay as can’t afford necessities), vulnerable persons and persons under lawful custody.

Biometrics capture

Kenyans would, however, have to register anew including biometrics capture for both contributors and beneficiaries above 7 years old. All those above 18 years old would be expected to register as contributors. Those under 21 years old with no income or under 25 years old but enrolled in an institute of learning could remain as beneficiaries.

Kenyans Want to hear about services under UHC

Kenyans Want to hear about services under UHC

There were set guidelines involving the three funds that make up the Social Health Insurance Act, that is, the Primary Healthcare Fund, Shif and Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund.

The simplest is the government allocation or tax-funded Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund which would include contracted ambulance services. A shortlist of healthcare cases that would be considered emergencies from heart attacks to seizures was provided. Any accredited facility would be required to provide both resuscitation and stabilization services to any Shif member for a maximum of 24 hours. Members with chronic conditions would first utilize the benefits under Shif and once they exhaust their limits, could then access services under the Chronic fund.

The Primary Healthcare fund would cover care in healthcare facilities designated, levels 2 to 4. The essentials of Primary Healthcare Networks come into play as one starts with the lower-level facility and only presents to a higher-level facility upon receiving a referral note, apart from emergency services. How then would members know the facility levels? Previously, NHIF required members to select their nearest facility.

Why rural hospitals in Kenya have stopped accepting NHIF cards

Why rural hospitals in Kenya have stopped accepting NHIF cards

SHIF, being the only contributory fund of the three would cater for services in levels 4 to 6 facilities which included specialized services. An excellent provision here is Mental Health and Palliative Services being covered.

Two crucial questions remain, ‘What would be the benefits?’ Following a member’s contribution what services would be covered and to what extent? The list of interventions to be included in the benefits package is still being discussed, by the Benefits Package and Tariffs Advisory Panel. On the other end of the spectrum, ‘What would healthcare facilities and providers be paid (Tariffs) for rendering these services?’.

The regulations clearly stated that the contributions made to the National Hospital Insurance Fund would be transferred to Shif and all data would be retained till all claims are settled to healthcare providers. In the next column, we discuss concerns facilities and providers have with regard to UHC.

Adopt a bicycle for good health,"June 3 was the World Bicycle Day, which the United Nations General Assembly started celebrating in 2018. Its purpose is to educate the public on the benefits of cycling to health and the environment.

Exercise riding is the bicycle itself. Due to the advent of motorised vehicles, where the pollution has also increased, the physical exercise of man has also ended. Besides being pollution-free, cycling is helpful in obesity reduction and weight control.

In today’s fast-paced life, everybody wants to reach their destination in the blink of an eye. So, we left bicycles and started using motorised vehicles.

In earlier times, most people either walked or used bicycles. Because of that, they were physically active and fit. But as urbanisation increased, cycling also declined significantly. Most people own a car, whose excessive use harms the environment and health.

Bicycle rallies

When we get sick in the cycle of living a busy and ostentatious life, doctors advise us to do bicycle exercises. Then we spend money to ride a gym bike or use the treadmill. Why don’t we ride a bicycle for at least one hour a day, before the doctors tell us to?

Even in the olden times, the bicycle was considered a very important tool, especially because it was the most widely affordable and easiest way of transportation for people and goods. Bicycles were used by almost everyone—from farmers to students. For the poor, it was the main means of commute, by which they could easily go to work and school.

On World Bicycle Day, many local bicycle clubs and groups organise bicycle rallies and trips. Special programmes are organised to educate the youth about the benefits of bicycles. Bicycle races and competitions are held. This is not a one-day event but a long-term effort to promote cycling.

Money in the bank

But a runway is not enough; in exchange, Kenya needs more. So the US threw in fighter helicopters and amphibian materiel. In the end, all these things are about money in the bank—and global capital needs regional hubs to collect their money and then send it to their home banks, or to bring their money and have platforms and institutions from which to distribute it for investment.



Kenya is that hub in the region, and many financial institutions, banks that are growing very fat on big profits, and money managers are based in Nairobi. And, as a hub, it gets a nice little cut of the money that is sloshing around.

Besides, this doesn’t fall from heaven like manna. Being a regional geopolitical player requires your government and people to invest their money, labour and intellect. The only advantage you enjoy for free is geographic location. To be a financial hub, you have to build financial institutions of near-world standards.

Peace enforcer

For your military to go and be a peace enforcer, it must be worth it. You cannot send a clan militia in monkey skin, that can’t shoot straight or read a map, to face the fierce gangs in Haiti or confront Al-Shabaab. The money from the geopolitical games, then, could be seen as a return on your investment.

And there is more. If you muscle your way to being a regional geopolitical power, your president will sit either at the table or the next row at international meetings. The president of the World Bank will pick up his call if he rings. But when a befuddled prime minister of a restless nation in the Sahel calls, it will be put through to his deputy.

If there is a big international conference on refugees, peace and security or climate change, attended by 2,000 delegates, it is likely to come to your capital—not to the country further inland, where it would have to be held in a makeshift stadium, has only 100 hotel rooms and doesn’t completely nothing for the region or the world. If each of those delegates spends $1,000 on accommodation, taxis, beer, nyama choma and paying for the company of your finest young men and women, that is $2 million in the economy. Not too bad for two days’ work.

Anti-imperialists and patriots despise this picture. It is exploitative, they say. And they are not wrong. But the reality is that if country A doesn’t seize this sub-contractor and conduit role, there is always country B that will do so. In realpolitik, you might as well be the one that sits on the hill.

Alternative justice system will end backlog of cases,"Kenya’s culturally rich communities proudly champion and practise their own forms of justice that are tethered to basic mechanisms and principles of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence.

This inherent system, customary or informal justice mechanisms, was the core of dispute resolutions as communities thrived with the constituents satisfied with how justice was dispensed.

At the onset of colonisation, most of these laws were considered retrogressive, archaic and outdated as the colonial master introduced those that he considered supreme but, in reality, were favourable to white settlers and punitive to indigenous peoples.

Pre-independence, vestiges of the colonial constitution formed part of independent Kenya’s laws, which also did not formally recognise informal justice systems. Following the 2010 Constitution, however, the country has strived to recognise some of these alternative justice systems (AJS) in line with the directive in Article 159(2)(c) of the Constitution, thus the development of the relevant policy.

Cultural issues

The Judiciary says 78 per cent of justice seekers in Kenya use mechanisms for justice that are outside the formal courts, proving that the mechanism are no longer regarded as ‘others’ or subordinate alternatives. The success of AJS is pegged on its people-centred approach to justice and also familiarity to addressing cultural issues with lasting solutions.

That AJS is considered a faster route to justice while also providing durable resolutions to disputes is among the reasons it continues to thrive.

The AJS policy strives to ensure that, to properly recognise, regulate and enhance its use, it must align its operation with the principles and values of the Constitution and international human rights standards. All this while underscoring the need for a pluralistic approach to justice that is sensitive to cultural, socioeconomic and geographical diversity of the nation.

Take, for instance, the Borana community, which is also spread in parts of southern Ethiopia. For centuries, it has relied on the Gada system to resolve major social, political and economic conflicts. The Adulaa Council is entrusted with upholding peace and harmony within the community.

Among the Somali, the Maslaha system has been used to resolve conflicts, hugely assisting in enhancing reconciliation and cohesion within the community. In recent years, however, it has been abused by some individuals in cases involving criminal matters such as murder and even rape or defilement.

Alternative dispute resolution

On this, there is a need to ensure alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms do not contravene available legal instruments that prescribe penalties for such offences. Also, it is important that victims are not denied their deserved justice.

Elders, the ultimate custodians of law within their communities, must be properly sensitised on the principles and values of the constitution and international human rights standards to fairly dispense justice when hearing and resolving cases. The same case with members of the community.

AJS has facilitated the resolution of disputes that would otherwise have burdened the formal courts, reducing the endemic backlog of cases. Concerted efforts should, however, also be put in sufficiently documenting the impact of AJS on justice outcomes and the administration of justice as the Judiciary continues to set up specialised centres countrywide.

Fix ailing health sector to ease Kenyans’ agony,"

Access to affordable quality healthcare is a right that every Kenyan is entitled to but which remains elusive due to lack of funds. The universal health coverage (UHC) is an idea the authorities have just been toying around with.

Since he took office well over a year ago, President William Ruto has given assurances on healthcare. His footprint is evident in the ongoing setting up of the Social Health Insurance Fund (Shif). It is expected to deliver where its predecessor, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which was perennially riddled with mismanagement and corruption issues, failed.

There is an acute shortage of essential medicines and key vaccines in public hospitals and health centres countrywide. It is very depressing that there is no HIV medication for children, as well as painkillers, antidepressants and antibiotics in these facilities on which the majority of Kenyans rely for their medical care. Critically ill patients lack life-saving drugs and treatment.

Ironically, this comes at a time when services are being restored following the end of a doctors’ strike that lasted more than 50 days. The medics may be back but they do not have what they need to save lives. Medicines needed for life-saving surgeries are also missing. While some patients who could have been saved had the doctors been at work ended up dying, the medics are now present but helpless.

All 47 counties ran out of drugs after Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) withheld supplies over a Sh3 billion debt. Also owed huge debts are international health organisations such as Global Alliance for Vaccines and immunisation (Gavi) and Unicef.

The assurance by Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha now says the hitch has been resolved and some drugs been imported while others are expected soon is welcome. However, the ailing health sector is a mockery of a nation where leaders routinely blow huge funds on foreign and domestic travel for their own convenience when patients are dying because there are no medicines in the taxpayer-funded public hospitals.

This calls for urgent measures to curb the widespread suffering. The top leaders must urgently reset national priorities

Road to UHC: The elephant in the room when it comes to Social Health Insurance Act in Kenya,"The gazettement of the Social Health Insurance Act regulations signalled that Kenya’s UHC train was on the move. There were some key issues raised during public participation that were incorporated and others were not.

Households with salaried income would contribute monthly contributions of 2.75 percent was not capped at the proposed Sh5,000 as initially expected. The contribution shall not be less than Sh300 with remittance being done by the ninth day of every month including public service and county employees.

Whereas a household whose income is not derived from salaried employment shall contribute to the Social Health Insurance Fund (Shif) annually at a rate of 2.75 percent of the household income as determined by the means testing instrument prescribed in the regulations.

Why Kenyans are worried about the UHC rollout

The means testing, put simply would be an exercise to determine household composition and socio-economic aspects. One epidemiologist referred to it as “similar to a census only shorter”, focused on the determination and estimation of the household income for the payment of the premiums set out in the regulations.

Some experts have queried funding mechanisms to conduct the means testing exercise and will they leverage existing databases, particularly at the county level?

Nevertheless, the National Assembly would be able to appropriate funds for indigents (those who can’t pay as can’t afford necessities), vulnerable persons and persons under lawful custody.

Biometrics capture

Kenyans would, however, have to register anew including biometrics capture for both contributors and beneficiaries above 7 years old. All those above 18 years old would be expected to register as contributors. Those under 21 years old with no income or under 25 years old but enrolled in an institute of learning could remain as beneficiaries.

There were set guidelines involving the three funds that make up the Social Health Insurance Act, that is, the Primary Healthcare Fund, Shif and Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund.

The simplest is the government allocation or tax-funded Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund which would include contracted ambulance services. A shortlist of healthcare cases that would be considered emergencies from heart attacks to seizures was provided. Any accredited facility would be required to provide both resuscitation and stabilization services to any Shif member for a maximum of 24 hours. Members with chronic conditions would first utilize the benefits under Shif and once they exhaust their limits, could then access services under the Chronic fund.

The Primary Healthcare fund would cover care in healthcare facilities designated, levels 2 to 4. The essentials of Primary Healthcare Networks come into play as one starts with the lower-level facility and only presents to a higher-level facility upon receiving a referral note, apart from emergency services. How then would members know the facility levels? Previously, NHIF required members to select their nearest facility.

Why rural hospitals in Kenya have stopped accepting NHIF cards

SHIF, being the only contributory fund of the three would cater for services in levels 4 to 6 facilities which included specialized services. An excellent provision here is Mental Health and Palliative Services being covered.

Two crucial questions remain, ‘What would be the benefits?’ Following a member’s contribution what services would be covered and to what extent? The list of interventions to be included in the benefits package is still being discussed, by the Benefits Package and Tariffs Advisory Panel. On the other end of the spectrum, ‘What would healthcare facilities and providers be paid (Tariffs) for rendering these services?’.

The regulations clearly stated that the contributions made to the National Hospital Insurance Fund would be transferred to Shif and all data would be retained till all claims are settled to healthcare providers.

Adopt a bicycle for good health,"June 3 was the World Bicycle Day, which the United Nations General Assembly started celebrating in 2018. Its purpose is to educate the public on the benefits of cycling to health and the environment.

Exercise riding is the bicycle itself. Due to the advent of motorised vehicles, where the pollution has also increased, the physical exercise of man has also ended. Besides being pollution-free, cycling is helpful in obesity reduction and weight control.

In today’s fast-paced life, everybody wants to reach their destination in the blink of an eye. So, we left bicycles and started using motorised vehicles.

In earlier times, most people either walked or used bicycles. Because of that, they were physically active and fit. But as urbanisation increased, cycling also declined significantly. Most people own a car, whose excessive use harms the environment and health.

Bicycle rallies

When we get sick in the cycle of living a busy and ostentatious life, doctors advise us to do bicycle exercises. Then we spend money to ride a gym bike or use the treadmill. Why don’t we ride a bicycle for at least one hour a day, before the doctors tell us to?

Even in the olden times, the bicycle was considered a very important tool, especially because it was the most widely affordable and easiest way of transportation for people and goods. Bicycles were used by almost everyone—from farmers to students. For the poor, it was the main means of commute, by which they could easily go to work and school.

On World Bicycle Day, many local bicycle clubs and groups organise bicycle rallies and trips. Special programmes are organised to educate the youth about the benefits of bicycles. Bicycle races and competitions are held. This is not a one-day event but a long-term effort to promote cycling.

Curb theft of donor funds,"A task force formed by the government to ensure prudent use of donor funds should hit the ground running. This is a long-overdue bid to restore donors’ confidence in their funds being put to the intended uses. Comprising government officials and representatives of the donors, their brief is straightforward and there should be no dilly-dallying.

There is a need to enhance accountability in the management of these substantive funds provided for projects to improve the lives of disadvantaged Kenyans. The commitment of Sh2.6 trillion to some 256 projects in various parts of the country confirms the desire of the foreign well-wishers to complement the government’s development efforts.

The donors could have used this money in their own countries but, in a show of solidarity and cooperation, opt to assist Kenyans to initiate useful programmes. This is why it is only fair that donors are assured that their money will be put to the intended use.

This is also an opportunity to reduce government bureaucracy and enable expeditious rollout of projects. Quite welcome, too, is an agreement to create a mechanism to prepare the country to deal with disasters such as the recent heavy rains and floods and starvation and famine in the drought-prone areas.

National Treasury Principal Secretary Chris Kiptoo admits that the implementation of donor-funded projects has been hampered by numerous challenges, including low absorption of funds, court disputes and outright mismanagement. But the donors are still keen on increased co-operation.

The opacity that envelopes donor-funded projects often makes accountability difficult and yet there is misappropriation and outright theft. This must be stopped.

However, the government should not interfere in the NGOs’ funding of projects. The organisations should have a free hand to conduct their business as long as they are transparent.

Collaboration and innovation key to housing,"In Kenya, owning a home is seen as a lifetime achievement, a symbol of stability and success. Yet the country grapples with a persistent housing crisis. With a deficit of over two million units, the sector would have to supply at least 250,000 houses annually for some four years to bridge the gap.

While traditional home ownership models have long been the cornerstone of the housing dream, a more nuanced approach is needed.

The deficit is dire in major urban centres and is attributed to urbanisation and a growing population. Conventional home ownership often requires substantial upfront capital or lengthy mortgage or financing processes, locking out the majority low- and middle-income earners. The traditional rigid climb to full home ownership is no longer the only option. Rethinking the “home ownership ladder” requires looking beyond a single path.

Smaller loans

Emerging approaches to address housing affordability challenges include innovative rent-to-own schemes, where tenants build equity gradually to eventually own a home. Micro-mortgages provide smaller loans designed for those with limited income. Phased construction allows the building of a home in stages. Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company (KMRC) offers concessional, fixed long-term mortgages, further reducing the financial burden.

Combined, these approaches can create a more accessible housing market for Kenyans with diverse financial realities. Most Kenyans invest in land for speculation rather than developing it, creating ‘dead capital’. These investments tie up capital in undeveloped land, which remains unused for long periods, contributing little to addressing the immediate housing needs of the population. Developing these lands into habitable spaces can significantly alleviate the housing shortage.

Prefabricated construction

Innovative construction technologies, such as aluminium formwork or prefabricated construction, can make home ownership more attainable by reducing construction costs and time. By using new building technologies, developers can put up a house quicker with greatly improved quality and at lower cost. These technologies, which are environmentally friendly with reduced material wastage, not only ensure durability and quality but also make large-scale projects feasible, providing a practical solution to the housing deficit.

The government has a critical role in facilitating these new models—including streamlining regulations, enhancing tax incentives to developers driving the affordable housing agenda and developing infrastructure in underserved areas.

Besides, collaboration between financial institutions, developers and other relevant industry players can create innovative financing solutions and unlock the potential of these alternative models.

Redefining home ownership is not just about bricks and mortar but creating inclusive and sustainable communities. Fostering collaboration and embracing innovative solutions can bridge the housing gap and ensure access to decent and affordable homes for all.

Three more bodies exhumed in Shakahola as State suspends exercise,"Three bodies were on Wednesday exhumed in the Shakahola forest as the government suspended the exercise until Tuesday.

The total number of bodies that have been exhumed since last year now stands at 446.

The multi-agency team dug out the three bodies in three different areas which were part of the 50 graves sites identified for the search of remains of victims believed to have been followers of a cult linked to preacher Paul Mackenzie.

In the morning, detectives did not manage to get any bodies in the three suspected graves before extending their search to different areas deep in the vast forest where they recovered the three bodies.

According to sources within the multi-agency team, matching DNA might be more complicated for the remains exhumed in the ongoing fifth phase considering the state of decomposition.

“Most of the remains recovered on Wednesday were skeletons, an indication the bodies were buried more than two years ago,” said the source.

On Tuesday, government chief pathologist Johansen Odour confirmed the challenge the government is facing in preserving the bodies as the makeshift morgue at the Malindi sub-County hospital premises continues to fill up at a fast rate.

Dr Odour said families failing to come out to assist in the identification of the bodies remains a big challenge.

“Out of the 429 bodies exhumed in the previous four phases, 32 bodies of those exhumed have been released to their relatives for burial while others are yet to be claimed.

""We are asking more people who suspect their relatives might have disappeared from Shakahola to come out for DNA matching since the government has acquired adequate reagents to speed up the identification exercise,” Dr Odour said.

With bodies found buried less than 2 feet underground, the detectives suspect that the bodies were buried in haste.

At the 4,000-acre forest, the area remains abandoned and under tight security as it is still a crime scene and a disturbed area as gazetted by the government.

GSU officers have established camps with regular patrols conducted to keep off anyone from entering the forest sitting on the vast Chakama ranch.

"Rhonex Kipruto handed six years ban, stripped off 10km world record","Kenya’s Rhonex Kipruto will lose his 2019 world 10,000m bronze medal and the 10km world record from 2020 after he was handed a six-year ban for  doping.

Kipruto’s result from September 2018 will henceforth be expunged and will only remain with the world under-20 10,000m title from July 2018 in Tampere, Finland.

Kipruto’s ban came a day after the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) provisionally suspended 33 Kenyan athletes for various doping offences.

It also came nine days after AIU also banned Kenya’s Josephine Chepkoech for seven years as a repeat offender and for the use of a prohibited substance Testosterone.

Chepkoech, 35, could have been given eight years as a repeat offender, having been suspended back in 2012 but AIU reduced the sentence by one year after admission of the offence.

The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) moved swiftly to effect the tough sanction against the 24-year-old promising distance athlete after a Disciplinary Tribunal threw away his appeal and ruled that there were irregularities in his Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) resulting from doping.

Kipruto was provisionally suspended on May 11, last year for violating the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules (ADR)  after irregularities were detected in his ABP dating back to July 2018.

He is now banned until May 10, 2029 and will have some top honours disqualified.

However, Kipruto has the liberty to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

A statement from AIU indicated that after considering submissions from experts, the tribunal rejected Kipruto’s defence, concluding the “cause for the abnormalities in the ABP is more likely to be due to blood manipulation” such as through the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO).

The tribunal, made up of Tanja Haug (Chairman), Sentodji Roland Adjovi and Julien Berenger, ruled that Kipruto was involved in a deliberate and sophisticated doping regime over a long period of time in order to artificially enhance his performance through doping.

“Several abnormalities found in the Athlete’s ABP were linked to important competitions including the Valencia Half Marathon in 2020 and Kenyan Olympic trials in 2021,” the tribunal said.

The statement explained that blood doping outside of competitions can also be used to gain an advantage as it permits more intense training and this has an obvious effect on performance even after a significant period of time.

“This is corroborated by the fact that in recent years many athletes have been found positive for EPO far outside of competition,” said the tribunal.

Following the ban, Kipruto's 10km road-running world record in Valencia in 2020; 10,000m bronze medal in the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha and 10,000m victory in the 2019 Stockholm Diamond League, among many other honours, will now be annulled.

“The ABP is a critical tool in the quest to combat doping in elite athletes and this decision upholds important principles relating to ABP cases,” said AIU Head Brett Clothier.

Clothier said it can be difficult to directly detect the substances or methods used by sophisticated dopers, but the ABP gives them a chance to observe the telltale signs of blood doping over time.

For this reason, Clothier said AIU conducted more than 4,700 ABP tests in 2023 on elite athletes and that they will continue to invest heavily in our ABP programme going forward.

The ABP, introduced in 2009 to fight blood doping, is an electronic record that collects an athlete’s biological data over time to indirectly detect the effects of doping.

"Policeman storms forest station, kills two rangers and then ends his life","On Sunday night, Administration Police officer Evans Kimutai arrived at Cherangani Forest Station in Elgeyo Marakwet County where his girlfriend, a forest ranger, worked.

He had covered more than 300km from his work station at Todonyang Police Post in Turkana North sub-County in search of the said girlfriend.

It would later turn out that he was on a tragic mission.

Hours after his arrival, Cherangani Forest Station turned into a crime scene after the officer opened fire on Kenya Forest rangers, killing two and injuring one.

Then he turned the gun on himself to bring to an end his killing spree.

The young officer shot himself in the chin at the doorstep of the forest station manager.

When the gunshots finally went silent, three bullet-riddled bodies lay lifeless.

A third forest officer, Monica Kilonzi, sustained serious injuries on the upper right-side hand and right chest.

She was rushed to Kapcherop Health Centre before being transferred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret for medical attention. The three bodies were also taken to MTRH.

The assailant's girlfriend was not at the station at the time of the incident.

The forest officers who were killed have since been identified as Abdallah Dzabo Kitolle, 22, and Marion Jerono, 20.

Mr Kitolle, who was on duty as the night guard at the station, was killed as he attempted to alert three female officers.

He met his death at the doorstep where the two female officers were having dinner, after celebrating Madaraka Day at Kapsoar Sub County headquarters.

Mr Kitolle’s 21-year-old wife, Fatuma Omar, said her husband was barely worked for two years at the station.

“Abdalla was so caring and loving. He really loved me and our 10-month-old son,” said the young widow.

For the station manager, it was a lucky escape, as it appears the officer’s mission was to kill not just his girlfriend, but anyone in sight.

An AK-47 rifle was recovered at the scene of the crime. The assailant had three fully loaded magazines, of which he emptied one. Each magazine had 30 bullets.

The tragic Sunday night incident left Kapcherop Centre where the station is located in shock, as the forest officers and area residents struggled to come to terms with the tragic incident.

According to Elgeyo Marakwet County Police Commander Peter Mulinge, the heavily armed officer shot randomly, before killing the two KFS officers and injuring the third ranger.

Mr Mulinge said the assailant and his girlfriend had constantly differed. Their differences led the authorities to ban the assailant from the forest station.

According to the county police boss, the assailant's girlfriend was not at the forest station at the time of the incident.

According to officers at the station, the killer policeman claimed that some of his girlfriend's colleagues had been interfering in their relationship.

""We are still in shock following this incident. We call on young people to seek counseling from experts instead of taking matters into their own hands when facing relationship challenges,"" said area chief Andrew Chemaringo.

William Kimaiyo, an area resident, termed the incident as unfortunate, while calling on the government to ensure those recruited to join disciplined forces are young men and women of integrity.

""This incident has left us with a lot of pain as parents and residents, bearing in mind that the suspected killer was a well-known young man in this area. The government must be thorough in vetting youths joining disciplined forces to avoid such incidents,” said Mr Kimaiyo.

National Chief Conservator of Forests Alex Lemarkoko accompanied by senior KFS officers and a team of security officers from Kapsoar Sub County visited the station on Monday to assess the scene of crime and to condole with the families of the deceased officers.

“I had to fly from Nairobi to come and assess the situation upon learning that two of my officers had been killed by an assailant whom we have learned was a police officer from Turkana North. Unfortunately, we have lost two of our youngest officers,” said the KFS boss.

Mr Lemarkoko said police officers have embarked on investigations that will help KFS establish the root cause of the incident.

He, however, urged young people with relationship challenges to seek counselling instead of resorting to violence.

“As KFS we have a programme that we use to reach out to our officers. My advice to young people is that whenever they have relationship challenges they should always seek assistance from their seniors and other members of the society for guidance and counseling,” said Mr Lemarkoko.

Road to UHC - Universal Health Coverage isn’t free healthcare,"Most Kenyans heard that they would access healthcare services for free following the unveiling of Universal health coverage in October 2023.

A resounding commitment from the President as he assented to four health bills.

Then began the whispers of contribution payment with 2.75 per cent deductions from salaried employees.

The confusion set in when it was confirmed that contributions would not only be from those in formal employment, but those employed in the informal sector. For the latter group, the contributory process wasn’t clear.

It was apparent that Universal Health Coverage (UHC) would not be free, certainly not in the way most Kenyans had come to believe.

But what is UHC? Is it a vision, a mission or simply a campaign promise?

https://nation.africa/kenya/audio/why-kenyans-are-worried-about-the-uhc-rollout-4522284

As always in such cases, it is useful to start with a comparison with a country geographically not very far from ours, which has already succeeded in what we are now attempting. In this case, Botswana.

In sub-Saharan Africa, Botswana is a country that has attained Universal Health Coverage. Healthcare services are available at almost no cost to citizens.

Botswana’s health system remains dominated by the public sector with most services being rendered in public healthcare facilities.

The healthcare system is based on a primary healthcare model and according to Botswana’s Ministry of Health, health posts and clinics make up approximately 95 per cent of government health facilities.

Despite most of its population living in rural areas, people have access to public care. According to Unicef, an estimated 84 per cent of Botswana’s population lives within 5 kilometres of a health facility, while 95 per cent reside within a 15-kilometre radius of the nearest health facility.

According to a 2016 Health Policy Project funded by USAID, Botswana’s government funds the majority (57 per cent) of health expenditure with 54 per cent of government spending coming from domestic sources.

Therefore, reliance on donor funding isn’t as extensive, serving as both on and off-budget support.

Direct donor support is perhaps directed to program-specific initiatives such as HIV, TB and Malaria.

Healthcare infrastructure

While healthcare expenditure is also pooled through private healthcare insurance schemes, it was estimated to account for 39 per cent of the expenditure according to the report.

This means the out-of-pocket expenditure on health is minimal, estimated at less than 4 per cent. A stark contrast to Kenya’s healthcare expenditure breakdown where the majority is out-of-pocket.

Therefore, the country’s commitment to advancing healthcare is seen in its allocation of a significant portion of its budget to healthcare infrastructure.

According to the World Health Organisation, Botswana’s success can be seen in the establishment of an extensive network of primary healthcare facilities, focusing on preventive measures and ensuring essential services are readily available, including community outreaches.

Additionally, Botswana has made strong efforts to extend coverage under the public system to rural areas through mobile services. The current system of tax-financed health services has been successful in pooling risk, contributing to reductions in catastrophic expenditure and promotion of equity in health.

Botswana doesn’t have free healthcare, some services might be free, but most aren’t.

But the citizens enjoy healthcare services without having to sell parcels of land or travelling day and night to get care, as most do here in Kenya.

This brings us back to what is Universal health coverage (UHC)? As per the WHO definition, UHC means that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship.

It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.

Kenya’s progress towards UHC was marked by the enactment of four acts. These include the Primary Healthcare Act, Digital Health Act, Facility Improvement Financing Act and Social Health Insurance Act.

These ambitious healthcare reforms are meant to set Kenya on a path to Universal Health Coverage.

However, the regulation, operations and implementation processes remain to be the elephants in the room.

In this column, we seek to answer some of the questions on Kenyans’ minds and ask some of our own on this road to universal health coverage.

Man who was electrocuted at work sues Kenya Power Company,"On January 18, Nelson Wamboka Mangala went to work as usual, unaware of the imminent danger that would later change his life forever, leaving him disabled.

Mr Mangala has informed the High Court in Nairobi that he worked as a security guard and general cleaner at an apartment building in Ruaka.

Upon arriving at work that morning, he said he began cleaning the apartment buildings as usual. While cleaning one of the apartment units on the balcony he accidentally came into contact with low-hanging electric wires and was electrocuted.

He was rushed to Rua Family Hospital for emergency treatment.

However, his injuries were so severe that the medical staff at the hospital recommended his immediate transfer to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).

Low hanging electric cables

According to the court documents, at KNH Mr Mangala was diagnosed with severe burns on his face, right hand, left arm, forearm, and severe extensor injuries.

Consequently, he underwent and continues to undergo treatment at the hospital.

His treatment included escharectomy, fasciotomy, debridement, daily dressing changes, and surgery to amputate his right mid-forearm.

After the incident, Mr Mangala moved to court and sued Kenya Power Company to seek compensation for the injuries he sustained.

""The electrocution by the electric cables and the injuries the plaintiff sustained are a direct result of Kenya Power Company's negligent, reckless and liable conduct,"" he said through Mogaka Elkana Advocates.

Mr Mangala said that on the balcony of one of the apartments, the electric cables and wires were hanging very low.

Caused grievous injuries

""I was electrocuted while cleaning. I felt a strong electric surge passing through my body and immediately lost consciousness. I regained consciousness at the hospital, surrounded by my brother and doctors who appeared very concerned,"" he said.

Mr Mangala said that it was at that moment he realised he was in significant pain and had limited mobility due to the bandages covering his body.

""The hospital had to amputate my arm and start the rehabilitation process to address my injuries. I have been receiving treatment ever since the incident,"" he said.

The plaintiff has also highlighted Kenya Power's negligence as poor cable management and faulty wiring, which endangers the lives of people with faulty electrical cables.

Mr Mangala has also accused Kenya Power Company of failing to warn users about dangerous equipment and live electrical cables lying nearby.

The company, which is yet to file a response to the lawsuit, has also been accused of failure to repair live faulty cables that caused grievous injuries to the plaintiff.

Medical expenses

“Consequent to these injuries, the plaintiff is suffering immensely and has already incurred huge medical bills for corrective surgery and general treatment,” Mr Mangala's lawyers said in court.

According to documents filed in court, Mr Mangala has incurred Sh348,991 in medical expenses at KNH.

He also incurred medical expenses in other medical facilities before he was admitted at KHN for a total of Sh355,872.

“Despite issuing demands to Kenya Power Company, it has failed to make good the claim,” Mr Mangala told the court.

The plaintiff is seeking to be paid special damages amounting to Sh355,872, general damages for pain and suffering, loss of future earnings and future medical expenses.

“I pray for any other relief that this court may deem fit and just in the circumstances,” he said in the court documents.

US House passes Republican bill to sanction ICC over Israel,"The Republican-led US House of Representatives passed legislation that would impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court over its prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for Israeli officials related to the war in Gaza.

The vote was 247 to 155, with 42 Democrats joining Republicans in backing the measure.

There were no Republican ""nay"" votes, although two voted ""present.""

The measure is not expected to become law, but reflects continuing support for Israel in Congress amid international criticism over the Middle East country's campaign in the Gaza Strip.

Read: ICC prosecutor seeks warrants of arrest for Netanyahu, Hamas leaders

The White House last month criticized the ICC's decision to seek the warrants.

The bill is not expected to be brought up for a vote in the Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats.

The legislation, opens new tab would impose sanctions on people involved in ICC prosecutions of Americans or citizens of US allies that are not ICC members, including Israel.

It also would block such ICC officials' entry to the United States, revoke any U.S. visas and restrict them from US property transactions.

ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said last month - after more than seven months of war in Gaza - that he had reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Netanyahu's defense chief and three Hamas leaders ""bear criminal responsibility"" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Netanyahu said the ICC prosecutor's decision was absurd and that the move was meant to target all of Israel.

Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October, vowing to destroy Hamas after militants attack southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

About 120 hostages remain in Gaza.

The Israeli military campaign has killed more than 36,000 people in densely populated Gaza, according to its health authorities, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.

"Don't prosecute me, the law allows me to provide abortion services, medic argues in court","A clinical officer charged with the offence of providing abortion services has gone to court to challenge the legality of his arrest and prosecution.

Mr Gordon Akoyo is seeking a declaration that the arrest, detention and prosecution of him is illegal, arbitrary and in breach of the Constitution.

He also seeks a declaration that the arrest and prosecution of a trained health professional who provides abortion services is unlawful and in violation of the Constitution, the Health Act, the Sexual Offences Act and court precedents.

The petitioner stated that on September 5 last year, an unaccompanied minor, identified as ENM, arrived at a clinic with severe pain and heavy bleeding and asked for care, which he provided.

According to the petitioner, he received the minor at the age of 17 in his clinic, where she received emergency care, and upon examining her, came to the conclusion that the cause of the bleeding was severe menstrual bleeding and pain, or a miscarriage.

“While continuing to monitor ENM, electric power went out and the petitioner went to restore power. Upon the petitioner’s return to the examination room he found that she had left the facility without discharge,” the petition states.

Mr Akoyo says that on November 6 last year, he was summoned to Bamburi Police Station to record a statement regarding allegations of abortion.

The petitioner says that he was subsequently arrested and charged in Shanzu, where the court granted an application to detain him at Bamburi Police Station for five days for further investigation. Mr Akoyo says he was produced in court on November 15, charged and released on cash bail of Sh200,000.

He has challenged the charges against him, saying they are based on a mistaken belief by the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions that he provided abortion services and that abortion care is absolutely illegal in the country without regard to the Constitution.

In his petition to the High Court in Mombasa, Mr Akoyo has sued the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Inspector General of Police and the Senior Principal Magistrate of the Shanzu courts.

“The arrest and charge against the petitioner was made without any prior investigations into the alleged offence,” part of the petition states.

The petitioner claims that there was no inquiry on whether he was qualified and licensed to offer abortion care in line with the constitution, statutory and policy provisions and judicial precedents on abortion care in Kenya.

He adds that being arrested and detained for seven days on the alleged provision of abortion services, denied police cash bail and denying the opportunity to practice his trade and subsequent prosecution amounted to abuse and psychological torture.

“Arresting and charging the petitioner without regard to the constitution, statutes and prevailing judicial precedents on the law of abortion in the country creates a chilling effect not only for him but other reproductive healthcare providers across the country and limits their ability to fulfil their professional and constitutional obligations,” the petition states.

He argues that lack of clarity on the implementation of Article 26 (4) of the constitution has created fear and confusion among healthcare professionals, including himself, on the status of abortion in the country and violates the right to equality and freedom from discrimination.

The Article in question, under the Right to Life, states that ""Abortion is not permitted unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law.""

Mr Akoyo is also seeking an order quashing the charge sheet against him at the Shanzu Law Courts.

Furthermore, he wants a permanent injunction issued barring the DPP from prosecuting any health-trained professional providing abortion care as stipulated under Article 26 (4) of the constitution and the Health Act.

The High Court on Wednesday suspended the hearing of the case against Mr Akoyo at the Shanzu Law Courts pending the hearing and determination of his petition.

The case will be mentioned on July 29 for parties to highlight their submissions.

‘Summit all seven continents’ highest mountains’: Cheruiyot Kirui's ultimate ambition,"Late mountaineer Joshua Cheruiyot Kirui, who died two weeks ago while attempting to scale Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, had dreams of becoming the first Kenyan to achieve the so-called Explorers Grand Slam.

His teammates from the Ultra Runners Kenya Club made the revelation during the funeral service held at Chepterit Primary School Grounds in Chepterit, Nandi County.

To achieve the Explorers Grand Slam or the Adventurers Grand Slam as it is also known, one has to summit all the seven highest mountains on each continent.

Bringing the body down is a risky and costly affair, depending on a number of factors, according to one of the late Kirui's close hiking friends, Limo Kipkemoi.

You would also have to reach the North and South Poles.

At the funeral service attended by family, neighbours, friends and colleagues of the late Cheruiyot, framed photographs of the late mountaineer on the summits of various mountains were placed along the tents where the mourners sat.

It was a fitting reminder to the people of Chepterit, who turned out in large numbers for the memorial service, that Cheruiyot was not only their son but also a son of the mountains.

On May 17, 2024, Kenyan hiker Cheruiyot Kirui posted this photo on his Instagram page before embarking on the Mt Everest climb.

Some of the teachers who taught Cheruiyot at Chepterit Primary School, where his funeral service was held, eulogised the late mountaineer as a humble student.Although they noted that Cheruiyot was a shy student, they attributed his quest to conquer the mountains to his hardworking nature and desire to excel in whatever he did.

His friend Peter Muhia and a teammate at Ultra Runners Kenya, speaking on behalf of hikers, said that climbing Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, as difficult as it was, was not the banker's ultimate goal.

Becoming the first Kenyan and one of the few Africans to complete the Explorers GrandSlam was his dream, Mr Muhia revealed.

Having already climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, Cheruiyot would have had five more mountains to climb after Everest before embarking on a journey to the opposite ends of the Earth's surface - the North and South Poles.

The North Pole is defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface.

""One day when we were climbing Mount Kenya with Cheruiyot, I asked him what would happen after we climbed Everest. He told me that after conquering the highest mountain in Asia, in January next year (2025), we would climb Mount Aconcagua in Argentina (the highest in South America) before planning to climb the other peaks,"" said Muhia, who was supposed to climb Everest with Cheruiyot before changing his mind.

The summits conquered on the way to the Explorer's GrandSlam include: Mount Everest (Asia), Mount Kilimanjaro (Africa), Denali - also known as Mount McKinley (North America), Aconcagua (South America), Vinson Massif (Antarctica), Mount Elbrus (Europe), Mount Kosciuszko (Australia) and Carstensz Pyramid (Indonesia), considered the only technical rock climb of the expedition.

Mountaineers paid tribute to Cheruiyot as a brave and dedicated athlete whose passion served as an inspiration to those around him.

Explaining to the mourners on behalf of the family the decision to leave Cheruiyot's body on Everest's summit, Muhia said the process of retrieving the body was too dangerous and would probably have cost other lives.

He added that Cheruiyot was an experienced mountaineer and a lover of the mountains and his death was an accident.

""We climbed Mount Manaslu (Nepal) with Cheruiyot in September last year and we set a record by becoming the first Africans ever to reach the summit of this mountain, which is over 8,000m high, without supplemental oxygen and a guide. I will say that Cheruiyot was a very experienced mountaineer and his love for the mountains was unparalleled. I know that in time, some of us will make it to the summit of Mount Everest and we will see Joshua's body,"" said Muhia.

Born in 1984 in Kapsabet, Nandi, to Ruth and Wilson Kenduiywo, he was the second child in a family of five.

His mother confirmed in an earlier interview that Cheruiyot had shown an adventurous spirit at an early age when he could climb tall trees in their compound to the top.

Overwhelmed with emotion, the mother had little to say at the service, except to pay tribute to her son as a ""special child"".

""When God gave you to me, I gave you back to him for his care and provision. I know he has received you and you belong to him. Amen,"" her tribute read.

His father eulogised him as a confident and determined person whose passion for mountaineering had made him an icon.

The late Cheruiyot's colleagues at Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) remembered him as a hardworking team player who inspired others to give their best.

Caroline Wanjeri, the Director of the Mortgage Division at KCB, who read the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Russo's message of condolence, described Cheruiyot as a 'Star performer in the bank' whose immense contribution to the growth of the business saw him bank the company's Prestigious Simba award at some point.

Cheruiyot joined the bank in 2009 as a management trainee at the KCB Nandi Hills branch before rising to become senior relationship manager, corporate mortgages at the time of his death.His professionalism saw him carefully balance his work with his passion for social and outdoor activities, achieving immense success in both. Before he was reported missing and his body was finally found on 22 May just metres from the summit of Mount Everest, Cheruiyot had climbed several mountains, including Mount Manaslu (8,163m), Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Ruwenzori, Mount Longonot and Mount Kenya more than 20 times.

He has also completed over 50 marathons and several ultra-marathons (over 50km).

Debunking marriage myths,"Some years ago, when the fourth president of Kenya was sworn into office, I happened to be on an assignment with a government agency. For some reason, someone started a rumour that I was a niece to the then First Lady. The more I tried to debunk the story, the more it gained traction.

“Oh my, you look a lot like your aunt, short hair, and you speak alike!” What?

Read: Is marriage worth the cost for women?

“We are not even from the same community.” Some people wanted to know how to get government tenders. “Could you connect me to the Ministry? I know you can…” They thought I was trying to be humble when I said I was not related to the First Family. Of course, others thought I was just being stingy. One morning, as I drove in to hustle for a parking space like the rest of the Kenyans in the building, which had limited slots and was allocated on a first-come basis, a security guard ran up to my car, smiling. I could have sworn he was about to salute/ I smiled back.

“Madam, we have a parking slot for you.” That is probably the best greeting a Nairobian jostling for free parking would love to hear. I kid you not, but he ushered me into a VIP parking lot. It helped that I drove a big machine then, which perfectly fit amongst the rest. And that folk is how I enjoyed free VIP parking for months and the occasional salute. A lady cannot protest too much now, can she? That too is how fake news spreads, a phenomenon called the illusionary truth effect.

The illusion of truth describes how when we hear the same false information repeated time and again, we often come to believe it is true, in what is also referred to as the law of propaganda. ‘Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth.’ Repetition might make a statement seem truer, but it remains a lie or a myth.

We have loads of these in marriages. A repetition of statements, passed down from one generation to the next encultures us to believe them to be true. Let us debunk some of the lies about marriage.

Marriage is a life sentence.

No, it is a voluntary commitment, intended for a lifetime of love, friendship, and companionship. But these do not always happen, and therefore, one can exit an abusive marriage, where love, friendship, and respect are no longer served.

The husband is the provider.

A husband’s most critical role is to protect his wife and children, not from wild animals but from the vagaries of life, with his arms and words. It does not matter how much he provides if he does not accompany that with the protection of his family. Unfortunately, some ill-informed husbands are the perpetrators of hurt against the very people they should protect.

Fighting for a marriage makes it work

If a marriage is already in ICU, even the juju man will not help you turn it around. Remember, marriage is a voluntary relationship between two adults. It will take the two of you to work together for a healthy thriving relationship.

Marriage is 50/50

It is 100% or it is not a marriage. You give your all, and they do the same. If anyone puts in less than one hundred percent, then that is an exploitative relationship, serving only one of you, the one putting in less than one hundred percent.

Happy marriages have no fights

All human relationships experience conflict. Marriage is no exception. The only difference is how the conflict is handled. You will occasionally differ, but healthy couples agree to disagree, and most importantly, when both feel safe to table any issue, that is a happy and healthy union. Research in fact demonstrates that conflict is healthy, as it allows everyone to express themselves, to feel heard and seen in the relationship.

Marriage sex is boring

That is a big lie. The most intense and intimate sexual experiences are within a committed relationship. People express themselves best when there are no inhibitions when they fully trust the person they are with, and when they aim to please each other. Things get better and deeper with time when dealing with a long term partner than with a stranger.

His people become your people

You two are to form your own boma and create your family culture, otherwise, some in-laws will as soon part you than unite you.

What else have you heard about marriage that with time you have realized was untrue?

Meet Dr Elizabeth Kuta, also known as, DJ Branula or DJ Dr Kuta. Dr Kuta is a neonatologist and a doctor for newborn babies. Those who have met her along the hospital corridors say she is extremely good with the babies.

For 15 years, Dr Kuta has been at it, ensuring that newborns receive the best care they can get to survive the dicey formative years of life.

But beyond the hospital corridors, Ms Kuta wears another hat - she is an entertainer!

Once she hangs up her stethoscope and the doctor's dust coat, Dr Kuta picks up her headphones to pursue her other passion.

For seven years, DJ Dr Kuta has juggled the two roles, which are worlds apart.

Just the same way syringes and needles dance between her fingers is the same way they skilfully move on the mixer. Her spinning technique, knowledge, and mastery of all music genres leave many people in awe. More so when they eventually learn that she is a staff at the Aga Khan Hospital child health section.

“Becoming a DJ had always been my dream career while growing up in Western Kenya. I, however, ended up becoming a medical doctor after doing well in my national exams,” says Dr Kuta.

Despite attending medical school, graduating as a medic, and securing a well-paying job, nothing could stop her from practising her dream career in music.

DJ Branula discloses that what she appreciates most about being a DJ is the music helps calm her nerves after a long week at work.

“Medicine happens to be my main career, but during weekends and my free time, I enjoy working as a DJ or spending time with my family,” says the medic, who adds that she is also a mother and a wife.

Dr Kuta attributes her passion for music to her father, who loved to play music over the weekend.

""However, I was not sure how to approach my parents or teachers with the idea. You know during that time, music was not considered a serious career,"" she says.

While still in primary school, one of her relatives planned a wedding. Dr Kuta and her two sisters were to present a song during the ceremony.

“I could tell that my sisters performed well by the response from the crowd. But when it got to my turn, I heard someone whisper that I was struggling with my vocals,” lamented Dr Kuta.

Even though she was still determined to pursue a career in music despite the poor presentation, the medic was certain that singing would not be part of that ambition.

But while selecting degree courses to pursue at the university, Dr Kuta chose civil engineering. However, her parents persuaded her to go for medicine.

“Had someone asked me at that time what I wanted to pursue, I'm telling you I could have chosen something related to music. Maybe I would have selected a course in DJ if we had such an option in the list,"" she says.

""What I remember however is that during those days, securing a chance to study medicine in a public university was a huge privilege.”

As fate would have it, she eventually joined Moi University, Eldoret, to study medicine. After six years, she moved to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, Kisumu, for an internship. That was in 2009.

Dr Kuta explains the desire to become a DJ was rekindled briefly while in Kisumu, but she could not find a school to enrol in.

When she returned to Moi University for a master's course in Pediatrics, a friend helped her to find a music school.

“I shared my dream of becoming an artist with her and despite not taking me seriously she still helped me to get into a school,” says Dr Kuta.

She enrolled at Mwafrika Sounds in Eldoret, immediately paid a third of the fees, and settled for the lessons. Although the training was to take three months, it dragged on for nine months since the medic had to balance classwork, hospital rounds and music training.

The medic says she would join her teacher during events and practice whatever she missed in class.

The doctor says by the time she graduated, she had also qualified to become a DJ.

“I find satisfaction working as a doctor, somedays, we lose, sometimes we win but the joy of treating a patient and seeing them respond to treatment can never be explained,” Dr Kuta beams.

She says that her dedication to medicine saw her win a fellowship to pursue a course in neonatology. She is the only practising neonatologist in Kisumu County.

Meanwhile, in any given free time, when not doing her research in the medical field, one is likely to find the doctor either performing at events, updating her music genre list or performing as a DJ to her close family members back in the house.

The paediatrician says working as a DJ and a health worker has helped her build a relationship that cuts across with clients.

On some occasions, she always meets some of her clients while performing with surprises written all over their faces.

“After meeting the clients out there during the gigs, interacting with them at the hospital is always quite interesting,” says Dr Kuta, who hopes to retire one day from the medical field and continue practising as a DJ.

Dr Kuta says that after hiding from her father her DJ life for years, she eventually gathered the courage to break the news to him by sending him a picture taken while she was performing.

""As expected he was appalled. He couldn't believe it at first until he saw me in action during a family event. He finally accepted and moved on, after all I am still practising the career he chose for me,"" she adds.

Last year, the medic had a chance to DJ for her family during her mother's graduating ceremony as a pastor.

""From their reactions, I could tell that they were happy with the performance,"" she says.

Dr Kuta, however, does not perform in nightclubs. This, she says, is because the crowd in clubs is always ""a little complicated.""

Even while performing at events over the weekends, the DJ says she always informs her colleagues to be on standby to hold in brief for her in case of emergencies.

“I also keep my phone close and advise the nurses on duty to call more than once in case I fail to pick. I am however glad that since I started practicing as a DJ, I have never had a situation that specifically requires my attention while performing in events,” says Dr Kuta.

"30 years of climate talks: Minimal progress, crucial stakes for Africa","In Bonn, Germany

As experts gather in Bonn for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a palpable sense of urgency and frustration.

Over the past thirty years, these international climate talks have aimed to tackle the worsening environmental crisis. However, many maintain that there has been little progress, prompting crucial questions about the importance and impact of these talks, particularly for Africa.

""Adaptation is a critical issue for Africa. That is why it is always on the agenda. But there is yet to be progress on National Adaptation Plans,"" Obed Koringo, a climate policy expert from Care International, says.

""I have been a climate negotiator for five years,"" Marlene Achoki from the Kenya delegation says. The progress has not been as fast as we expected, and that can get frustrating. But we have to keep going because we have been seeing some progress, especially on issues around adaptation.""

The Stakes for Africa

Despite being the lowest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, the African continent experiences the greatest impact of climate change. It faces rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall patterns, devastating droughts, and an increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events. These changes pose significant threats to food security, access to water, and the well-being of millions of people. The African Group has consistently emphasised Africa's vulnerability to these climate challenges, underscoring the critical importance of the outcomes of climate talks for African nations.

""Look at the flooding that happened recently in Kenya. More than 200 people died. That is the kind of climate disaster we are experiencing on the continent. Who is going to compensate us for that? That is why we must be here,"" says Anne Tek, a climate justice expert with FEMNET.

""As a continent, it is important that we participate in these talks. This is the only way we get our voices heard, and by being here, we speak on behalf of our people. They have given us the mandate to tell the world what is happening back home and find solutions,"" Marlene says.

""If we don't participate in climate talks, then we would have failed the continent. The progress is slow, but it doesn't mean we give up,"" Obed says.



Why the Talks Matter

Platform for Advocacy:For African countries, climate negotiations are a vital platform to advocate for their distinct needs and perspectives. These discussions ensure that the voices of those most affected yet least responsible are heard on the global stage. This advocacy is crucial for pushing for policies and funding addressing the specific climate challenges African communities face.

Funding and Support:One critical aspect of the climate talks is the discussion of financial aid from developed countries to developing ones. This support is vital for Africa to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies. Although the promised $100 billion per year in climate finance from developed nations has fallen short, continued negotiations aim to hold these countries accountable and ensure that Africa receives the necessary funds.

Technology Transfer: Climate talks also facilitate discussions on technology transfer from developed to developing countries. Access to advanced technology can help African nations leapfrog to cleaner and more efficient energy systems, build climate-resilient infrastructure, and create sustainable agricultural practices.

Global Solidarity: These talks underscore the principle of worldwide solidarity and shared responsibility. They emphasise that the climate crisis is a collective problem requiring collective action. Africa's participation in these negotiations underscores its commitment to being part of the global solution despite its limited resources and contributions to the problem.

The road ahead

While the progress over the past 30 years may seem slow and insufficient, abandoning the climate talks is not an option for Africa. The stakes are too high, particularly for Africa.

""The United Nations Climate Change framework provides guidelines and rules under which all countries engage on climate change, in what is known as a multilateral process. These rules of engagement provide an equal playing field for everyone to come to the table and talk. This is the only place where people will listen,"" Julius Mbatia, a climate policy expert,

The Bonn talks are intended to prepare for the annual mega-conference on climate change, known as the Conference of Parties (COP), and typically involve highly technical discussions. In Bonn, the agenda for the COP is developed. As the newly elected chair of the African Group of Negotiators, Kenya is leading these talks and will also champion the continent's climate agenda at COP 29 later this year.

"Reject new tax proposals, manufacturers urge MPs","More than 500 organisations that have submitted views on the Finance Bill, 2024 are opposed to the introduction of taxes on bread, cooking oil, vehicles, excise duty and VAT on financial services, the eco levy and levies on electric cars.

The stakeholders who appeared before the National Assembly Finance and Planning Committee, asked lawmakers to zero-rate the products and cushion Kenyans from the high cost of living.

The organisations took issue with the 16 per cent VAT on bread and 25 per cent on crude and refined vegetable oils, saying it would push the cost of these essential commodities out of reach of ordinary families.

Appearing before the team chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani, the organisations demanded the rejection of the proposal to impose VAT on financial services and an increase of excise duty on the services from the current 15 to 20 per cent.

Read: Financial experts warn MPs against passing Finance Bill as proposed

They also opposed the imposition of VAT on forex transactions, processing of cheques as well as the 10 to 20 per cent rise in the cost of M-Pesa and money transfer charges.

The industry players want the deletion of the proposal to impose an annual 2.5 per cent motor vehicle tax based on the value of the vehicle and the eco levy of Sh150 per kilogramme on articles of plastic packaging materials.

The National Treasury expects to make least Sh58 billion from the motor vehicle tax. The Finance Bill, 2024 seeks to raise Sh302 billion to finance the Sh3.9 trillion budget for 2024/25 financial year.

According to the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), the eco levy – some Sh150 per kilo of plastic packaging – would increase the prices of plastic packaging materials, batteries and hygiene products.

If the levy is passed, KAM argues, the cost of a loaf of bread will increase by Sh9 to Sh74; a litre of cooking oil by Sh16.81 to Sh316.81 while the price of a kilogramme of power detergent will go up by Sh30 to Sh230.

“If implemented as is, the bill will increase the cost of production, thereby destroying industry competitiveness, and subsequently, dent our local and export markets. It will lead to an increase in retail prices...and cash flow requirement when the environment is characterised by rising interest rates,” KAM Chief Executive Anthony Mwangi said.

Read: New vehicle sales drop 17pc on high taxes, interest rates

“This will render local industries uncompetitive, which will push them to either downsize, move to more competitive countries or close down.”

Edible oil manufacturers said the implication of the excise duty adjustments on raw and refined vegetable oils would see the price of a 400g loaf of bread increase by Sh10.

The effects would extend to other products derived from the oils, with the price of long bar soap likely to shoot from Sh200 to ShSh350 and 250g margarine to be sold for Sh300 from Sh160.

The Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI) asked MPs to reject the car tax and the introduction of VAT on insurance services.

AKI said the 16 per cent VAT would be passed to consumers and increase premiums.

The organisations also opposed new taxes on electric vehicles, arguing it would kill the industry.

The zero rating of the supply of electric bicycles, motorcycles, cars and buses was introduced by the Finance Act, 2023 as an incentive to the growth of e-mobility and encourage the adoption of the vehicles.

Mr Hezbon Mose, the President of the Electric Mobility Association of Kenya, said withdrawing the incentive only a year after it was introduced may be premature, considering that there was a 500 per cent acceleration of the uptake the vehicles in the period of the incentive, and that investments grew significantly.

A consortium of mobile devices assemblers, including Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom, said President William Ruto’s pledge that Kenya would make handsets valued at less than $50 phone would not be realised with the imposition of VAT.

The bill proposes 16 per cent VAT on locally assembled mobile phones, currently zero-rated.

“The impact of VAT on East Africa Device Assembly Kenya Ltd (EADAK) is that it will increase the retail price of Neon Smarta to Sh8,699 from Sh7,499,” said Johnstone Kamunde, the EADAK Chief Finance Officer.

“The cost of Neon Ultra phone will rise to Sh10,439 from Sh8,999. This is a Sh1,440 rise. The 16 per cent VAT will be borne by the customer.”

Hustle in the ‘hood: Beware of dream-jackers,"My definition of a dream-jacker is someone or something that seizes a person or people's hopes, dreams and aspirations by force or through false pretenses. The items seized can be concepts, ideas, creations, intellectual property, innovations or inventions.

Dream-jackers pilfer gems and generational wealth. Some dream-jackers use witchcraft to kill, steal and destroy destinies. Others use more subtle and sophisticated means to hijack dreams. And it's these subtle types I want to talk about.

Crime and social vices are dream-jackers. A young cat can be caught up in a (lifestyle) trap; which may lead him to an early grave, jail or spending the rest of his life on Regretters Road. I’ve witnessed dream-jackers - such as addictions and criminality - casting lengthy (and sometimes permanent) eclipses on brilliant brothers smack in the noontide of their lives.

Experience

Disclaimer: Sometimes subtle dream-jackers are not even aware of what they are doing. They may have the best intentions. But, as the saying goes; the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

In August 1998, Gilbert and I had the idea of doing a flower hawking business. Gilbert and I lived in the same ‘hood - Jericho Estate - and we just wanted to make our money the legit way.

We had a neighbour who used to work at a flower-exporting firm. We went to ask for her advice. Before Gilbert and I knew it, we were reporting to this boss lady.

Read: How to turn rejection into a blessing

Boss Lady bought the flowers and said she would be our supplier. But we were ‘hood hustlers. We knew she'd done a switcheroo. We were now employees.

Well? That hustle dried up faster than fresh roses.

The same script replayed itself several years later. Another hommie and I wanted to start up a mitumba shoes business. We shared the idea with a moneyed neighbour.

Long story short? Mr. Moneybags bought several bales of mitumba shoes and asked us to sell them for a commission. There's a difference between starting somewhere and starting from an idea that's been stolen from you. We weren't as enthusiastic about the biz as we would've been had it been ours. Which is why it died a quick death.

Gifted, grifters and gatekeepers

I get it. Every rat wants to get ahead in the race. And sometimes - (but this I don’t get, though) - this entails stealing other dogs’ bones so you can be the Top Dawg.

The creative industry is full of dream-jackers. In this space, there are three types of players; gifted, grifters and gatekeepers. Oftentimes, the gifted - those who have “it” - don't have the wherewithal to actualise their dreams. Grifters - who usually masquerade as gifted - are often loaded with dough, followers and connections, and want a pound of the gifted's flesh. On the other hand, gatekeepers are persons or systems that control access to influence and finances.

Clarification: The gifted can also be grifters and/or gatekeepers.

Dreamer beware

Listen, baby. Protect your baby at all costs. Dreams aren't meant to be shared with just any Tom, Dick or Harriet. Don't be too quick to do reveals for your babies.

Read: Every man needs a good bad friend

This town is full of shysters who want to eat other people's sweat, then feed your carcass to the hounds. Which is why you should always be on your toes.

When pitching a concept, have a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). If the person or parties are averse to signing an NDA, it will tell you they are potential dream-jackers. And if you must reveal the concept sans NDA, drop them just a morsel.

Here's the whole truth and nothing but. Only the dream-carrier can actualise an idea the way it was destined. If, say, grifters and gatekeepers jack a morsel of your dream, you still have a mound at your disposal.

Peace.

Dramatic photo finish at Sardinia Rally just what WRC ordered,"Ott Tanak, the Estonian 2019 world rally champion is a very lucky man.

He is also and a good example of how fickle and unpredictable rallying is.

Tanak was destined to a second place finish in last weekend's WRC Sardinia Italy behind Frenchman eight times world champion Sebastien Ogier until 3km from the finish in the very last section when he took the lead with the smallest margins possible, almost a dead heat finish.

Tanak was only concerned about scoring construction championships points for Hyundai Motorsports while safeguarding his second overall position.

His team had earlier intervened and urged him to gun for the constructors points for Hyundai instead of taking unnecessary risks trying to challenge Ogier for the lead after Saturday's action.

Tanak was the quickest driver in the morning loop on Saturday. But Ogier turned on the pressure to win the afternoon loop and end the day with maximum 18 points, three better than the Estonian and with a 17.1 seconds lead.

But Tanak did not relent and whittled this lead to 6.02seconds as the drivers entered the Sassari Power Stage before drama unfolded.

Ogier suffered a puncture 3km from the finish of the stage, and lost by two tenths of a second (0.2), or simply put being edged out in an Olympics 100 metres photo finish dash.

Winning time

Tanak’s 0.2 seconds winning time equalled a similar margin between Ogier and Toyota Gazoo racing team principal Jari-Matti Latvala in 2011 WRC Jordan. The Frenchman was the victor.

This is the second time Ogier has lost Sardinia at the same stage after the 2019 misfortune when he suffered steering problems.

These results also confirm how evenly matched the current generation of WRC drivers have become and also the surge and form of the Hyundai car and team this season.

However, the highlight of Sardinia was the successful implementation of recommendations done by a work group appointed by the FIA last December to make the WRC more attractive and competitive.

The group proposed varied changes which will make each round of the WRC distinctive and divided into sprints and endurance on one side; and also characterised by the prevailing geographical and climatic conditions of each leg.

This has divided the WRC into asphalt, tarmac and ice.

This year’s Sardinia was the third round of the asphalt rallies after WRC Safari Rally and WRC Portugal.

Conditions were dry but some sections really rough like the stage which knocked off current championship leader Belgian Thierry Neuville on Saturday.

New sprint format

He was forced to retire but rejoined the rally on Sunday to safeguard his points lead which was reduced by six by Elfyn Evans.

Neuville has 122 points and Evans 104, same as Tanak. Ogier has 92 and Adrien Fourmaux of France 74.

The rally, though tough, was also reduced to a 48 hours sprint in a new format, which, if it proves popular will turn the WRC into a two and a half days affair instead of three to four days as has been the tradition with all WRC rounds.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia joined the WRC circuit from 2026, and for the next 10 years.

Rally Saudi Arabia promises to showcase the country’s diverse and challenging landscapes on surfaces ranging from volcanic rock to sandy desert terrain, providing a novel test for crews with conditions never previously encountered in WRC history.

While Saudi Arabia is a newcomer to the WRC, it boasts a proven track record with a multitude of international sporting events hosted there including the Dakar Rally, Formula 1, football, and golf.

HRH Prince Khalid Bin Sultan Al Abdullah Al-Faisal, Chairman of the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation and the Saudi Motorsport Company, was delighted to welcome WRC to Saudi Arabia.

The costly price of period poverty: Turkana schoolgirls skip classes,"Most girls in public schools in Turkana County who have attained puberty are missing classes because of unreliable and uncoordinated supply of sanitary towels.

The situation is worse for girls from poor backgrounds and in remote areas where they can't afford the pads when on their menses. Such girls opt to stay at home than feel ashamed.

In a spot check at public institutions, teachers confirmed that the national government has yet to provide free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels to every girl who should at least get nine packs of pads per academic year.

Read: Where are the free pads for schoolgirls?

The situation is forcing development partners of specific schools for donations with varied interests, with getting those committed to sustainably take up the task for many years being difficult.

In Kataboi Girls Secondary School and adjacent Kataboi Junior Secondary School in Turkana North with a total population of 700 students, for instance, school principal Omaido Robella always reach out to partners and well-wishers to support the girls every term.

Ms Robella says she understands family background of her girls and leaving them on their own to tackle menstrual hygiene is an uphill task that will not only expose them to sex predators and have a negative impact on their future if some of them decide to drop out of school.

“Not all students in the school can afford the sanitary kits because of poor background. Others don't even carry soaps to wash their panties. This is why I am always engaging partners to help.”

She recalled the most successful activity is when the school hosted well-wishers under Arsenal Turkana Chapter and more than six partners through a day’s event dubbed 'Pads for Love'.

On the outskirts of Lodwar town, the Church Mission Network targeted poor families in Natapar Kakono, Nakwamekwi and Kanam Kemer with relief food and free washable sanitary towels that can last for five years when well taken care of.

Read: Call for special sanitary pads budget for schools

A parent, Jane Esinyen, said washable sanitary towels was a relief for her as despite being near Lodwar town, she can't afford pads for her two girls when the government delay to supply them as it is in the current situation.

“Without help, my girls have been missing classes for fear of staining their school uniform and being ridiculed. They see themselves as being dirty, unhygienic and impure,"" Ms Esinyen said.

Turkana Governor Jeremiah Lomorukai's wife Lillian Ekamais stressed the need for coordinated distribution of sanitary towels so that no girl is disadvantaged.

At Lodwar Mixed Primary school, with support from partners, she distributed 2,300 dignity kits, 2,600 packets of disposal pads and 550 reusable pads, and other items to support schoolgirls.

Ms Ekamais challenged partners to not only target schools within major towns but also reach out to border schools on Kibish and Turkana East as well as prioritise menstruation education as its negligence has led to infections among girls.

County Chief Officer for Preventive and Promotive Health Cathra Abdi regretted that stigma surrounding menstruation and a lack of sanitary pads had affected and forced girls to leave school.

She announced that her department would map out committed partners for strategic provision of sanitary towels across the county and raise awareness of menstrual health hygiene among adolescent girls.

Teachers, especially in secondary schools with high enrolment of girls, called on the government and development partners to install incinerators for hygienic disposal of used menstrual clothes and sanitary towels.

Dramatic photo finish at Sardinia Rally just what WRC ordered,"Ott Tanak, the Estonian 2019 world rally champion is a very lucky man.

He is also and a good example of how fickle and unpredictable rallying is.

Tanak was destined to a second place finish in last weekend's WRC Sardinia Italy behind Frenchman eight times world champion Sebastien Ogier until 3km from the finish in the very last section when he took the lead with the smallest margins possible, almost a dead heat finish.

Tanak was only concerned about scoring construction championships points for Hyundai Motorsports while safeguarding his second overall position.

His team had earlier intervened and urged him to gun for the constructors points for Hyundai instead of taking unnecessary risks trying to challenge Ogier for the lead after Saturday's action.

Tanak was the quickest driver in the morning loop on Saturday. But Ogier turned on the pressure to win the afternoon loop and end the day with maximum 18 points, three better than the Estonian and with a 17.1 seconds lead.

But Tanak did not relent and whittled this lead to 6.02seconds as the drivers entered the Sassari Power Stage before drama unfolded.

Ogier suffered a puncture 3km from the finish of the stage, and lost by two tenths of a second (0.2), or simply put being edged out in an Olympics 100 metres photo finish dash.

Winning time

Tanak’s 0.2 seconds winning time equalled a similar margin between Ogier and Toyota Gazoo racing team principal Jari-Matti Latvala in 2011 WRC Jordan. The Frenchman was the victor.

This is the second time Ogier has lost Sardinia at the same stage after the 2019 misfortune when he suffered steering problems.

KQ extends freeze on staff complimentary tickets,"Kenya Airways (KQ) has extended a freeze on a complimentary scheme that allows its staff to travel for free amid an investigation into abuse of the initiative.

The scheme called buddy pass entitles the airline’s employees to two free flights a year, each accompanied by up to four other passengers. It allows staff to nominate family and friends within specified limits and clear accompanying rules.

The scheme has, however, been abused by some KQ employees prompting the airline to suspend it in April, pending investigations that were initially scheduled to end on May 17.

KQ has since extended the suspension of the scheme beyond a revised May 31 date it had earlier indicated.

“The suspension of the buddy pass programme at Kenya Airway is still on. We have suspended it by a few more days as per the last memo I issued to staff,” said KQ chief people officer Tom Shivo.

The national carrier has begun dismissing staff members found guilty of abusing the buddy pass privilege.

Although buddy passes are normal in the airline industry, the best practice requires that staff do not benefit commercially from the scheme, the same way work-related benefits should not be passed on to third parties.

Other airlines offer an employee one free ticket a year and unlimited tickets for family members and friends at a set percentage of the full fare with close monitoring to discourage commercialisation.

Some international airlines require staff to submit a list of immediate family members and dependents at the beginning of the year, subject to review after six months, and with no option of selling to third parties.

Under Resolution 788 of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which provides for free or reduced fare transportation to an employee for an air carrier, the immediate family — spouse, children, parents, brothers, sisters, and dependants — are listed as the beneficiaries of a buddy scheme.

“It’s a privilege offered to staff, so when it's abused we can withdraw it. These are internal matters,” said a top source at the airline’s communication office on Tuesday, June 4.

 ,"The whereabouts of thousands of Kenyan students who went abroad to study but later dropped out for various reasons is unknown, the Commission for University Education (CUE) has revealed.

The commission told a parliamentary committee yesterday that it could only give the number of students by gender who had gone to foreign universities, but not what exactly they were doing in those countries.

Following the revelation, lawmakers in the National Assembly expressed concern that the situation could lead to some students being deported or stranded in their host countries.

Appearing before the Committee on Diaspora Affairs and Migrant Workers, the Commission's Standards and Quality Assurance Division, Dr Eunice Marete, and the Commission's Senior Assistant Secretary (Standards, Recognition and Equivalence of Qualifications), Gilbert Opanga, told MPs that data protection in those countries prevented them from knowing exactly what the students were doing.

""We can give the number of students who have gone abroad by gender, we have the data and we are constantly updating it. We can also get the numbers that have gone from the agencies but we cannot get what they are doing because of data protection in those countries,"" Mr Opanga told MPs.

Mr Opanga told MPs that there was need to work with other stakeholders to know what students do after they drop out of their courses.

Read: Finland scandal: How Mandago’s aides moved millions of parents’ money to personal accounts

""We need to tighten the rules so that when they drop out, we know if they have enrolled for another course,"" Mr Opanga said.

He said they would compile data on the numbers by June and present it to the committee.

Mr Opanga told MPs that Australia and Ireland have become the favourites of most Kenyans seeking education in foreign universities.

Dr Marete said only licensed recruitment agencies are allowed to facilitate the enrolment of students in foreign universities.

Thousands of gullible parents and guardians have been duped of millions of shillings by dubious agencies that claim to be able to place them in some of the prestigious universities abroad.

Parents usually fork out millions of shillings to these fraudsters in the hope that their children will fulfil their academic dreams in the foreign universities. However, in most cases this has turned out to be a scam, leaving many parents defrauded but with no recourse as the agencies operate illegally.

When licensing recruitment agencies, the Commission requires them to submit the number of students recruited to each university and country. The data must be broken down by gender.

Agencies are also required to provide the name and level of the programme the students would be studying at the foreign institutions, the type of sponsorship, whether the students are self-sponsored or on scholarship.

If the students are on scholarships, the agencies are expected to provide the name of the organisation.

In order to be licensed by the commission, the agencies must meet other legal requirements set by the national government, such as having a certificate of incorporation, a business licence and a freight certificate.

However, Dr Marete complained that some agencies start operating as soon as they obtain these documents without a licence from the commission.

To curb this, Dr Marete said the commission is currently working with the National Intelligence Service (NIS), Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and county governments to ensure compliance by student recruitment agencies.

Dr Marete also lamented that with the advancement of internet connectivity, some agencies are opting to operate online, making it difficult for the commission to detect them and bring them under the applicable regulatory framework.

""The commission is keen to act on any negative information about agencies that comes from the mainstream media as well as social media,"" Dr Marete told the committee.

The committee is conducting investigations into the legality of recruitment by agencies in the country.

Kenya is currently grappling with the Finland scholarship row, where some families claimed they were duped of millions to recruit their children to study abroad.

From criminals to IT experts: Inside plan to reinvent Mulot,"The government has announced plans to establish an information and communication technology (ICT) hub in Mulot as part of efforts to shed the region’s reputation as East Africa’s cybercrime headquarters.

The devolved administration has secured land for the project to build Kenya’s first rural-based hub of its kind. The multibillion-shilling initiative will be implemented by the Kenyan government in collaboration with global ICT companies. This follows President William Ruto’s directive to the county government to secure land for the ICT hub.

“We want to ensure that the youths in Mulot put their talents to good use instead of engaging in cybercrime,” Dr Ruto said in Bomet town recently.

Illegal activities

For years, Mulot has been notorious for mobile money fraud, with trading centres such as Mulot Central, Mulot Olomirani, and Mulot Sunset becoming hotspots for illegal activities.

The Bomet County Government has secured 52 acres in Mulot Sunset for the ICT hub, said Stella Rotich, the chief officer in charge of ICT in the county.

“Setting up a software development factory will transform Mulot from a cybercrime hub to a centre of innovation and coding training for the youth. It will be a game-changer in the country,” Ms Rotich told the Nation.

She added that, in the interim, an ICT hub will be established on a 4.5-acre plot initially identified for the project, with tendering for the project expected to start in the 2024/2025 financial year.

Governor Hillary Barchok said his administration was working with the State to turn the region’s fortunes around.

“We have succeeded in securing the land and are looking forward to the allocation of funds for construction of the software factory,” Professor Barchok said.

The centre will also train the youth on e-commerce, said Bomet East MP Richard Yegon, adding:“It is important that we rid the area of crime. The software factory will expand Mulot into a major trading centre and create employment for locals.”

SIM swap criminals

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been tracking down SIM swap criminals.

County police boss Robinson Ndiwa told the Nation that the crackdown was starting to bear fruits following the arrest of several suspects.

“The problem we are faced with is the failure by the victims to come forward and prosecute the cases, forcing the courts to release them,” Mr Ndiwa said. In the past six months, more than 25 suspects have been arrested.

A Bomet court recently released five mobile money fraudsters who were arrested with exercise books filled with names of the targeted victims alongside their mobile phone numbers, SIM card pins, M-Pesa balances, Fuliza limits, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) account details and KCB M-Pesa loan limits.

The books had records of names and dates of births of the SIM card holders, their home origins among other crucial details.

Police had also recovered 14 unused SIM cards, nine Safaricom used SIM cards and 11 national identity cards suspected to have been stolen.

The case collapsed after Safaricom and Airtel refused to cooperate with the investigators, according to State prosecutor Clara Boyon, with the Resident Magistrate Mbethi Michuki allowing the prosecution to close the file.

Following the police operation, a majority of the fraudsters have now relocated to Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu, Kajiado, Baringo and Nairobi counties.

Impending raids

The police have in the past been accused of colluding with the criminals by tipping them off about impending raids, thereby facilitating their escape.

Interestingly, most Mulot cybercrime suspects are primary and secondary school dropouts.

They are suspected to work in cahoots with employees from mobile phone companies and banking institutions, some of whom have been sacked over integrity issues.

Cheers to the women who are ‘difficult to love’,"Warsan Shire's poignant poem ""For Women Who Are Difficult to Love"" lyrically celebrates feminine individuality and authenticity.

It’s an ode to that ""terrifying, strange, and beautiful woman who's a horse running alone, and he tries to tame you."" It honours the woman who's ""something not everyone knows how to love.""

If you are a woman who's ever tried to shrink yourself to fit into a man’s (or the world’s) idea of who you should be, then this poem is for you.

If, like the late Prof Wangari Maathai, you have ever been told you are too much of anything, then this poem is for you.

For those unfamiliar with Prof Maathai’s brand of “unlovability,” during her divorce, the Nobel laureate’s ex-husband claimed she was “too educated, too strong, too successful, too stubborn, and too hard to control”.

Read: It’s raining single women

Ms Shire’s poem symbolises women's unshackling from the demands and expectations of a deeply patriarchal society.

There's nothing more intimidating to patriarchy than a woman who is free, confident, outspoken, and self-assured.

A male acquaintance once told me that outspoken women needed to be domesticated — relegated to traditional roles of wife, mother, and homemaker.

I retorted that these women were not wild animals.

In retrospect, there's nothing wrong with being a wild animal in response to patriarchy.

Stella Nyanzi's brand of feminism is particularly wild and free. Ms Nyanzi is a Ugandan human rights advocate, poet, medical anthropologist, feminist, and queer rights advocate who has stripped to get her points across.

Defying patriarchy

Women staying in their stereotypical roles benefit the power structures of a patriarchal society. I celebrate all the women who defy this.

In an episode of the Women Lift Health Global Conference Podcast Series titled Confronting Fears That Silence Women, Speaking Up & Standing Out, two of the boldest media personalities I’ve ever encountered, Lizz Ntonjira and Rachel Ombaka, speak about the fear that holds women back.

It's a fear that, like the one described by Toni Morrison in Jazz about the character Alice, is “Seeded in childhood, watered every day since fear had sprouted through her veins all her life”.

Ms Ombaka and Ms Ntonjira discussed how girls are conditioned to seek approval, conform, and avoid criticism from childhood.

This fear of criticism follows them into boardrooms and sabotages them. They encouraged women to speak up, be bold, and unapologetic about who they are and their achievements.

As for me, I don't want to be a “good African woman”. I'm happy with being “something not everyone knows how to love.” I celebrate women from this tribe. Cheers to every woman who’s “difficult to love.”

Mexico's election of a female president

This article would be incomplete without celebrating Mexico's first female president Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Having read about her background and litany of achievements, I daresay that this woman of many firsts was also “difficult to love”.

 ,"If you look up the meaning of Miss Unconventional in the English dictionary, you will see Asunta Wagura's avatar.

And here’s why. When, in the stigma-ridden 90s, it was unconventional and unheard of to share one's HIV status publicly, Asunta boldly wore the t-shirt with a red-lettered inscription: HIV-POSITIVE.

When doctors gave her six months to live, she put the doggone Grim Reaper on time out and also forced them to repeat math classes. When anticipating her death, they bought her burial dress - years later – she replaced it with a resplendent university graduation gown.

And when she was told that, because of her HIV-positive status, she could not have biological children, she bore Peter Kanyi. Peter is now a 34-year-old man who has flown out of the nest. End of story, right? Wrong. Dead wrong.

Read: Lipodystrophy has disfigured me, but I still sleep soundly

To the surprise of many, Asunta bore Joshua, 17. Chapter closed, right? Nope. In 2010, she gave birth to Israel, 14. Then several years later she, supposedly, closed that chapter with twin boys; Baraka and Gabriel, 11.

""The age-old question that echoes through the living rooms of every family gathering, as if my uterus were up for a public referendum.

In life, most chapters are closed when one breathes their last. But, as long as one has a pulse, the possibilities are wide open. And Asunta proved that when, three months ago, she gave birth to twin girls.

Why, Asunta? I shoot with both smoking barrels out of my hips. Some people may wonder, why more babies?

Public referendum

""Ah, the age-old question that echoes through the living rooms of every family gathering, as if my uterus were up for a public referendum. Well, I'll tell you why — because my retirement plan isn't going to fund itself!,” the mother of seven tells Nation Lifestyle.

I am taken aback. Asunta notices, but decides to keep pulling my leg.

“Think about it: some people invest in eighth-acre plots, or quail eggs, or other get-rich-quick schemes. But me? I invest in children. It's the perfect plan! Each child is like a little NSSF [National Social Security Fund] cheque that walks, talks, and eventually, fingers crossed starts making enough money to keep me in the lifestyle I aspire to in my golden years,” she says.

“You're joking, right?” I blurt.

“Wasoh, pick that jaw on the floor and let's be real!” Asunta laughs. [I'm Wasonga and she calls me Wasoh] “The other reason is simply, why not? I pray to a non-conventional God; a God who has the entire cosmos in His hands. My God doesn't conform to human standards. So why wouldn't I tap into that divine abundance? Initially, my blueprint for life included having up to 10 children. Yeah, I was aiming for my little football team. Which means that, technically, I'm still three short; but hey, this squad I've got now? I can work with this.”

“Seriously, though, each child is a new adventure, a fresh soul to mould in the hope that I'll leave the world a little better than I found it. Children forget their parents when they leave the nest and start their own lives. Each child is another shot at getting at least one child who doesn't forget Mother's Day or mama’s birthday or …,” she says.

“… Or mama's slippers?” I joke.

“Yeah, those too!,” Asunta says.

Trial and ceaseless prayers

Conceiving and carrying a baby to term is not always a straight line. To some people, it is full of sad twists and turns. It is full of anxious moments of waiting and hoping, praying, and overcoming marital and spiritual trials. Because, to many people, a baby is the jewel that crowns life and nuptials.

“Did I try to conceive before these twin girls?” Asunta repeats my question. “You bet! It wasn’t exactly a ‘walk in, walk out’ kind of deal. More like a ‘walk in, trip, and fall flat on my face’ sort of situation!

“Ask that doctor whose practice is located along Nairobi's Ngong’ Road; I'm pretty sure my failed IVF attempts have him cruising around in a Range Rover by now. Who knew fertility treatments could double as a luxury car funding plan? But let me tell you, after numerous tries …” [In vitro fertilisation or IVF is where an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory, then the embryo is returned to the woman's womb to grow].

“How many IVFs?” I interject.

“Enough to consider buying stock in pregnancy tests! After many failed IVF tries, we finally struck gold. It worked, leaving my bank account a bit dented. But all the money in the world can't beat the joy a new baby brings. Despite my savings being almost irreparably dented, I consider myself the richest woman. Not in cash, maybe, but definitely in cuddles, baby giggles and the occasional baptism by baby vomit,” she says.

In Kenya, IVF ranges from Sh370,000 to Sh700,000 depending on the hospital; or if a couple is using a donor egg or donor sperm; or if they are paying for additional costs such as testing if the embryo has inherited diseases or for chromosome analysis.

Different strokes for different folks

I play the devil's advocate. I asked Asunta what she would say to people who say that, instead of putting herself through hell, she could have adopted children.

Read: It is time to wear the red ribbon in our hearts

“Well, I like to think of my approach to family building as the buffet line at brunch; why choose one dish when you can sample a bit of everything? I've got a heart big enough for adoption and biological children alike,” she says.

As the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with AIDS (KENWA), Asunta adopted children infected and affected with HIV. Her adoption modus operandi depended on different situations. For instance, for some children who were ailing from HIV-related complications, Asunta took the approach of round-the-clock primary caregiving. She lived with them children – most of whom were on the verge of death - and nursed them back to life.



Realising that the need was overwhelming and her roof would not be able to handle the need on the ground, Asunta started a children's home. Deep down in her heart, she has been – not just a mother to children – but a mother to folks who have been orphaned and ostracised from society via HIV.

Asunta has always wanted girls. Biological baby girls, to be precise. She has made this fact crystal clear on numerous occasions in the past. How does it feel to finally have biological baby girls?

“I’m not saying I feel like Superman, but I’ve been spotted trying to see if I could leap buildings in a single bound... though it’s more like over piles of laundry and toys these days. In some ways, I feel super powerful. Only my superpower is surviving on three hours of sleep and magically detecting the difference between a hungry cry and a ‘just checking if you’ll come running’ cry.”



About the HIV status of her twin girls, Asunta says she will soon be sharing this, but, so far so good, although they are waiting to do another confirmatory test.

Mother of all multitaskers

Is there anything special Asunta is doing to take care of her baby girls?

“Well, let’s just say I’ve become a master of multitasking; having these many children and just two hands forces any mother to be a multitasker,” Asunta laughs. “Goodness me, I wish I was an octopus! I would juggle all these responsibilities like a pro juggler on America’s Got Talent.”

She has mastered the art of hiding her previous pregnancies. Plus, though her life is an open book, she is not a fan of gender reveals. She is as old school as they come. She prefers to surprise folks – not with a baby bump – but with a baby.

However, this time around, her baby bump almost gave her away. She looked like she was carrying an entire football team. Thank God, they were just two perfectly timed human babies. But, knowing Asunta, she would not mind a football team … plus the subs.

Support system

Every mother needs a support system; whether they are a new mother who has never nursed a baby or they are giving birth for the nth time. Holistic support can go a long way in making the motherhood experience enjoyable and alleviating issues like postpartum depression.

Women who have given birth at an advanced age face side-eye glances.

So how did the 59-year-old mother of seven break the news that she was a new mother? Well, for Asunta, there is no shame in the game. She learnt to deal with shame, stigma and discrimination years ago. This means that this issue was water off a duck's back.

“It was a mixed bag; you don't expect to get 100 percent support,” she says. “Some swung into the supportive camp before I even hung up the phone. Others were scratching their heads, wondering what in the world just happened.”

“As for friends, they were all cheers and surprises. The extended family? Well, we might need to set aside a whole new day for that saga, as red Nyeri dust is still settling. I've been dodging questions like a pro, especially those that tread a bit too close to the twins’ privacy,” she says.

Asunta has never been shy about sharing her life and love; be they dirt or diamonds.

She says that, save for her five boys, there is no man in her life. She is too busy living to wait for life. Besides, she has had enough heartbreaks, and, to quote the lyrics from Nobody's Supposed to Be Here by Debora Cox: “I put my heart under lock-and-key; to take some time and take care of me,” she says.

Balancing game

It is a balancing game in Asunta’s home. It is about balancing responsibilities and love and ensuring nobody feels left out. And this calls for different skills. Unfortunately, such skills are not taught in school; one has to learn them on the job.

“My older twin boys have appointed themselves as professional babysitters. They've got the job down, except when Israel decides his brotherly support is best delivered in the form of serenades from a safe distance. And Joshua? Oh, he handles the babies as if they're made of fine china, always one wobble away from disaster,” she says.

Asunta says she is just here to enjoy the show. She has psyched herself up for the challenges, taking it one day at a time, refusing to let the postpartum fatigue steal the joy of these moments. She knows this [getting another baby] may never happen again, so she is soaking it all in and feeling ridiculously grateful that she somehow 'hacked' the fertility system.

Pursue your dream

If you are thinking about following a similar path—chasing down a dream of expanding your family or any dream—do your research thoroughly. Asunta spent countless hours investigating everything, from potential donors to healthcare options. It took the combined efforts of professionals both in Kenya and her country of residence to pull this off.

“Carrying this pregnancy was like embarking on a top-secret mission where the ultimate goal was to surprise everyone with the news at just the right moment.



You cannot leave anything to chance. Not when it concerns a mother's and a child's life. Though Asunta is as healthy as can be, she still took a tonne of medications, needles and a whole lot of vitamins, minerals and tests for three to four years.

Asunta gave birth through Cesarean section or C-section. The twin girls were born full-term and, hopefully, they are avoiding any neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) drama.

“I am immensely grateful to God, the giver of life, and to all those who played a part in this journey—some of whom I’ve never even seen their faces,” Asunta says. “They’re all beautiful souls, and may they be blessed abundantly in their lives.”

“Carrying this pregnancy was like embarking on a top-secret mission where the ultimate goal was to surprise everyone with the news at just the right moment.”

Why keep it under wraps? I inquire.

“At the delightful approach of the big six-zero [60-year-old], most folks expect you to chat about grandkids or retirement plans; not that you're expanding your family … which, to some, is already done and dusted. There's this mentality out there that puts limits on what's supposedly appropriate for our age, but I say, 'Why not challenge the status quo?'

“If you’ve got a dream, whether it’s baby-related or not, pursue it! Just remember to arm yourself with knowledge, a good support network, and maybe a sense of humour. Trust me, you’re going to need a funny bone,” she says.

Teaser

I asked Asunta the 90-year-old question: Has she finally closed the chapter? Or, like Sarah in the Bible, will she surprise us with baby news at 90 years old?

Beautiful chaos

“For now, let’s just say I'm enjoying the current beautiful chaos,” Asunta says, with a mischievous smile. “After all, in Kikuyu, we say, ‘Mũtumia mutuīre’; a woman is strong … and I’m just living up to that!”

“Well, considering I’ve already thrown a surprise party with this pregnancy, who knows? I might still have a trick or two up my sleeve. Oops! Me and my big mouth.”

There has been talk in town that Asunta is not living with HIV and that she never birthed her children.

""From the time I outlived my set time for death, people have been saying many things. Any person living with HIV, such as the late Joe Muriuki, was accused of the same thing; that we were not HIV-positive, that we were doing it for the money. If people knew what my son, Peter, and I were put through—the stigma, discrimination, and anguish - if they would walk in our shoes, then, they would not spew such lies. But I'm used to it,"" she says.

""About my children, I'm not the type of person who shares her pregnancy journey. I prefer to keep such experiences private. I have had miscarriages. These, too, people never knew about. These are my children. They are the fruits of my womb,"" she tells Nation Lifestyle.

 ,"Members of Parliament on Tuesday, June 4 made Higher Education and Research Principal Secretary Beatrice Inyangala commit to withdraw admission letters of students expected to join university until the exact amount the learners are to pay as fee is established.

More than 19,572 students did not take up their chances at university last year despite having been placed, in what lawmakers attribute to “inefficiency” of the new higher education financing model.

The opposition Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition has called for the scrapping of the funding system, saying it favours students from wealthy backgrounds.

National Assembly Committee on Education Chairman, Julius Melly, yesterday said his team has visited public universities and established that 10 to 15 per cent of students placed failed report.

Last year, some 130,485 students were placed to the institutions by the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (Kuccps). The number this year is 134,743.

“This committee went round and received complaints from universities, students and parents about the funding model,” Mr Melly said during a sitting with the PS, Kuccps Chief Executive Agnes Mercy Wahome, Universities Fund (UF) boss Geoffrey Monari and Higher Education Loans Board chief Charles Ringera.

“Some parents were shocked to see the fee structure and asked their children to choose something else.”

Mr Ringera said funding agencies are owed Sh29 billion for support to students in the current financial year that comes to an end in three weeks.

Under the model, a student applies for scholarship and loan after receiving an admission letter from the university she or he has been placed.

The 2023 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination candidates expected to join university in August and September got admission letters following the announcement of placement results last month.

The letters indicate the total cost of the programmes without indicating the amount students will get in form scholarships or loans. The annual tuition fee for degree courses ranges from Sh144,000 to Sh760,000.

Other expenses like accommodation and upkeep are not included.

The Daily Nation reported yesterday that learners are being forced by circumstances to choose courses they can afford rather than what they qualified for.

Some students who qualify for degree courses opt for diploma instead.

Mr Monari told the committee that 9,726 students lodged appeals against their categorisation last year.

Of these, 4,087 were moved to higher bands after providing new information.

There has been no follow-up on whether the unsuccessful 5,639 learners joined the courses they had been placed by Kuccps.

He added that more than 28,000 students did not seek funding from his agency.

Kabondo Kasipul MP, Eve Akinyi Obara, said university administrators told the committee during the visits that the Means Testing Instrument (MTI) used to categorise students is not effective.

“The MTI isn’t watertight. Get data from the universities on students who have dropped out and effect affirmative action immediately,” she said.

The MPs questioned the information used to classify students. The MTI uses information collected from the Kenya Revenue Authority, the National Hospital Insurance Fund, Kuccps, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, telcos, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, the National Employment Authority, Elimu Scholarship, the National Transport Safety Authority, the National Education Management Information System and the Integrated Population Registration Database.

However, the committee said many students deserving government support have been left out.

“The variables aren’t working. Your figures aren’t adding up and you are relying on wrong information. We don’t want to put our country on a lie,” Mr Melly said, sentiments echoed by Kibra MP Peter Orero.

Kuccps will open the system for inter-university and inter-programme transfers this morning.

Dr Wahome said a student placed at a private university but wishes to be at public institutions can apply for change at no cost.

She added that 18,558 students have been placed to private universities. This is double the 9,622 learners who were placed by Kuccps in 2023.

Kitutu Masaba MP, Clive Gisairo, suggested that the application for courses be linked to the application for funding so that fee structures only indicate household contributions.

The funding model categorises applicants into five bands.

Band One comprises students from households whose monthly income is below Sh5,995.

Those in Band Two come from families with monthly income of Sh5,995 to Sh23,670 while those from households earning Sh23,671 to Sh70,000 are in Band Three.

Band Four comprises students from households of Sh70,001 and Sh119,999 monthly income while those earning Sh120,000 are in Band Five.

In an interview with the Daily Nation in Mombasa, National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi said the government needs to ensure and promote equity and equality in funding university and college students.

“The policy on education has crumbled and doesn’t make sense. Unless you can put in place proper mechanisms to adequately fund education, you have failed as a government. The funding model has only succeeded in making things worse,” the Ugunja MP said.

“We have not seen positive results because the system was rushed. Students and their parents are finding it difficult to access money.”

He said opposition MPs are outnumbered in the National Assembly and could therefore not undo the model.

“We continue to voice these concerns and express ourselves robustly. We hope reason shall prevail and the government will see the sense to do what is right,” Mr Wandayi said.

"Dear CS Namwamba, as you celebrate the wins, truly fix Kenyan sports","If you read through the X handle of Cabinet Secretary for Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports, Ababu Namwamba, you would be forgiven for thinking Kenyan sports is flourishing.

The able, “Super CS"" who delivers, paints a picture of a utopian Kenyan sports world where glorious success is the order of the day, and all historical problems are astutely being handled.

Read him this year:

On an inspection visit of Talanta Sports City that is under construction:

“Talanta Sports City. Today, Saturday 25.05.2024. 86 days from ground-breaking. Coming along nicely, on track, on schedule. Deliberately, steadily, assuredly, we are fixing decades of neglect that has compromised status of Kenya's sports and creatives infrastructure. Confident.”

Another one on the renovation of our stadiums:

“Perfectly on course with the most significant and consequential stadium upgrade in Kenya's history. Temporary inconvenience, Permanent solution to decades of neglect. #TalantaHela”.

On Kenya’s Fifa World Cup quest:

“Harambee Stars coach Firat praises Sports CS Namwamba’s transformative zeal.”

On the government’s pet sports project, Talanta Hela:

“Every blade of grass, every grain of sand. Wherever a special talent is in Whatever corner of our Republic, we shall identify, nurture and monetise it. #TalantaHela.”

Then his cathartic, fawning congratulatory messages to Kenyan national teams that have registered victory on the international arena.

In athletics: “Congratulations #TeamKenya for this thrilling triumph at the 2024 World Cross Country Championship in Belgrade, Serbia. You have conquered the whole world, once again, bringing pride to our nation. HONGERA!”

In women’s football: “Hongera #JuniorStarlets for beating Ethiopia 3-0 today to qualify for the 4th and final round in the qualifiers for the FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup 2024 that is scheduled for the Dominican Republic in October. You, our superb girls, have made Kenya proud. Now we knuckle up for Burundi. Two more games to history.”

In rugby: “Hongera lads. You are our Madaraka Day #Shujaa for returning Kenya to the World Rugby 7s High Table!”

Inspirational leadership

But are things really this good to make our CS go gaga on X not unlike the Kenya Corner at a world SVNS arena?

Scratch the surface, and you find, while there may be some good stories, Kenyan sports is generally hurting and struggling, bereft of sponsorship, short on inspirational leadership, and lacking sound management.

For starters, how can a country of over 50 million that prides itself in being a sports powerhouse close down all its ""international-class"" stadiums amidst a heavy international calendar?

Athletes are crying. Footballers have fled to Malawi to host Kenya’s international matches.

I almost shed a tear for our boxing. For the first time since 1964 Kenya will not have a single fighter at the Olympic Games after all members of the once famous and feared “Hit Squad” failed to secure a Paris ticket.

Cricket is seemingly forgotten. Imagine, a record 20 teams are in the United States and West Indies for the Twenty20 World Cup, including Uganda.

Kenya, once a giant of the game and one-time World Cup ODI semi-finalists, did not even threaten to qualify.

As a former rugby player, it is disheartening to write that Kenya Under-20 rugby side Chipu, are struggling with preparations to represent the country in July’s World Rugby Under-20 Trophy in Scotland.

Perpetual crisis

The less spoken about football the better.

I just wonder what the CS’s end game was in reversing a decision by the same, same government to disband the FKF following recommendations of a ministry-constituted probe committee that found serious legal and managerial problems within the federation.

The upshot is that there are numerous court cases concerning football with the administration of the game at the precipice of a legal quagmire.

Did returning to the international football community solve Kenya’s underlying football problems? No.

The federation has lost almost all goodwill and no sponsor wants to touch them, even with a 10-foot pole.

Clubs are literally on their deathbeds, barely surviving. Small wonder struggling players and officials are being implicated in match-fixing

These same clubs are poorly managed and in perpetual crisis.

What happened to the CAF Club Licensing regulations that were meant to prevent our clubs from being run like roadside kiosks?

Good governance

Why has the sports ministry not been active in helping clubs across all sports disciplines to become more professional in their operations?

Why has the government balked at strictly enforcing the Sports Act? Is the Sports Fund being used optimally?

What a contrast with government actions in the West that we, ironically, aspire to emulate.

Just to pick a couple. The Spanish government on April 25 formed a special committee to oversee the country's football federation pending fresh elections

Spain’s National Sports Council explained the action was ""in response to the crisis in the organisation and in defence of the general interest of Spain.""

Last week the Italian government appointed a cabinet-approved committee of experts to oversee the finances of professional sports clubs.

The committee will supervise ""the legality and regularity of the economic and financial management of professional sports clubs"" in sports such as football and basketball, to ensure they are properly managed and sustainable.

The British government is planning via an Act of Parliament to establish an independent football regulator to oversee the sport and encourage financial stability.

What is the Kenyan government doing to encourage good governance and financial viability of sports entities in Kenya? What say you, Super CS?

"Anatomy of a sick nation: Patients suffer amid drug, vaccine shortage in hospitals","The country’s public hospitals are facing a severe shortage of essential drugs and vaccines, leaving critically ill patients without access to life-saving treatment.

Some of the most affected are HIV prophylaxis for children, painkillers, antibiotics, antidepressants, anticancers as well as antidiabetic drugs.

Also lacking are medicines needed in the performance of life-saving surgical procedures, such as anaesthesia.

The Nation has also learnt that the country has no syringes to administer vaccines.

The shortage exposes a deeper problem within the country’s healthcare system — inadequate financing, irregular and delayed release of funds for drug procurement and significant debts owed to international health organisations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).

This has led to empty shelves in hospital pharmacies and rising despair among patients who rely on these drugs for survival.

Read: Alarm as public hospitals run short of common drugs

It is not known when supply will be revamped, but Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha told the Nation that the shortage had been resolved, with some of the drugs already in the country and others expected next week.

Ms Nakhumicha explained that the challenges facing Kenya’s healthcare system are a reflection of the country’s health supply chain being broken and vendor-driven.

“A responsive supply chain is based on needs and once the needs are established, then data-driven quantification and forecasting is done to determine quantities for procurement. This is why I am focused on reforms. It’s not going to be easy to change, but I am determined,” she said.

Out of stock

Ms Nakhumicha also denied that nevirapine and zidovudine drugs were out of reach for many HIV-positive mothers with newborns.

“Those saying we are out of stock should check with the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (Nascop) on service and commodity security for HIV,” she stated.

“The country’s stocks of nevirapine cover 15 months while those of zidovudine cover 14 months,” the Health CS told the Nation, adding that global best practice expects them to have a minimum stock cover of at least nine months.

A spot check in hospitals and interviews with patients, however, indicated that there are no drugs in many public hospitals.

The Nation met 26-year-old *Joy Njeri, a newborn mum, outside Thika District Hospital in Gatundu South, Kiambu County, where she had camped from morning in search of paediatric HIV drugs.

It was her third day at the hospital.

Read: Mothers we lost inside maternity wards

Ms Njeri, who disclosed to the Nation that she was born with HIV, was at the hospital for drugs for her two-week-old baby.

“I am here because the doctors told me that they had run out of nevirapine and zidovudine, which are usually given as prophylaxis to a baby exposed to the deadly virus at birth so that they do not contract the disease through breast milk,” she said.

“I don’t want my baby to get HIV. I have been coming to the hospital with the hope that the vital medication will be made available. I was told to keep checking and that the hospital was inquiring from other hospitals if they had supplies.”

The same drug is missing in Kibra. Ms Zipporah Achieng’, a community health promoter and HIV warrior born with the virus, said she has been approached by parents who have run out of the drug.

HIV-positive

“They come to me because I am open about my HIV-positive status and have a three-year-old child who is HIV-negative. They want the same for their babies but unfortunately, the drugs that my baby was put on are out of reach for them.”

She disclosed that the situation is dire in Kibra with mothers who were lucky to get the sought-after drugs a few months ago sharing their doses with recent newborn mothers and putting their own babies in danger.

Ms Achieng’ is concerned that the country could be ‘silently breeding’ a new generation of HIV-positive children because the government has not made the drugs available.

As the hospitals report a shortage of critical drugs that are on the country’s essential list, a number are also recording shortages of children’s vaccines.

Many children being born now are going without the vaccines hence putting their lives at risk of contracting deadly diseases in future.

“There are also no doses of childhood vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). My baby has not received any jab. I am concerned about where I can get the vaccine. I have been to many health facilities in Kibra and Mathare,” Ms Lucy Atieno from Dagoretti revealed.

The shortage will see at least 1.6 million infants, a similar number of pregnant women as well as 750,000 girls under the age of 10 who need the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, fail to get them.

About 15,000 fewer children were vaccinated in April when the country started recording the shortages, but the number could be higher since the issue has not been resolved.

The HPV vaccine is given to girls under 10, who number about 750,000 every year. The remaining stock in some hospitals may not last a month.

A Ministry of Health insider told the Nation that the government has up to July 1 to clear a Sh1.5 billion debt for the last financial year to Unicef and Gavi so that Gavi can release their co-financing portion of Sh8 billion for this financial year.

Kenya, too, has to put Sh3.6 billion of its own into the scheme. This is because Kenya must submit its 20 per cent contribution to Gavi before the organisation releases its 80 per cent funding.

This is to put the country on a trajectory of self-sustainability and prepare it for the phasing out of Gavi backing.

“Last week, the government paid Sh1.25 billion to the international organisation and this opened the door for emergency procurement. The government has since requested Unicef to expedite delivery. We are expecting the first batch next week. But should the government fail to pay the Sh1.5 billion, then Gavi will withdraw its support, including equipment,” said the official.

According to documents seen by the Nation, Kenya has not procured the DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis) vaccine for 10 months, with public hospitals reporting shortages.

The BCG vaccine, given at birth to prevent tuberculosis, has not been procured for eight months.

Already, TB, polio, measles, rubella, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rotavirus, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), measles-rubella (MR), human papillomavirus (HPV), yellow fever vaccine and malaria vaccines are out of stock.

It is recommended that a country has at least eight months’ stock of every vaccine in its supply chain.

Kenya’s current stocks of these vaccines may be exhausted in two months. This year, the government reduced the budget for vaccines from Sh2.6 billion to Sh1.2 billion, leading to unpaid bills and a shortage of Gavi-supplied vaccines.

Last week, a spot check by Nation in public health facilities around the country established that over 27 counties had run out of stock and were in dire need of key drugs and medicines on Kenya’s Essential Medicines List.

In an exclusive interview in the same week, Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) CEO Dr Andrew Mulwa disclosed that the authority was operating from hand to mouth given that as of May 29, all 47 counties owed it a total of Sh3 billion.

Kemsa gets 90 per cent of its business from counties and supplies drugs and medical equipment, giving counties a 45-day credit period.



“We are stocked up to 70 per cent,” Dr Mulwa said.

Therapeutic foods

He said that ready-to-use therapeutic foods, TB, HIV, malaria, Covid-19, cancer, blood transfusion as well as family planning/reproductive products are the most affected.

Kemsa also procures medical supplies on behalf of the health and development partners, this is then followed up with a distribution list for delivery to various targeted populations across the country.

Council of Governors Health committee chair Muthomi Njuki, however, told Nation that the allegations that counties owe Kemsa a lot of money hence affecting the delivery of drugs is a fresh plot to return the health function to the national government through a calculated smear campaign painting the devolved units as inept.

“As it stands now, counties have not received their equitable share from the national government for three months, including June, yet, the IFMIS system reportedly slowed down from mid-June, this is why we as governors cannot pay Kemsa the Sh3billion we owe them,” the Tharaka Nithi governor said.

He accused the national government of denying counties their equitable share of about Sh100 billion, adding that had the national government stuck to the law and disbursed resources on the 15th of every month, no county would be having a debt at Kemsa.

“A debt is not bad. The agreement we have with Kemsa gives counties a repayment grace period. Counties would not hesitate to clear debts owed if they receive money from Treasury,” Mr Muthomi said.

“The national government should also prioritise settling the Sh2billion pledge to Kemsa,” he added

"Dear CS Namwamba, as you celebrate the wins, truly fix Kenyan sports","If you read through the X handle of Cabinet Secretary for Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports, Ababu Namwamba, you would be forgiven for thinking Kenyan sports is flourishing.

The able, “Super CS"" who delivers, paints a picture of a utopian Kenyan sports world where glorious success is the order of the day, and all historical problems are astutely being handled.

Read him this year:

On an inspection visit of Talanta Sports City that is under construction:

“Talanta Sports City. Today, Saturday 25.05.2024. 86 days from ground-breaking. Coming along nicely, on track, on schedule. Deliberately, steadily, assuredly, we are fixing decades of neglect that has compromised status of Kenya's sports and creatives infrastructure. Confident.”

Another one on the renovation of our stadiums:

“Perfectly on course with the most significant and consequential stadium upgrade in Kenya's history. Temporary inconvenience, Permanent solution to decades of neglect. #TalantaHela”.

On Kenya’s Fifa World Cup quest:

“Harambee Stars coach Firat praises Sports CS Namwamba’s transformative zeal.”

On the government’s pet sports project, Talanta Hela:

“Every blade of grass, every grain of sand. Wherever a special talent is in Whatever corner of our Republic, we shall identify, nurture and monetise it. #TalantaHela.”

Then his cathartic, fawning congratulatory messages to Kenyan national teams that have registered victory on the international arena.

In athletics: “Congratulations #TeamKenya for this thrilling triumph at the 2024 World Cross Country Championship in Belgrade, Serbia. You have conquered the whole world, once again, bringing pride to our nation. HONGERA!”

In women’s football: “Hongera #JuniorStarlets for beating Ethiopia 3-0 today to qualify for the 4th and final round in the qualifiers for the FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup 2024 that is scheduled for the Dominican Republic in October. You, our superb girls, have made Kenya proud. Now we knuckle up for Burundi. Two more games to history.”

In rugby: “Hongera lads. You are our Madaraka Day #Shujaa for returning Kenya to the World Rugby 7s High Table!”

Inspirational leadership

But are things really this good to make our CS go gaga on X not unlike the Kenya Corner at a world SVNS arena?

Scratch the surface, and you find, while there may be some good stories, Kenyan sports is generally hurting and struggling, bereft of sponsorship, short on inspirational leadership, and lacking sound management.

For starters, how can a country of over 50 million that prides itself in being a sports powerhouse close down all its ""international-class"" stadiums amidst a heavy international calendar?

Athletes are crying. Footballers have fled to Malawi to host Kenya’s international matches.

I almost shed a tear for our boxing. For the first time since 1964 Kenya will not have a single fighter at the Olympic Games after all members of the once famous and feared “Hit Squad” failed to secure a Paris ticket.

Cricket is seemingly forgotten. Imagine, a record 20 teams are in the United States and West Indies for the Twenty20 World Cup, including Uganda.

Kenya, once a giant of the game and one-time World Cup ODI semi-finalists, did not even threaten to qualify.

As a former rugby player, it is disheartening to write that Kenya Under-20 rugby side Chipu, are struggling with preparations to represent the country in July’s World Rugby Under-20 Trophy in Scotland.

Perpetual crisis

The less spoken about football the better.

I just wonder what the CS’s end game was in reversing a decision by the same, same government to disband the FKF following recommendations of a ministry-constituted probe committee that found serious legal and managerial problems within the federation.

The upshot is that there are numerous court cases concerning football with the administration of the game at the precipice of a legal quagmire.

Did returning to the international football community solve Kenya’s underlying football problems? No.

The federation has lost almost all goodwill and no sponsor wants to touch them, even with a 10-foot pole.

Clubs are literally on their deathbeds, barely surviving. Small wonder struggling players and officials are being implicated in match-fixing

These same clubs are poorly managed and in perpetual crisis.

What happened to the CAF Club Licensing regulations that were meant to prevent our clubs from being run like roadside kiosks?

Good governance

Why has the sports ministry not been active in helping clubs across all sports disciplines to become more professional in their operations?

Why has the government balked at strictly enforcing the Sports Act? Is the Sports Fund being used optimally?

What a contrast with government actions in the West that we, ironically, aspire to emulate.

Just to pick a couple. The Spanish government on April 25 formed a special committee to oversee the country's football federation pending fresh elections

Spain’s National Sports Council explained the action was ""in response to the crisis in the organisation and in defence of the general interest of Spain.""

Last week the Italian government appointed a cabinet-approved committee of experts to oversee the finances of professional sports clubs.

The committee will supervise ""the legality and regularity of the economic and financial management of professional sports clubs"" in sports such as football and basketball, to ensure they are properly managed and sustainable.

The British government is planning via an Act of Parliament to establish an independent football regulator to oversee the sport and encourage financial stability.

What is the Kenyan government doing to encourage good governance and financial viability of sports entities in Kenya? What say you, Super CS?

Kemri and CDC join hands to combat influenza,"The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are working on enhancing laboratory quality measures for influenza, biosafety and other respiratory viruses in the country.

Speaking during a capacity building workshop facilitated by CDC, Dr Festus Tolo, who represented Kemri acting Director General Elijah Songok, highlighted the crucial role that laboratory science plays in the global health landscape, particularly in the context of infectious diseases like Influenza.

In March, the Health ministry confirmed that there was an influenza outbreak in the country. The ministry’s acting Director General Patrick Amoth  disputed reports of a spike in Covid-19 cases caused by a new variant after claims by doctors  that  they were seeing patients they suspected had the JN1 Covid-19 variant.

Dr Amoth, who noted that  “the government has been looking for the JNI variant since December but no case has been reported in the country”,  disclosed that the increased number of people who were experiencing coughs and sore throat was as a result of  seasonal flu.

“None of these sites have reported an increase in the numbers of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19), but increased cases of influenza have been reported,” he said, adding that Kenya reports an upsurge in two peaks — February to March and July to November.

“The current increase in numbers is in line with the expected cases of influenza at this time of the year and there has been no significant changes in the number of hospitalisations and deaths reported,” Dr Amoth explained.

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine observes that influenza-associated respiratory illness was substantial during the emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic in Kenya.  However, recent national estimates of influenza burden in the post-pandemic period are unavailable to guide influenza vaccine policy .

Speaking during the workshop at Kemri, CDC Influenza Programme Director Gideon Emukule,  who welcomed at least 15 participants drawn from Togo, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Zanzibar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Kenya, said much more needs to be done to combat influenza in the country and the entire region.

Training and investing in experts was highlighted as a key pillar of dealing with influenza, which is why key expertise was pooled from Kenya’s National Influenza Center that is routinely involved in handling and testing specimens for various respiratory pathogens.

“Substantial efforts are ongoing worldwide to combat influenza and other respiratory viruses, this is why we have to build the capacity of laboratory professionals,” Dr Tolo said.

He noted that more funds are needed.

“With the funding and technical support from the US CDC, Kenya has been conducting surveillance for influenza and other respiratory pathogens since 2006. This support has been instrumental in carrying out research here at Kemri,” he said.

Dr Emukule provided in-depth insights into the latest advancements in influenza surveillance and laboratory practices.

“Respiratory pathogens such as influenza, SARSCoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus and others continue to pose a global public health threat and are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality burden globally. I strongly believe that this workshop has equipped you with an advanced understanding of laboratory science, microbiology/virology and Biosafety measures in laboratories.”

The workshop concluded with a call to action for continued commitment to improving laboratory standards and fostering international cooperation.

“ The collaborative efforts of the Kemri-CDC and the participating countries are expected to yield substantial benefits in the ongoing fight against influenza and other respiratory viruses,”Dr Tolo assured.

Floods aftermath: Informal women workers’ saving power diminished,"For 11 years, Mama Yusra (as she prefers to be identified), reported to her workplace every day from 6am.

Her place of work was a small temporary iron-sheet shed over an open trench in the Makina area of Kibera slums, Nairobi County. From here, she sold boiled eggs and French fries.

As a single-parent raising four children, she knew that saving was the only way she would successfully educate her children.

“I want my children to live a better life than mine. All I do, I do for them,” she says.

Read: Death and destruction as floods ravage the country

With that in mind, every week,she would put aside Sh300 from the profits earned from selling boiled eggs in a savings group of 50 women working in the informal economy.

These women do domestic work for pay, sell fast-food like Mama Yusra, trade in second-hand clothes or grocery. None of them has insurance to cover them in case of an emergency, Mama Yusra says.

She made more profits from the French fries. From the business, she saved another Sh500 every week in a merry-go-round of 10 women and every two months, she would receive her accumulated share to pay her children’s school fees.

“In the group where we save Sh 300 weekly, we get all our savings in December.  That is the time I do shopping for my children. I buy them uniforms, books, new clothes and shoes. They also feel happy to have new things. I want them to be happy that they cannot be tempted to seek happiness elsewhere,” she says.

She has three girls and one boy.

Then last April became a doom’s month for her and her household. The raging floods from the heavy rains washed away her shed. It also soaked up her household items, which need repair or replacement.

“If I use the little money I have to repair the shed, then my children will go hungry,” she says.

“I have been out of work since late April and that means I have lost many days of savings. If I remain out of work until December, then for sure, my children will be out of school and they will suffer, since I’ll have little savings in the annual savings group.”

Read: Audit exposes state’s lack of readiness to tackle floods

For women in the informal economy who depend on their irregular daily income to save, disasters such as floods greatly hurt their income flow.

And without insurance to cover the losses and help them recover, their livelihoods are highly unstable and the probability of falling into extreme poverty is particularly certain.

Mama Yusra is not the only one at risk of sinking into absolute poverty. In Kenya, women account for  more than 50 per cent of the 22.3 million working population, and 15 million Kenyans work in the informal economy where Mama Yusra falls.

There are ways of helping them get back on their feet and build their resilience to future climatic shocks. “These floods are reminders of how important it is to offer women in the informal economy social protection,” argues Grace Ananda, Africa policy and advocacy manager at Habitat for Humanity.

Social protection is a set of interventions whose objective is to reduce social and economic risk and vulnerability, and to alleviate extreme poverty and deprivation, explains the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.

These can be in the form of social assistance, which is publicly provided conditional or unconditional cash or in-kind transfers, or public works programmes.

It can also be in the form of  social insurance done as contributory programmes that cover designated contingencies affecting the welfare or income of households.

Governments can also introduce labour market protection such as providing unemployment benefits, building skills and training workers.

For now, Mama Yusra’s focus is to rebuild her business.

“My desire is to move to a better place. Not sell over an open trench. What if it rains again? Will I keep on counting losses?” she wonders.

“I'm, however, hopeful of reopening my business. But I wish the government would be more responsive and give the women whose businesses were affected unconditional grants to recover their businesses.”

 ,"It is a good thing that the Finance and Budget Committee of the Senate has shone the spotlight on allegations of financial improprieties at the Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority (Ufaa).

The fund’s CEO, John Mwangi, and board chairman Francis Kigo were on Tuesday grilled by the senators over alleged misappropriation of Sh10 billion in unclaimed assets. Huge discrepancies in the numbers and data disclosed by holding companies, insurance companies, pension funds and NSE-listed entities and records kept by Ufaa were also alleged.

Parliament must go to the bottom of these allegations because at stake here are the interests of poor widows and orphans who desire and deserve to be reunited with their assets sitting idle in Ufaa books.

Yet the veracity or not of the graft allegations being interrogated by Parliament aside, big policy and legal questions arise. I suggest to the legislators to repeal some sections of the law introduced by then-Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani through the Finance Bill, 2022.

I refer to the amendments that waived penalties to insurance companies, pension funds, commercial banks, bourse-listed firms and other entities that delay or refuse to remit unclaimed assets to Ufaa. Mr Yatani’s amendment amounted to repealing the entire law because the whole purpose of the interest and penalties was to impose punitive fines for non-compliance.

Interest and penalties

By waiving interest and penalties on unremitted unclaimed financial assets, Yatani effectively eliminated the only lever that supports enforcement and compliance of the law, which cannot be voluntary.

Secondly, as Ufaa approaches 10 years of existence, there’s a strong case for reviewing the law on how and where the billions that sit in its account are invested and managed. There is a need for a review of its investment mandate and guidelines.

First, there seems to be a good case for separation of regulation from asset management. You remove conflict of interest, as happened when the Deposit Protection Fund Board was removed from the grip of the Central Bank of Kenya. Secondly, there is a very strong case for bringing Ufaa into the ambit of full compliance with the Retirement Benefits Authority regulations.

Ufaa will then be forced to appoint independent fund managers and custodians. We will no longer hear about how Ufaa has spent Sh500 million on engaging auditors. Even the largest companies in this country do not spend that kind of money on audit services.

Strong case

Thirdly, there is a strong case, indeed, for decentralising the operations of Ufaa. Most of the orphans and widows who should be reunited with their money live in the rural areas. Bringing the fund under RBA regulations will help to insulate it further from corrupt elites’ games and shenanigans.

The fund sits on a whopping Sh63 billion. If you don’t insulate that from the ‘eating chiefs’, the political elite will come up with tricks of spending the money on political projects.

The potential for growth in the fund is huge. A baseline survey commissioned by the authority revealed that, as of October 2018, the number of accounts holding unclaimed financial assets in various institutions in the country was 477,000.

The crafters of the original framework rightly provided that the money could only be invested in Treasury Bills.

It was the right decision. Had that not happened, the political elite would have turned it into another source of largesse, where they can draw funds willy-nilly to finance ill-conceived grand projects that only serve to create opportunities for kick-backs and back-handers for the corrupt.

Politically connected

Had they left everything to the discretion of the politically appointed boards, we would, by now, be seeing a new multi-storey corporate headquarters built by the fund. We would also be hearing how the fund was negotiating to buy a quarry somewhere from some politically connected individual or other.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the National Treasury, under Yatani, invited suggestions on how to loosen the rules restricting investment to Treasury Bills and bring other asset classes into the picture.

This column opposed the idea, arguing that the proposed changes to the law and framework were bound to introduce loopholes which rent-seeking elites would be just too ready and eager to exploit.

Going forward, let’s discuss whether to follow and adopt the international best practice where the regulator’s role is restricted licensing service providers.

It seems that, sooner or later, and as the number of claimants continue to increase, the queues will just be too long for Ufaa to handle. We will need to evolve a network of service providers giving a range of advisory services to members of the public.

Lastly, we should consider expanding Ufaa’s scope to beyond recovering unclaimed financial assets, such as handling property as well.

Let leaders heed public cry on proposed taxes,"Various associations and lobbies appearing at the public participation forums on the Finance Bill, 2024 have made it clear that there is something terribly wrong with proposed taxes.

But even before these professional groups raised their objections, there was already an outcry. For instance, this increasingly unpopular Bill includes a proposal to slap a 16 per cent Valued Added Tax (VAT) on bread, which is a common breakfast item for all Kenyans irrespective of their social status.

A few lawmakers on the government side have got into trouble for trying to explain the rationale behind the taxes. One even claimed that the bread tax was inspired by a concern about the high incidence of diabetes. This is quite pedestrian.

Insurers have warned that VAT on insurance services and motor vehicle tax could spell doom for the industry. They, therefore, called on MPs to shoot down the tax proposals in Parliament, warning that they could result in massive job losses. The Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI) says of the over three million registered cars only half are insured, mostly on third-party cover. Charging VAT on insurance, AKI warned, will hit low-income earners and small-scale businesses hard.

The Bill seeks to raise Sh58 billion from the motor vehicle tax to partly finance the Sh3.9 trillion Budget. But AKI fears the tax will reduce the demand for comprehensive cover and uptake of insurance in general.

A trade lobby has urged MPs to slash the proposed motor vehicle tax from 2.5 per cent of the value to one per cent. The Bill proposes tax of between Sh5,000 and Sh100,000 per year. The Air Transport Association (IATA) has also warned that VAT on aeroplanes will hike domestic and international travel costs.

Transport cost is a major determinant of commodity prices. High taxes on vehicles, on top of insurance premiums, will make transportation costlier, with the ultimate effect being more expensive consumer goods. The public appeal on the tax proposals should not be ignored.

Thai rice imports: Kebs to scrutinise new deliveries,"The government has said it will assess all rice imports to ensure only grain that meets acceptable standards is allowed into the country.

However, the Kenya National Bureau of Standards (Kebs) has said there is no indication that bad rice has entered the country.

Further, Kebs said it will continue laboratory scrutiny of all impending imports.

“No import will be allowed into the country unless it complies with the requirements of relevant Kenyan standards,” Kebs said in a statement on Tuesday.

Kebs was reacting to reports that Thailand is preparing to export 10-year-old grain to Africa.

“We have therefore alerted our appointed inspection agent in Thailand (SGS) of the impending government rice auction and instructed them to be on the lookout and subject all rice destined to Kenya from Thailand to mandatory inspection and testing,” Kebs said.

Last month, African diplomats raised concerns with Bangkok after Thai authorities announced a planned auction of rice that had been stored for 10 years ostensibly to recoup storage costs.

According to local officials, Thailand plans to auction this week some 15,000 tons of rice and export it to Africa, targeting up to $7.4 million in revenues from sales.

The grain is a remnant of a failed rice pledging programme by then Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra who encouraged farmers to grow more grain and supply it to the government at a predetermined price.

The scheme failed after Thai rice became uncompetitive and authorities estimated to have lost up to $13 billion in a scandal that forced Yingluck to flee the country and change nationality.

The officials did not indicate which countries the grain was headed to. However, several African countries, including Kenya, consume some of its white rice.

Thai rice is also consumed in South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Mozambique, and Côte d'Ivoire.

According to the Thai Rice Exporters Association, Thailand sold some 4.6 million tonnes to Africa.

“We became concerned because we don’t know the quality of that rice, which has been in the stores for 10 years. We don’t know the health status of that rice. We have not seen it ourselves. So we started to have some fears that somebody wants to sell bad rice to us,” said Lindsay Kiptiness, Kenya’s Ambassador to Thailand and the Dean of the African Diplomatic Corps in Bangkok.

“Why not to other parts of the world? The world is made up of six continents. Why Africa? We have a duty to protect the health of our people. It is not bad to consume old rice if it has been kept well. Old rice is not bad, but there is a danger that it can have aflatoxins,” he said.

Kebs said the age of the rice is not an issue as long as it meets certain standards.

Usually, the regulator uses three kinds of standadisation for milled rice (KS EAS 128: 2023), (Rough/ paddy rice- Specification and Brown Rice- Specification (KS EAS 764 and KS EAS 765) which are enforced by both countries of origin and destination ports of entry inspectors.

These standards do not prescribe shelf life for rice but Kebs says exporters must indicate the crop year, packing date as well as best-before-date.

They must also indicate the level of aflatoxin or heavy metals presence to confirm the suitability of rice for human consumption since physico-chemical properties do not significantly change if the rice is properly stored.

Sakaja lifts suspension on approvals of building plans,"Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has lifted the order he issued during the recent heavy rains suspending all approvals of architectural plans in Nairobi.

As a result construction work and the approvals of building plans and excavations at construction sites will resume.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Office of the Governor said professionals and representatives of stakeholders in the city would now have a say in the approval of building plans.

“Arising from this, the Nairobi City County Government (NCCG), through the acting County Secretary’s office, has written to various stakeholders requesting them to forward names of professionals and representatives who will now form part of the task force. The task force shall convene on the 12th of June to commence the audit exercise across the city,” the statement reads in part.

Such groups have been asked to complete their work and submit a report to the Governor's Office for implementation within the next two months.

“The task force shall convene on the 12th of June to commence the audit exercise across the city. The task force has 60 days to complete its work and submit a report to the Governor’s office for implementation.”

Governor Sakaja has also lifted the suspension of permit requirements and the exemption of fee payments for flood-related repairs and renovations (walls and buildings).

In addition, the governor has reconstituted the Urban Technical Committee (UPTC), inviting new representation from stakeholders including architects, urban planners, environmentalists and engineering bodies.

The UPTC is the committee responsible for deliberating and recommending the granting of building permits.

Sakaja's new directive comes in the backdrop of a court case filed in the City Magistrate's Court by Mr Victor Odhiambo.

Read: After flooding, 497,783 learners did not return to class: report

The petitioner argued that it was unconstitutional and a violation of the right to fair administrative action under Section 4(3) of the Fair Administrative Action Act for the governor to suspend construction work.

Mr Odhiambo had also said such orders should have been made by the County Executive Committee (CEC) member responsible for Urban Planning, Stephen Mwangi.

“The planning Authority with respect to county government planning functions means the County Executive Committee Member and not the Governor. Any communication on planning matters should therefore fall under the ambit of the said County Executive Committee Member,” Mr Odhiambo said in his petition.

Mr Odhiambo further faulted the governor for issuing the order without statutorily supported or backed by a gazette notice, and that there was no conduct of public participation by the County Government regarding the matter.

“Growth is a continuous exercise and it is unfair to scuttle it without a just cause. Compliance issues should be continuous and not based on the governor’s fiat,” the petitioner said.

The case will be heard and determined on June 6, 2024.

Court revokes Nakuru widow's estate control rights for concealing husband's Will,"The High Court in Nakuru has revoked the grant of letters of administration issued to Bhavna Karia, the widow of the late Nakuru-based lawyer Sandeep Manilal Karia.

This was after the court was told the deceased left behind a Will.

Justice Hedwig Ong’udi revoked the earlier ruling, noting that Bhavna had concealed material facts and misled the court when she petitioned for the letters of administration in December 2021.

Justice Ong’udi stated that Bhavna chose to proceed with her application despite knowing about the will, which is currently the subject of a grant of probate application before the Supreme Court in Australia.

""There is no doubt that the administrator knew that the deceased had left a Will but decided not to bring the same to the attention of the court whether the same is valid or not. It was for the court to rule on its validity,"" ruled Justice Ong’udi.

The will was brought to the court’s attention by Sandeep's brothers, Nalin Manilal Karia and Sunil Manilal Karia, who objected to the grant to their sister-in-law.

Sandeep died on May 9, 2021, while receiving treatment in Gujarat State, India.

He left behind a widow but no children. Sandeep was an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and the founder of SM Karia and Company Advocates.

The disputed wealth is estimated at over Sh120 million and has become contentious between the brothers and the widow.

Bhavna petitioned for letters of administration, claiming to be the first in priority to do so in cases of intestacy and sought to inherit her husband’s entire estate as the sole beneficiary.

Bhavna's petition included cash in various bank accounts, three parcels of land in Nakuru and three high-end vehicles.

Bhavna stated that she had consulted her husband's lawyer, Henry Aminga, who informed her of the will but could not establish its location.

Read: Lucy Kabuu - Star athlete, broken marriage and fight over matrimonial property

After filing her petition, she received a letter from her brothers-in-law in Australia informing her of the will in their possession.

She received an authenticated copy of the will dated February 4, 2003, on November 10, 2021.

Despite this, the brothers filed a protest on June 14, 2022, accusing Bhavna of misleading the court to obtain the grant through fraud.

They claimed they had informed her about the will, but she proceeded with the case. They presented correspondence with Bhavna's lawyers and a copy of the original will to support their claim.

The will named Sandeep's brothers, Nalin and Sunil, as executors and his father, Manilal Visram, as an alternative executor.

Sandeep left gifts of Sh17 million (100,000 pounds) for his wife and Sh50 million (300,000 pounds) for his sister Darsha Sunil.



His brothers were bequeathed Sh108 million (650,000 pounds) held at Barclays Bank, now Absa.

The deceased left all his funds and monies in India to his wife and three parcels of land in Nakuru to be shared equally among his five nephews and nieces.

The brothers argued that the will is pending a grant of probate in the Supreme Court in Australia, filed in May 2022, and sought to have the grant issued to Bhavna revoked.

The court faulted Bhavna for not disclosing this information.

""In my opinion, the acts by the administrator and her own admission as stated above amounted to concealing of material facts which ought to have assisted the court in arriving at a just decision. This was an outright breach of Section 76 (b) of the Law of Succession Act and the same warrants a revocation of the Grant of Letters of Administration issued to her on December 20, 2021,"" ruled Justice Ong’udi.

 ,"Sitting between Kokwa and Samatian islands in Lake Baringo is a beautiful scenery to behold on an islet that remains a mystery to many.

Scattered trees punctuated with rocks of various sizes and shapes create a beautiful landscape that completes the breathtaking view of the ‘Devils' Island’ amidst the lake waters.

It is one of the eight major islands in Lake Baringo, the others being Kokwa, Samatian, Lekorosi, Rongena, Parmalok, Lesukut, and Longcharo.

Even so, save for the sounds of chirping birds and the rustle of wind from the lake’s strong waves, the island, initially called Lasakut, is desolate and silent.

'Devils' den'

According to locals, no one has ever lived there because it is believed to be inhabited by devils, hence its name.

Mr Gideon Lekombe from Kokwa Island claims his family owned the Devils' Island decades ago. In the past, he says fishermen used to go there to fish, but that there were noisy wild whirlwinds at the rocky island that hampered their venture. The men eventually stopped fishing there.

“The fishermen concluded that the strange sounds were made by devils who inhabited it, and named it the Devils' Island,” said Mr Lekombe.

He claims the 11.8-acre Island is owned by the Lekombe family from the minority Ilchamus community that lives at the shores of the lake, and some members at Kokwa Island who hold the title deed of the dreaded islet.

Lake Baringo Senior Warden Jackson Komen confirmed that the main reason people don’t live on the island is they believe that it’s inhabited by devils.

“I have been to the island severally and I think the topography is the major impediment for people residing there as it cannot accommodate more than three families. It has a sharp rocky cliff with little vegetation. The winds there are also very strong, especially when there are strong tides at the lake,” he told Nation.Africa.

Failed businesses

The warden said more than three foreign investors have tried to start businesses on the island but all flopped for unknown reasons.

“Recently, one of them tried to set up some structures and even went ahead and planted trees before she left without giving any reason. The rocks have also made the area to be infested by snakes,” added the warden.

He was seconded by Mr Lekombe who said: “There was a white investor who tried to set up a hotel on the Island in the early 1970s and erected tents with the help of his two workers. However, due to the winds and the superstitions that it is inhabited by devils, he left in a huff and sought an alternative island at the Lake.""

In 2012, Mr Lekombe said, another investor also approached the family intending to set up a hotel. He had planted trees to beautify the bare rocky isle in readiness to put up structures.

“The island is very rocky, with few trees that sometimes fall off due to the topography, and that is why the investor planted trees. He requested us for the title deed but left before starting the said business,” said Mr Lekombe.

Nation.Africa learned that another investor also tried his luck in 2021, erecting portable houses and constructing a toilet on the Island. But he too, like the two others, left without giving reasons.

“The Island has remained desolate and no one has ever inhabited it since time immemorial. We have designated it to serve as a grazing field for our family during the dry seasons until we get another investor,” Mr Lekombe said.

“People dread living there because of the belief that it is inhabited by devils. As a family, we did not settle there because it is far (two kilometres away) from Kokwa Island which has social amenities like schools and hospitals. One needs to own a boat for transport.""

Strong winds

“The winds on the island are very strong and the waves at the lake intense, and it is not so good for habitation. That is why we fear living there. The winds on the island are more intense than the other islands because it has little vegetation and trees. I do not concur with the locals that there are devils on the island, it is just a belief.""

Whenever there are strong waves, boat riders keep off the island because they cannot land there safely.

“The Island has not benefited us because we do not live there and no investor has successfully set up a base there. We still believe that we will get one, but all the same, it is an asset to us. Someday, something good will come out of it, despite the strange name,” said Mr Lekombe.

A tour guide, Bashir Mohamed, who is also the proprietor of the Baringo tours and boat excursions also claimed the Devils Island has not been inhabited since ancient days, due to the belief that anyone who set foot there would be haunted by devils.

“The Island is believed to be associated with the devil. Elders claim that during the night they could hear sounds of people talking and cows, and also saw fires on the island. They also claimed that during those days, some fishermen would go fishing in that area would disappear and their bodies could not be found,” said Mr Mohammed.

“Swimming and diving are prohibited in that place because of the strong winds. Though the claims of the presence of devils is still a mystery, the family that lays claim to the Island doesn’t live there, let alone the locals. Recently, a white investor started construction and left. Nobody knows why, maybe she met the devil herself.""

 ,"""I am remorseful for my actions, I have learned my lessons. I pray for a lenient sentence.""

Those were the words of Mary Nekesa Ambani through her lawyer, three months after she pleaded guilty to helping plan the murder of Dutch tycoon Herman Rouwenhorst.

Appearing before High Court Judge Ann Ong'injo on Monday, Ms Nekesa appeared subdued, her actions weighing heavily on her face.

Even as she expressed remorse for her involvement in the murder, the role she played in the grand scheme has now strengthened the prosecution's case against the main suspect.

Ms Nekesa told the court that she was a single mother of two and wanted a lenient sentence that would allow her to take care of her two children.

She said that when she committed the offence in 2021, she had already separated from the father of her children, leaving her with the sole responsibility of caring for the minors.

""My children have been staying with their aunt, who is also a widow, since I was arrested in 2021. I am asking the court for leniency for the sake of my children,"" Ms Nekesa said.

Ms Nekesa further said that during her three years in prison, she had learnt vital skills that would help her cope with life outside prison walls.

She was charged along with Mr Rouwenhorst's widow, Riziki Ali Cherono, and Timothy Omondi Ngowe alias Rashid alias Tony Ochieng' alias Mohamed Khalid with the murder of the Dutchman and a security guard, Evans Pole Bokoro, at his home.

They allegedly committed these offences on June 4, 2021, but she entered into a plea bargain agreement with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and is now a state witness.

As a result of this agreement, the State has reduced the charge against Ms Nekesa from murder to manslaughter.

Ms Nekesa pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter in March, when the court heard that she had unlawfully killed Rouwenhorst and Bokoro. She is awaiting sentencing.

But what has Ms Nekesa done, or what is she sorry for?

By her own admission before Justice Ong'injo, Ms Nekesa was the woman who facilitated the entry of hired killers into Mr Rouwenhorst's Roco apartment in Shanzu, Mombasa, in the middle of the night.

Court records show that on the night of June 3, Ms Nekesa was taken to an unoccupied room in the apartment. Her main role was to wait until the middle of the night to facilitate the entry of hired killers into the compound to eliminate the Dutchman.

Ms Nekesa and Ms Cherono were long-time friends, so she was not new to the deceased's home.

Court records show that she was previously an employee at the apartment and also had other business dealings with the widow.

The court was further informed that Ms Nekesa introduced Ms Cherono to Mr Omondi and the two would occasionally hang out together.

Ms Nekesa said she facilitated the entry of the hired killers into Mr Rouwenhorst's Roco Apartment in Shanzu on the night of the incident.

The apartments were used as residential premises where the deceased and his family lived and included fully furnished rental units.

One day, during their time together, Mrs Cherono is said to have confided in her friend Nekesa about her intention to get rid of her husband, Rouwenhorst, by murdering him. Mr Omondi was chosen to carry out the murder.

From here, Nekesa allegedly facilitated communication between Cherono and Omondi for planning purposes.

On June 3, Cherono allegedly helped Nekesa to hide in one of the empty rooms in the apartment.

""At about 2am on June 4, Nekesa helped Omondi to enter the apartment complex,"" prosecutor Bernard Ngiri told the court earlier.

To facilitate the entry without arousing suspicion, Nekesa allegedly told Bokoro that Omondi was her guest.

The prosecution said investigators found that Nekesa and Omondi went to the empty room and planned to poison meat meant for the security dogs to incapacitate them.

Omondi then allegedly left with a metal rod concealed in his jacket. Some 45 minutes later, Bokoro was found writhing in agony.

Court records show that Omondi was accompanied by two others.

The three attackers then went to Rouwenhorst's room and assaulted him, leaving him unconscious.

The court was told that an examination of call records linked Nekesa to the location and indicated that she communicated with Cherono and Omondi before and after the incident.

""A mobile phone recovered from the suspects revealed text messages detailing a plot by Nekesa and Omondi on how the murder was to be carried out,"" said Ngiri.

According to court records, Nekesa was arrested and charged as the central figure in coordinating the killings from an empty room in the apartment where Cherono allegedly hosted her to facilitate the execution of the plans.

Investigators also mentioned that the suspect had a small tenant's gate key, which she used to open the gate for Omondi to enter the compound when he arrived at the scene.

Kibiko land row: Tension as two factions hold parallel elections,"The battle for control of the Sh100 billion Kibiko Ranch intensified on Tuesday, June 4 after two factions held parallel elections.

The exercise, which saw the factions led by long-serving chairman Moses Parantai and the other led by Moses Monik elect their leaders, came after the Kajiado County security team led by County Commissioner Joseph Taari cancelled the May 24, 2024 elections, citing insecurity and poor preparations by the national government.

In a public notice dated 3 June 3, 2024, Mr Taari said: ""Due to some security concerns arising from the purported annual general meeting of the Keekonykie Community Trust to be held at Kibiko grounds on June 4, 2024, the county security committee has declared the grounds a no-go zone.""

Read: Subdivision of controversial Kibiko land suspended

He said the order had been communicated to the two factions who had agreed to cancel the purported meeting. He said police officers have been mobilised to ensure that no one is allowed near the venue from midnight on June 3, 2024, to 6pm on June 8, 2024. He advised community members to avoid the venue for their own safety.

However, by 6am on Tuesday, the Parantai-led team had erected tents for the exercise, but a contingent of heavily armed police removed the tents and cordoned off the area, forcing the two groups to move further inland.

By acclamation, the Monik faction declared themselves the winners and left the venue to celebrate in the towns of Ngong, Kiserian and Isinya.

""My group had the right to call the elections, and the members unanimously elected me as their leader, I will do justice to all, external forces have lost,"" said Mr Monik.

At Kibiko ground, hundreds of Parantai supporters declared him as their duly elected chairman before swearing in his seven-member team. Three lawyers led him to take the oath of office and handed him the certificate. Mr Parantai blamed the Kajiado County Commissioner for postponing the elections, saying he had no power to do so.

Read: Lenku distances himself from controversial Kibiku land

""The 25-year struggle has come to an end, we will now move forward and subdivide the land to our members, the members have spoken,"" Mr Parantai said on Tuesday.

Mr Taari told the Nation that the elections on both sides were a sham and would not be recognised by the county security team, adding that the court would decide whether or not the elections were conducted according to the set guidelines.

The elections were crucial for Keekonyokie Community Trust Land members, as the person elected as chairman would oversee the subdivision of the prime 2,800-hectare, multi-billion-shilling land at Kibiko Ngong.

How Meg Whitman overcame disability and transformed eBay,"Before she became the US ambassador to Kenya, Margaret “Meg” Whitman developed an optimistic outlook. This excessive power of positivity, permitted the Princeton economics graduate and Harvard MBA bearer to transform eBay into the largest online auction platform.

In 1997, Meg operated a $600 million division at Hasbro, where she developed the business art of scaling, which enhanced her favourite business activity of solving problems. By the time she joined eBay as president and CEO in March 1998, she could instil cohesive management techniques that created eBay’s innovative success.

The company’s sophistication ensured anyone on the planet could post pictures of their products while interested clients and would bid and efficiently pay through PayPal, which was Meg's pivotal acquisition that she purchased as a subsidiary of eBay for $1.5 billion. The online auction procedure enabled Meg's development of new skills and capabilities that reverberated with clients, as the company grew larger.

Read: To succeed, enjoy what you do... and do what you enjoy

The trust she placed on people granted Meg the opportunity to set a stretch goal in September 2000, when eBay hosted its annual Analyst Day. A stretch goal is a financial projection that provides specific numbers for an institution's forecast. With eBay revenues totalling $430 million, Meg predicted that eBay would be a $3 billion company by 2005, to provide her team with an aim.

Mary Meeker, a savvy analyst who adjudicated eBay for wealth management firm Morgan Stanley, expressed her displeasure. She chastised Meg's public commitment to a specific long-term number as reckless and stupid. Mary was assured that failure to attain that goal would suggest weakness of leadership, planning, and execution, which could eventually frighten shareholders.

Unscathed, however, Meg surged on. She artfully implemented a sound business plan that consisted of a strong value proposition, which translated seamlessly into her talent pool. Her stretch goal was heeded exceptionally well as an inspirational rallying cry.

Soon, eBay began realising soaring revenues while decompressing numerous liabilities. Meg's new product innovations were consumed with receptivity by eBay users and created new emerging online markets, including the US automotive auction industry.

Meg (1)

It was at eBay, where Meg primarily adopted the chief principles as highlighted in her memoir, The Power of Many: Values for Success in Business and in Life. She led eBay from a $4 million company in March 1998 when she was hired to a $400 million business, as she transformed and scaled her managerial skills. By 2005, eBay had hit $4.5 billion in revenues, superseding her projection of $3 billion five years earlier. It went on to grow with distinction to an $8 billion virtual auction global brand, with a prosperous global marketplace.

During her tenure at eBay, the company advanced so rapidly. Meg responded by ingeniously adding exciting new acquisitions of physically disabled staff to her portfolio. Her corporate social responsibility was inspired by her childhood experience of overcoming disability.

When Meg was a newborn, her parents took her to a special hospital in New York City and doctors discovered she had dysplasia, an unusual congenital bone defect that resulted in her left hip having no socket. The hip is a ball and socket joint, the socket being a curved enclosure that contains the top of the large bone of the upper leg that allows the leg to rotate and move. In Meg's case, the surface of the hip against which her leg rested was flat instead of curved, causing the joint to become inherently unstable.

If left untreated, the implications of a child with this would result in permanent disability because the leg bone would not sit snugly in the socket, and would constantly dislocate when the child moved. When Meg began to crawl, doctors repeatedly asserted that she had to be placed in a stiff metal brace and leather straps that literally pushed her leg into her hip to create the socket.

Read: Meg Whitman, envoy with Midas touch on business

Her stroller and baby carriage were also modified to allow her legs to point out sideways, and when she was not being wheeled, she had to be carried everywhere. The strategy was to maintain a constant, steady pressure on her soft toddler bones to create the socket. It miraculously worked. It was, however, challenging for the family. Even after the braces were removed when Meg was two, she was not allowed to stand and apply weight on her hips for another six months.

When her family received permission from the doctors to let her play freely, the results were remarkable. She could walk, run and jump, just like any other child. She had no pain, and received a moment of self-validation when she gravitated to playing sports, including basketball, lacrosse and swimming, which were critical to developing her adulthood character traits of persistence and perseverance and were eventually fundamental to her administrative success.

To her delight, as eBay grew, Meg aligned the company’s principles to nurture the talents and restore the courage of the physically disabled. She integrated an entire community of staff consisting of physically challenged individuals, and explored their intellectual energy and resourcefulness, while eliminating enormous stigma that surrounded their preconceived notions and abilities. Having experienced the fright of disability, she resonated with the disparity of the physically impaired.

Kenya’s policy on family faulty on many fronts,"Anyone interested in social issues would be excited about the National Policy on Family Promotion and Protection 2023 published by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. But that excitement lasts only until you read the document.

The policy defines a family as “a societal group that is related by blood, adoption, foster care or the ties of marriage of two persons of opposite sex” (sic). This disqualifies intersex persons from marriage.

Similar discrimination is inherent in the Marriage Act, which defines marriage as “a voluntary union of a man and woman”. In chapter two, the policy defines a family as “a unit of people connected by natural genealogical links”, which is at variance with the earlier definition.

Read: Reimagining marriage and its original values

The document regrets that the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics collects information on the family but has never synthesised this into a thematic report. Thus it recommends a state of the family report after every five years.

At different points, the words “family” and “household” are used interchangeably, yet these are distinct concepts.

The statement that “polygamous households are one of the types of families found in Kenya” makes it manifest that the authors lacked a coherent approach to classification of families.

In addition, the analysis of challenges facing the family is extremely superficial and uninformed, probably an indication that no sociologist was involved in developing the document.

Under marriage in chapter three, the document observes that existing legislation does not provide guidance on how to “strengthen the marriage” but does not clarify what is meant by that phrase.

Read: Married but single: The wives paying all the family bills

What is clear is that the policy champions a normative ideology that marriage is imperative. Thus, it states that “the key policy issues are related on how (sic) to promote a culture of marriage” so that the result is “a true foundation for social order in Kenya”.

This seems to suggest that without families, there can be no social order.

The policy then proposes some vague but conservative interventions to be undertaken by the government.

These include promotion of “gender-responsive and age-appropriate programmes that help people understand sexuality framed in the context of marriage as the best option,” encouraging and promoting “dispute resolution mechanisms that safely keep couples together,” promoting “values and life skills programmes that encourage chastity and strengthen the marriage institution,” and protecting “the family institution from disruption by not allowing emerging cultures”.

Although the meaning of “emerging cultures” is not stated, it is a veiled reference to non-binary sexual orientation.

Read: Every marriage is pregnant with divorce, let’s leave room for the latter

Inlaid in these proposals are some ludicrous assumptions. One is that it is the government’s responsibility to keep couples together. This arises from the notion that marriage is a union in which people should, and can be coerced to, stay even if it is dysfunctional.

The other is that it is the government’s role to ensure sexual fidelity within marriage, notwithstanding that adultery is not a crime in Kenyan statutes. The superintending role given to the government is tantamount to meddling and erosion of the autonomy and responsibilities of couples.

The document creates the impression that Kenya is just about to invent something called the family and needs a framework on how to make it functional. The vagueness of the policy proposals means that an implementer would be at a loss as to what to do practically.

What kind of action, for example, would one initiate under the intervention to “integrate family needs in planning and property/assets acquisition and disposal?” The proposals are also littered with the word “promote,” technically an escapist and lazy way of making commitments that are not measurable.

This document has glaring, irritating and embarrassing grammatical errors. Sample this. “The role of men in ensuring family fulfils this primary function is paramount. Empirical evidence has made abundantly clear that involved and caring fathers are important to the optimal development of children.

Read: If you were to grade your marriage, what would you score?

Whether it is biological, adoptive or stepfathers, living in or outside of the home, fathers impact their children at every stage of development, and their absence has long last repercussions.”

The policy lists various statutes of relevance to the family but curiously omits the Law of Succession (Amendment) Act and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act.

The section on family safety and security does not even feature obvious types of violence such as spousal battery, rape and incest.

Reading this document leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It makes one wonder whether government officers who approved and signed this product actually read it.

In short, this is a pedestrian document that should not be called a national policy. The ministry would do the country a lot of justice by withdrawing it for a total overhaul.

G7 leaders 'fully endorse' Joe Biden's Gaza peace plan,"Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies ""fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive"" ceasefire and hostage release dealfor the Gaza war outlined by U.S. President Joe Biden and call on Hamas to accept it, a statement said on Monday.

The deal ""would lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for distribution throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and Gazan civilian safety assured,"" the statement said.

The G7, of which Italy holds the rotating presidency for 2024, reaffirmed support ""for a credible pathway towards peace leading to a two state solution.""

Biden laid out what he described as a three-phase Israeli ceasefire proposal last week, winning a positive initial reaction from Hamas.

An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Sunday that Israel had accepted the framework deal for winding down the Gaza war, though he described it as flawed and in need of much more work.

""We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,"" the G7 statement said.

"Grit, determination won Kenya swift promotion Word Rugby Sevens Series","



Kenya returns to a much-changed terrain in the Word Rugby Sevens Series that requires great effort and skill to survive in.

While Kenya suffered relegation to the World Rugby Challenger Series, World Rugby came up with a different format for the World Rugby Sevens Series starting from the 2023/2024, reducing the number of teams from 16 to 12 in both men and women’s series.

On Sunday in Madrid, Kenya, the United States of America, Uruguay and Spain won their play-off matches to qualify for 2024/2025 World Rugby Sevens Series, where they will join eight other teams. Kenya Sevens coach Kevin “Bling” Wambua reckons nothing is impossible with determination.

It is the sort of confidence that has driven Kenya Rugby Union chairman Sasha Mutai to declare that Kenya Sevens is back in World Rugby to stay, adding that he has faith in the transformation KRU has undertaken to regain core status.

But what won Kenya Sevens promotion back to the World Rugby Sevens Series after a season out?

Transform the team

When coach Wambua took over from Damian McGrath who was sacked last August, few gave him and his young team a chance of winning promotion just so soon, let alone qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Wambua’s team was given four months to transform the team.

Kenya Sevens was relegated from the World Rugby Sevens Series for the first time in 23 years last season after losing the promotion and relegation play-off.

Wambua took over at a time when Kenya Sevens and the country was at its lowest ebb. Following the team’s relegation, senior members of the squad retired almost in the same period. One of Kenya’s greatest moments in the World Rugby Sevens Series was when they stunned Fiji 30-7 to win the 2016 Singapore Sevens.

The team had reached the main Cup final four times; in 2009 (Adelaide Sevens), in 2013 (Wellington Sevens), in 2018 (Canada Sevens), and in 2018 (Hong Kong Sevens).

Wambua inherited a team that had lost Collins Injera, William Ambaka and Billy Odhiambo to retirement last year.

Other players who retired at their prime include Eden Agero, Bush Mwale, Augustine Lugonzo, Oscar Ouma and Oscar Ayodi.

Wambua’s first assignment was the Africa Cup, and he picked a young squad, recalling only three seasoned players - Vincent Onyala, Anthony Omondi and Herman Humwa - to the squad.

Patrick Odongo (Daystar), Samuel ‘TinTin’ Asati (KCB) and Nigel Amaitsa (Strathmore Leos) were some of the new players in the team. Kenya shocked South Africa17-12 in the final in Zimbabwe last September. to qualify for the 2024 Olympic Games. For the third consecutive time, Kenya will compete at the Olympics.

Beating Samurai Barracudas

They then retained Safari Sevens title, beating Samurai Barracudas 19-0 in the final, a performance that saw Wambua’s tenure as the coach extended to 2026.

Kenya Sevens rode through the three-leg World Rugby Challenger Series in Dubai, Uruguay, and Germany and finished in the top four to qualify for the promotion and relegation play-offs in Madrid where Kenya earned promotion to the top series. SportPesa’s return as sponsors with Sh126 million sponsorship in December 2022 eased things for Kenya Sevens.

“Dare to dream but more importantly, dare to put action behind your dreams,” Wambua said of the team’s winning mentality.

“We have the right people at the technical bench but there are no shortcuts in high performance. We must expose this young team to quality tournaments,” said Mutai, adding that they hope to draw the top team for Safari Sevens ahead of the World Series in December.

Team captain Vincent Onyala thanked everyone who believed and trusted in the team and above all God.

“The coaches, new talent and everyone believed in the new direction we took,” said Onyala.

Inside new state policy that recognises 'come we stay' and sex education in schools,"On May 15, 2024, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection launched the National Policy on Family Promotion and Protection, a framework seeking to safeguard the institution of family as provided for in Article 45 of the Constitution.

The policy is pegged on the order of maintaining the constitutional status quo of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society, pivotal to creating social order as it functions as an entity for educating, nurturing and caring for its kin.

What kind of marriages exist in Kenya?

The policy recognises nuclear, polygamous, blended, extended, as well as child-headed and skip-generation or grandparent-headed families.

It equally acknowledges the existence of a “kind of marriage” arrangement in the name of cohabitation, where an unmarried couple lives together in a long-term relationship that resembles a marriage.

This type of marriage is, however, unrecognised under the Marriage Act (2014), and becomes problematic when parties go separate ways and demand a share of what they built together.

Single-parent families are also recognised in this policy, breaking the tradition of looking down on these families. While it attributes the rise of these families to only imprisonment, migration, death, abandonment, divorce or separation, other painful factors force women and girls into single-parenthood. Some women and girls have become single parents out of the post-election violence, incest, gang-rape and defilement in their own communities.

Read: Silence that kills a marriage

In the slum areas, teenage girls as young as 13 years are willingly opting for marriage to seek financial, emotional and physical support because their own families can’t provide these needs. Unfortunately, they end up being abused, and when they can’t take it anymore, they exit to become single-child parents.

The policy seeks to promote gender-responsive and age-appropriate programmes that help people understand sexuality framed in the context of marriage as the best option. Is this the best option?

“It is important to recognise that in this era of urbanisation and globalisation, age-appropriate programmes will not be homogeneously palatable to the targeted family members. What is considered age-appropriate in Nairobi may not apply for a family in Bungoma or Kajiado. So we must do research to understand what is best for different families,” argues Chryspin Afifu, a gender and development expert.

“We have to think of the power imbalances in the households, socioeconomic status of the family members and access to digital devices. These days, children access online content way above their age through mobile phones or even laptops. How can we control that to protect families?”

What is the current mood of debate on “sexuality education”?

For the past two decades, the church, especially the Anglican and Roman Catholic, has vehemently refused to allow the introduction of age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education, which essentially is to prepare the children for adulthood.

Yet, the reality on the ground, backed up bystudies, is that children are having a sex debut as early as eight years depending on their environment. Those in the urban slum areas and in the poor households in the rural parts of Kenya are at the highest risk of early sex debut, an easy gateway to early marriage and contracting HIV.

In 2003, the same church unsuccessfully protested against the introduction of setbooks A Man of the People, Kiu, and Kitumbua Kimeingia Mchanga, arguing that they were pornographic and sexually explicit.

In reality, some schools, especially private ones, have embraced sexuality education in their programming for even their kindergarten pupils. Often, they are delivered in poems, and songs, and through clubs and counselling or physical exercise sessions.

The way to changing the mood from repulsive to receptive

“Let’s have a discussion. What is the cause of the opposition? Sometimes the church opposes these interventions in public but in private, in their own homes, they cannot control whatever they are protesting against.

Let’s face the reality as it is and ask ourselves, what is the worst-case scenario if we introduced these programmes? What is the weight of the losses and gains? What is the long-term damage of the opposition to the targeted groups?” Mr Afifu puts forth.

Kenyan becomes first black mayor in Northern Ireland,"A Kenyan woman who made history after being elected councillor in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, was yesterday inaugurated as the first black mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council.

Ms Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who is from Mau Narok in Nakuru County, was voted to represent the Foyleside area of Derry and Strabane Council in Northern Ireland.

During the handing over ceremony ON Monday, June 3, Ms Seenoi-Barr received the mayoral chain in the presence of five Kenyans, including her brother, Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina.

“Originally from Narok, Kenya, Lilian has dedicated her life to championing human rights, social justice, and community cohesion. With a background in social work, community development and social policy, Lilian has been instrumental in fostering integration and understanding among diverse communities in Northern Ireland,” said the introductory notes.

Marginalised groups

It was her work with local organisations focusing on supporting marginalised groups, promoting equality, and enhancing community relations that attracted her to the Social Democratic and Labour Party.

“Her leadership and dedication have earned her widespread respect and admiration, both locally and nationally. Lilian's historic appointment as mayor signifies a significant step forward for Derry and Strabane, reflecting the region's evolving diversity and commitment to inclusivity,” said the briefing.

Senator Ole Kina yesterday wrote a tweet on his X handle, formerly Twitter: “With outgoing Mayor of Derry City Patricia Logue and incoming Mayor Lillian Seenoi-Barr ahead of the official handover happening today at Guildhall, Derry City. Lillian is the first black mayor. It’s a proud moment for Kenya. She comes from Narok.”

Other Kenyans present during the ceremony were Kenya’s Deputy Head of Mission Edwin Afande, Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna and Nominated Senator Prof Margaret Kamar.

Mr Sifuna said on X that he did not only attend the inauguration, but also toured some sites.

“A tour of the Museum of Free Derry has evoked terrible memories of our own experiences with police brutality and State sanctioned violence on peaceful protesters. It took over 12 years and millions of dollars for the victims of Bloody Sunday in Derry to be vindicated. Justice comes, eventually,” he wrote.

Senate Speaker Amason Kingi, who was chief guest, congratulated the new mayor for breaking the glass ceiling.

“Today’s installation of Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr is the latest in the irrepressible rise by women to high leadership positions not just here in Ireland but globally,” said Mr Kingi, adding it’s clear proof of the gains of democracy.

 ,"Students and their families are being forced to choose university courses they can afford under the new funding model introduced last year rather than what they qualify for and aspire to study, investigations by Nation indicate.

First-year students, who were the first to use the model, have already accumulated fee balances and these are likely to rise as they progress.

The second cohort under the model is set to join in August and September this year and many students and parents have indicated that they will apply for inter-university transfers when the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (Kuccps) opens the system tomorrow.

Students who wish to change the courses they have been placed within the same university can also do so on the university portals.

Under the funding model, students are no longer guaranteed sponsorship by the government, but instead must apply every year and are financed according to their level of need as determined by the Universities Fund (UF) and the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb).

On Tuesday last week, President William Ruto met all public university vice-chancellors and one of the agenda items was evaluation of the funding model.

Students absorbed

“VCs confirmed it’s [the model] working and in the next three years, it will have improved status of public universities because all students will have been absorbed,” a brief message from State House read.

Students, however, tell a different story.

Last year, there was a delay in releasing the funds and students had to learn without money for upkeep. Some accumulated rent arrears while universities also operated without tuition fees.

Some 134,743 candidates have been placed in public universities this year. A total of 47,872 students who qualified for university admission after attaining a mean grade of C+ in the 2023 KCSE did not choose any degree course. Of these, 11,991 of them opted for diploma courses instead of degree courses, while the other 35,881 qualifiers are unaccounted for.

Joseph Raymond has always wanted to become a human resource manager. However, Raymond was forced to drop his dream course, Human Resource Management. The 19-year-old, mindful of financial constraints, had initially selected Maseno University due to its more affordable fees for the course (Sh183,600). However, he was disappointed to discover that he had been admitted to Kisii University instead, which is more expensive (Sh206,635).

“My mother, being a peasant farmer, cannot raise the required amount. Maseno University was my initial choice since I was aware of my family’s financial capability. However, the situation in Kisii leaves me uncertain about the future of my studies,” he says.

Raymond says that the prevailing circumstances have sent him back to the drawing board.

“From the look of things, I might just opt for a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with IT at Maseno University which costs Sh184,000 annually,” says the teenager.

Awarded a scholarship

Leonard Kanga, a first year student at Turkana University College is uncertain over completion of his studies after just one year.

When he travelled from his home in Elgeyo-Marakwet County last year and enrolled for a Bachelor of Education (physics and mathematics) degree at the institution, he was optimistic that the new higher education funding model would cater for his financial needs. Bachelor of Education is among the more “affordable” courses across various universities.

Kanga was classified under the less needy category and awarded a scholarship of Sh73,000 by UF and a Sh100,000 student loan from Helb. The annual fee for his programme is Sh244,000 and so his family was expected to raise Sh71,000.

“I received Sh45,000 from the Helb loan for my upkeep and the rest was paid directly as fees. I therefore have fee arrears of Sh116,000 after just one year. My poor parents were unable to clear my fees and I was thus denied a chance to sit my second semester exams,” Kanga said.

He says he luckily managed to sit the first semester examinations after local leaders, led by Governor Jeremiah Lomorukai, intervened following uproar from many students.

“I was forced to go to the village to engage in various income generating activities so that I can help my parents raise at least Sh50,000. We hope that the government will heed to our plea and increase the scholarship for the students from needy and less needy categories,” Kanga pleaded.

*Collins Omondi sat his KCSE examinations in 2022 and scored a mean grade of B- (minus). Had he enrolled at a university, he would probably be sitting his final first year examinations.

However, Omondi did not join any institution of higher learning last year as his parents asked him to delay his entry by one year to allow his sister to proceed to university first.

Read: I took the wrong course! What do I do with my degree?

“Due to financial challenges, I wasn’t able to apply for placement under Kuccps. I tried to apply this year, but found myself being allowed [to apply for] diploma and certificate courses only but my wish is to study for a Bachelor of Education course,” he said.

2023 KCSE candidates

He reached out to Kuccps and was asked to write an application letter since placement through the portal only works for the current students, in this case, the 2023 KCSE candidates. He did as directed, but when the results were released, he had been left out and now fears he might miss the chance forever.

Although the cases might be unique, Raymond, Kanga and Omondi are among thousands of students who now have to factor in the cost of the degree courses they choose following the introduction of the higher education funding model last year. They are now forced to take courses they can afford rather than what they qualify for and aspire to study.

Read: The sad cry of jobless graduates

“Despite receiving 800 more students than last year, many programmes still have capacity for more students due to our enhanced declared capacities this year. Those wishing to join UoN can take advantage of the inter-university transfer window and apply for transfer,” University of Nairobi VC Prof Stephen Kiama Gitahi said on Monday, June 3.

He announced that the university will open its portal for inter-faculty and inter-programme transfers on August 11, 2024, one week before reporting on August 19, 2024.

However, in the 2024/25 budget proposals, Helb has a financing deficit of Sh11.4 billion, making it only able to fund all continuing students and only 17.2 per cent of the first-year students who will be joining university in August and September 2024, leaving others to their own devices.

The National Assembly Committee on Education is scheduled to have a meeting with the principal secretary for Higher Education Beatrice Inyangala to discuss the funding model.

"‘I refused the 'cleansing' ritual that assumed I was unfaithful’, a widow’s horror","In 1996, Jane Wairimu lost her husband when she was six months pregnant with their last child. At the time, she was 29, residing in Bungoma, Western Kenya.

She had met her husband while working at the Agricultural Finance Corporation, and they had three children together. Their marriage was peaceful and happy. However, after his sudden death, she encountered unexpected challenges.

She shares with Nation.Africa how she was treated after becoming a widow and her seven-year journey of reclaiming their matrimonial property.

“Even though my husband was the fourth-born child, he was the most successful in his family, therefore the provider. Although his family owned land in Mumias, we decided to purchase property and settle in Bungoma, where his successful business ventures thrived. When he was alive, he was attentive to our needs,” Jane recounts.

Unfortunately, Jane’s husband died in South Africa in a tragic road accident. His secretary, Claudia, who was also a Bukusu woman, delivered the news to her. Strangely, before breaking the news, she suggested that they have lunch at her home.

Read: Let’s talk about the law of succession

When they arrived at her home, Claudia began rummaging through their belongings in the master bedroom. When Jane questioned her, she dismissed her concerns and urged her to eat.

Claudia then requested her marriage certificate, which Jane handed over without hesitation. Then, out of nowhere, she posed a chilling question: ""What would you do if you found out your husband had died?"" Shocked by her inquiry, Jane was rendered speechless.

Claudia’s subsequent words only heightened her distress, as she instructed Jane to prepare to wail, as is customary for Bukusu women upon hearing of their husband's demise.

Stunned and unable to react, Jane watched as Claudia swiftly gathered their important documents and some of her husband's personal belongings and took them to her car. Returning to the room, she began screaming. According to the Bukusu tradition, such screams serve to alert neighbours of the tragedy.

“As I remained paralysed by the unfolding events, my in-laws seized the opportunity to enter our home and strip it of our possessions. Fortunately, Claudia had foreseen their actions and hidden away their vital documents. Amidst the chaos, I felt too powerless to intervene,” she says.

With the government’s assistance, her husband's body was airlifted to Kenya and funeral preparations began.

Before the funeral, Jane was instructed by her in-laws not to shower, citing Bukusu cultural practices. According to tradition, female relatives in the community were supposed to perform a cleansing ritual on her. This ritual supposedly ensured her stability when circling her husband's grave seven times during the funeral procession. However, Jane adamantly refused to undergo this ritual, opting instead to maintain her usual hygiene practices.

Jane explains to Nation.Africa that this practice stems from the assumption that widows may have been unfaithful, and the cleansing is intended to prevent any mishaps during burial rites.

Following the funeral, Jane faced mistreatment from her in-laws. They seized all the dairy cattle from their zero-grazing unit and even took away the tractor used for farming. This marked the beginning of her frustrations.

“Despite the challenges, I chose to remain in my matrimonial home because my children were young and I was heavily pregnant. However, I decided that once I gave birth, I would relocate to Nairobi.”

Once she arrived in Nairobi, she had intended to start succession processes but was too afraid to do so.

Legal process

“I faced opposition from my in-laws. To make matters worse, my mother-in-law was living on the property, and the land's title deed only listed my late husband as the owner. On top of that, my in-laws threatened to take away my children if I decided to pursue legal action to reclaim our home.

""I was afraid of the consequences it might have on my children and the strain it could put on their relationship with their grandmother, so I hesitated to take the matter to court,"" she says.

It was after three years that she regained the courage to begin the legal process of reclaiming her property. Looking back at her hesitation, Jane admits that since her husband had not left behind a will, it was difficult.

Read: Just like sons, daughters are entitled to inherit deceased parent’s estate

Claudia had managed to sneak out crucial documents from their home, including title deeds for all of her husband's properties. On perusing the documents, she was astonished to discover that besides the 16-acre Bungoma property, her husband even owned property in South Africa.

Her efforts necessitated her to constantly make trips from Nairobi to Bungoma to attend court. This eventually led to her losing her job. Her employer terminated her contract because she had “deserted her duties”.

Despite lack of support from her relatives, she remained determined to seek justice for herself and her children. With the assistance of a compassionate lawyer and her own resilience, Jane navigated the complex legal process and eventually regained control of her assets.

What Jane went through is common among widows. This is why the Law of Succession Amendment Bill, 2023, is currently under consideration in the Senate. The bill aims to address several issues within the existing law, particularly focusing on the rights of widows.

We spoke to Senator Veronica Maina, the sponsor of the bill, and she explained that she introduced the bill because there are inconsistencies in the current Law of Succession, particularly when it intersects with marriage laws.

“These inconsistencies impact the definition of who inherits. Inheritance laws relate closely to family structures, which begin with marriage. Some definitions in marriage laws conflict with those in the Law of Succession, leading to discrimination against certain family members or dependents.”

One of the notable proposals in the bill is the introduction of the definition of intermeddling under section three of the Law of Succession Act. The definition includes removing a spouse or child from the matrimonial home after the death of a husband or father as an offense under the act.

“I know of a lot of widows who as soon as their husband dies, the in-laws swoop in and take possession of everything, leaving the bereaved family, including young children, in distress. If the bill is passed, such practices would be recognised as an offense under the Act and punishable within the law,” Veronica told Nation.Africa.

In a joint statement about the bill, Dianah Kamande, founder and executive director of Come Together Widows and Orphans Organisation, and Groots Kenya executive director Rachel Kagoiya explain what the provision would be helpful to widows like Jane.

“This means that widows and their children have the protection under the Law of Succession not to be ejected from the matrimonial home after the death of their husbands and fathers respectively. It's the first time a law has expressly provided for such with a corresponding penalty even though the penalty is not stiff,” reads part of the statement.

Read: Mum didn’t leave a will, how do we handle inheritance dispute?

Other proposals to the Succession Act seek to protect children of women born out of wedlock. “The bill clarifies inheritance rights for children born out of wedlock, supporting the principle of equal distribution regardless of the child's legitimacy or the parent's marital status. This prevents any form of discrimination,” Ms Maina explains.

Further, under current law, a widow loses life interest in her husband’s property upon remarriage, but a widower does not. The bill proposes equalising this to ensure both men and women lose life interest upon remarriage, transferring the estate's benefits to their children.

As to this, Rachel says: “Widow discrimination upon re-marriage is terminated on the basis that either spouse will lose their right to claim from the deceased’s estate upon remarriage.

“It is significant for widows for they have been losing their right to claim anything from their husband's estate if they remarried whereas men continued to enjoy the protection of the same law by being able to lay claim on the estate of their wives in a new marriage.”

 ,"Now that he is solidly on terra firma and recovered from the highs of his United States state visit, President William Ruto should take a step back and carefully review some of the things he signed on to while bamboozled by his hosts.

Our Head of State is reportedly a strict teetotaler and also not known to take any other substances that might have him assent to deals while ‘under the influence’.

However, there are other ways in which one’s judgement can be clouded, especially where the leader of a small, poor third world country is squired and flattered by the mightiest nation on the globe.

While the President came home with welcome pledges of aid, support and investment in numerous areas, there are things agreed on which will need keener scrutiny.

Of particular concern to most Kenyans must be some of the security agreements. There is no doubt that Kenya and the US are natural allies given shared threats posed by violent Islamist extremism, Al-Shabaab out of neighbouring Somalia in our case.

However, Al-Shabaab or similar groups in the region and beyond provide absolutely no justification for Kenya to drunkenly stagger into an American-led military alliance that is predicted on confrontation with Russia.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) was formed in 1949 with the specific mandate of countering westward expansion by the then-Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact communist allies. The central premise holds that if one Nato member is attacked, the other member-countries are obliged to come its defence.

It was President Joe Biden who announced during President Ruto’s trip that he would ask Congress to designate Kenya as a ”Non-Nato ally”—the first in sub-Saharan Africa and fourth on the continent, after North African states of Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, to gain the status.

However, we have heard nary a word from our own government on the benefits and risks of that.

The designation would, presumably, give Kenya access to sophisticated military equipment and training, as well as financial support on defence spending.

But unlike a formal member, Kenya will not be mandated to send troops for Nato operations; neither will alliance members be obliged to defend us should we fall under attack.

Devil in the detail



But then, the devil could be in the detail—and perceptions. Were wars to break out in Africa around resurgence of West-East hostilities, Kenya would immediately be viewed from the prism of an American vassal.

Bear in mind the conflicts being witnessed in Europe. The ongoing war in Ukraine is a direct result of Russian expansionism out of President Vladimir Putin’s mission to regain the sphere of influence lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact defence alliance.

The invasion of Ukraine, while unjust and indefensible, cannot be divorced from Moscow’s alarm over its former allies moving to join the enemy military alliance. It is countering a Western military expansionism that threatens to encircle it.

Do we want to be caught up in the middle in the event of similar West-East wars on African soil? We must say a big no and also demand that any such military links be subjected to public scrutiny and formal assent by Parliament.

Also alarming is the reported agreement, again with total opacity from our side, for Yemeni Houthi rebels captured by American and European Union navies in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to be brought to Kenya for trial.

Drawn into alien war

We are being drawn into an alien war we have no business getting entangled in. It is one thing for Kenya to hold and prosecute Somali pirates who have been attacking ships in the Indian Ocean within our region. Those are criminals with no political or ideological objectives and will be treated as such.

The Houthi rebels disrupting shipping off their coast are a different kettle of fish altogether. They are part of a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the latter backed by the US and other Western nations. If any of them are incarcerated in Kenya, we become a target. Let us not be foolish.

While reviewing all those deals, President Ruto must also take a fresh look at the influence of the World Bank-IMF twins on our budget-making process. It seems that our National Treasury and Central Bank mandarins are mere lap dogs of the Bretton Woods institutions, doing copy-and-paste jobs of demands that make the core elements of another contentious and totally objectionable Finance Bill.

President Ruto will not burnish his Pan-African credentials by always asking “How high?” when the Americans say “Jump!”

Key national mandate of MPs is paramount,"Members of Parliament are paid hefty salaries and allowances to articulate in the august House the concerns and aspirations of millions of Kenyans. A lot of their crucial work is done in the Chamber as they debate and make laws to improve the people’s welfare and protect their lives.

But, as leaders, there is much more work that they do in their own constituencies and in other national forums.

The huge investment in enabling the lawmakers to effectively carry out their mandate is made possible by the taxpayers.

That is why, in an interesting development, President William Ruto has felt compelled to reiterate that they have an obligation to criss-cross the country to discharge their mandate. He said they will be failing in their role as national leaders if they confine themselves to their electoral constituencies.

President Ruto has thus contradicted the position of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, clarifying that the MPs have a right to traverse the country and address national issues. Of course, the President is quite right that the oversight and legislative roles of the MPs are not limited to their specific constituencies.

UDA lawmakers

DP Gachagua recently told Rift Valley UDA lawmakers to keep off his Mount Kenya backyard, in an apparently mounting battle for the control of the vote-rich region. He is on record as having cautioned the MPs to “keep off the complex politics of the Mountain”.

According to the President, MPs execute three key constitutional mandates of oversight, representation and legislation. As he graphically put it, “Parliament is not a village assembly”. It is the national law-making arena where matters affecting the country as a whole are tackled. It is, therefore, quite in order for MPs to highlight or even lodge petitions on matters or any developments even outside their own constituencies.

Since they sit in the National Assembly, the MPs are national officials and should be concerned about issues affecting every part of the country. They are not tribal chiefs, who would only deal with matters concerning their communities.

Tapping into the future: Nakuru poly turns Ruto’s joke into reality,"When President William Ruto talked about young people making money by tapping their computer keyboards in Taptengelei village, Nandi County, the Rift Valley National Polytechnic in Nakuru City was already working on the concept.

Hundreds of young people from Njoro, Rongai, Nakuru Town East, Nakuru Town West and Molo flock to the refurbished digital hub at the institute daily.

The government-sponsored programme, under the Jitume Initiative, addresses challenges facing thousands of jobless young people in Nakuru and beyond.

These include access to digital devices and internet connectivity, training and knowledge acquisition as well as opportunities that can result in decent and dignified incomes.

The initiative encourages young men and women to take it upon themselves to access digital devices and opportunities, become certified in skills for the fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and access digital jobs.

Processing data

The digital laboratory has attracted youth from diverse backgrounds, including those who have completed training in different professions.

One beneficiary is 20-year-old Deborah Ondieki, a maritime logistics student at the Kenya School of Revenue Administration.

She has been using facilities at the Rift Valley National Polytechnic for the two months.

“I’m engaged in online work, processing data for global institutions,” Ondieki says.

“This reminds me that there is a global space outside Kenya where I can work virtually and earn my daily bread.”

She wants to save enough from her online earnings to complete her studies.

The institute works with Lish AI Labs to offer comprehensive artificial intelligence and machine learning training, enabling young adults to access digital services, skills and tech opportunities for job creation.

More computers needed

Rift Valley National Polytechnic Principal, Sammy Chemoiwa, says the institution signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Lish AI Labs to help young people develop digital skills that will make them competitive in the international job market.

“We train and mentor them for six months before sending them to the job market,” Chemoiwa says.

“We usually target those still in college and those who have completed studies. For now, we do not charge them anything. We also don’t ask for payment when they start earning.”

Some 123 students have been offered training, earning Sh20,000 to Sh25,000 a week.

“This is encouraging. Some students earn more than the average worker at the polytechnic,” the principal says.

The lab operates around the clock, with at least 80 students earning enough to take care of their meals, accommodation and other daily expenses.

The biggest challenge facing the programme is the limited number of computers. There are plans to increase the capacity of the laboratory to 1,000 computers.

“The lab only has 100 computers. We have talked to the government to provide us with 100 more for training and 200 for staff,” he says.

According to the principal, strategies are in place to help the trainees invest their earnings through saving models, government bonds, treasury bills, saccos and shares in companies.

"Keep off Amboseli National Park takeover, Kajiado leaders warn civil society groups","Local leaders have issued a stern warning to non-governmental organisations that oppose Amboseli National Park's takeover by the County Government of Kajiado.

This follows a statement dated May 14, 2024, posted by the East Africa Wildlife Society (EAWLS) on its online Swara Magazine opposing the transfer of the park to the county government and warning that the devolved unit lacked the capacity to manage such a vital natural resource.

The statement that was authored by EAWLS Executive Director Nancy Ogonje further cautioned that “transferring Amboseli National Park’s management to the Kajiado County Government represents a dangerous step backwards for conservation efforts in Kenya.”

“The implications extend far beyond the local community, impacting the nation’s wildlife governance framework and diminishing a resource cherished by millions,” said Ms Ogonje.

The conservationist regretted that such a move would set a bad precedent for wildlife governance in the country.

“By devolving park management to county administrations, we risk diluting the authority and expertise vested in institutions like the KWS [the Kenya Wildlife Service],” she noted.

Citing a similar clamour by the Taita Taveta County Government, Ms Ogonje went on to say that “the developments significantly threaten the conservation values and goals underpinning our cherished national heritage.”

Kenya's national treasures

“Our arguments are not speculative. They are grounded in legal, environmental, and ethical considerations. As stewards of Kenya’s natural treasures, we cannot afford to overlook the ramifications of such a decision.”

In 2023, President Ruto, speaking during a Maa cultural event in Narok County, ordered the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife to transfer the management of Amboseli to the County Government of Kajiado. The ministry then formed a committee to spearhead the process.

On Saturday last week, addressing residents during the Madaraka Day celebration in Ilbisil, Governor Joseph Ole Lenku reiterated his commitment to ensuring that the park was handed over to the county government.

He termed the Amboseli takeover issue as a matter of utmost importance to the Maa people, likening it to the conservation of the Mau Forest Complex and securing of Maa community land rights in Laikipia County.

“It is a battle that must be won,” the governor said. “I commend the eleven group ranches that have generously contributed a total of one million acres for the expansion of the Amboseli ecosystem conservation area.”

Kajiado Senator Samuel Seki charged that the NGOs had been paid to derail the process by their “Western masters”.

Nominated Senator Peris Tobiko urged President Ruto to pay closer heed to the grievances raised by the Maa people.

“The Maa don’t have access to State House to present their grievances to the Head of State. We have seen muguka, coffee and tea farmers hosted at State House. Amboseli is our muguka, it's our heritage,” said Ms Tobiko.

Controversial handover

Kajiado South MP Samuel Parashina called on Dr Ruto to “fulfil your promise to Kajiado people”.

At the heart of the controversial handover of the park are billions of shillings generated in revenues every year and which the county government stands to gain.

According to figures from the KWS, the income generated by the Amboseli National Park this year has already surpassed last year's figures. In March, KWS Director-General Erustus Kanga revealed that the park raked in Sh1.4 billion in 2023 compared to the Sh1.2 billion realised in 2022.

This, Mr Kanga noted, was even though 90 per cent of the wildlife in the Amboseli ecosystem in Kajiado South are living outside the park.

This means that the revenue potential is quite high with the anticipated extra one million acres of conservation area expected to be handed over to the park by local group ranches when the State cedes control.

Sheinbaum elected Mexico's first woman president,"Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become Mexico's first female president, inheriting the project of her mentor and outgoing leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador whose popularity among the poor helped drive her triumph.

Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City, won the presidency with between 58.3 per cent and 60.7 per cent of the vote, according to a rapid sample count by Mexico's electoral authority. That is set to be the highest vote percentage in Mexico's democratic history.

The ruling coalition was also on track for a possible two-thirds super majority in both houses of Congress, which would allow the coalition to pass constitutional reforms without opposition support, according to the range of results given by the electoral authority.

Opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez conceded defeat after preliminary results showed her taking between 26.6 per cent and 28.6 per cent of the vote.

""For the first time in the 200 years of the republic I will become the first woman president of Mexico,"" Sheinbaum told supporters to loud cheers of ""president, president"".

Victory for Sheinbaum is a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture and home to the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.

Sheinbaum is the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

""I never imagined that one day I would vote for a woman,"" said 87-year-old Edelmira Montiel, a Sheinbaum supporter in Mexico's smallest state Tlaxcala.

""Before we couldn't even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,"" Montiel added.

Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.

Read: Trump is a convicted felon. Now what?

After preliminary results were announced, she told supporters her government would be fiscally responsible and respect the autonomy of the central bank.

She has vowed to improve security but has given few details and the election, the most violent in Mexico's modern history with 38 candidates murdered, has reinforced massive security problems.

Many analysts say organized crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during Lopez Obrador's term.

Sunday's vote was also marred by the killing of two people at polling stations in Puebla state. More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico's modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down.

""Unless she commits to making a game-changing level of investment in improving policing and reducing impunity, Sheinbaum will likely struggle to achieve a significant improvement in overall levels of security,"" said Nathaniel Parish Flannery, an independent Latin America political risk analyst.

The ruling MORENA party also won the Mexico City mayorship race, one of the country's most important posts, according preliminary results.

Among the new president's challenges will be tense negotiations with the United States over the huge flows of US-bound migrants crossing Mexico and security cooperation over drug trafficking at a time when the U.S. fentanyl epidemic rages.

Mexican officials expect these negotiations to be more difficult if the U.S. presidency is won by Donald Trump in November.

Trump has vowed to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese cars made in Mexico and said he would mobilize special forces to fight the cartels.

At home, the next president will be tasked with addressing electricity and water shortages and luring manufacturers to relocate as part of the nearshoring trend, in which companies move supply chains closer to their main markets.

Read: Biden and Trump face speed bumps on path to White House

Sheinbaum will also have to wrestle with what to do with Pemex, the state oil giant that has seen production decline for two decades and is drowning in debt.

""It cannot just be that there is an endless pit where you put public money in and the company is never profitable,"" said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs. ""They have to rethink the business model of Pemex.""

Lopez Obrador doubled the minimum wage, reduced poverty and oversaw a strengthening peso and low levels of unemployment - successes that made him incredibly popular.

Sheinbaum has promised to expand welfare programs, but it will not be easy with Mexico on track for a large deficit this year and sluggish GDP growth of just 1.5 per cent expected by the central bank in 2025.

Lopez Obrador has loomed over the campaign, seeking to turn the vote into a referendum on his political agenda.

Sheinbaum has rejected opposition claims that she would be a ""puppet"" of Lopez Obrador, though she has pledged to continue many of his policies including those that have helped Mexico's poorest.

In her victory speech, Sheinbaum thanked Lopez Obrador as ""a unique person who has transformed our country for the better"".

But political analyst Viri Rios said she thought sexism was behind criticism that Sheinbaum was going to be a puppet of the outgoing leader.

""It's unbelievable that people cannot believe she's going to be making her own decisions, and I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that she's female,"" she said.

Kenya Shujaa bounce back to World Rugby Sevens Series,"Kenya Sevens are back at the World Rugby Sevens Series.

Kenyans broke into song and dance in Madrid and locally after Shujaa touched down five tries and four conversions to dismantle Germany 33-15 in the relegation and play-off duel in the Spanish capital.

“Welcome back Kenya, we have missed you!” said World Rugby on their social media pages.

It was a battle of resilience as Shujaa braved a poor start and one-man disadvantage in the first half, turning around their fortunes with good defence and open play.

Vincent Onyala, Chrisant Ojwang, John Okoth, George Ooro, and Kevin Wekesa bludgeoned through a try each as Anthony Mboya added the extras to send Kenya back to the series after a season in the cold.

It’s Chris Umeh, who completed a good flow with a try on the left corner that went unconverted before Shujaa turned in the style as Onyala touched down. Mboya converted as Shujaa took charge 7-5 only for Ojwang to be sin-binned for infringement.

Kenya Sevens players celebrate their qualification for the 2025 HSBC World Rugby Sevens season after beating Germany 33-15 in the World Rugby Sevens Series play-offs in Madrid on June 2, 2024.

Shujaa held on the Germans with good defence but it capitulated for Niklas Koch to score for the Germans to lead 10-5.

However, Ojwang returned from the sin-bin with a bang, tearing through the wing after being put through by Samuel Asati to score and even Mboya missed to convert Kenya's lead 12-10 at the break.

Onyala would latch on the kick-off loose ball to feed Okoth with a telling cross before he went flying through the poles to score. Mboya added the extras to stretch the lead to 19-10.

There was some flash of brilliance from Germany, who had beaten Kenya twice in the World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series. Maximilian Heid brought them back into the game with a try to reduce the deficit at 19-15 only for Kenya to go loose and wild with the ball.

Substitute Brain Tanga set up Ooro from the maul to go flying between the posts as Wekesa collected a loose ball after the German defence fumbled with the ball to score.

Mboya was good with his boots as the buzzer went to elicit celebrations from the players and Kenyan fans to bring back the memories from the 2016 Singapore Sevens where Kenya won the leg.

Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Sasha Mutai said the qualification is a result of hard work from several key movers in the game from last year starting with the players, technical bench, union, the government and sponsors.

“We put the right people at the technical bench through merit and that is why player selection was also on merit. There is no good luck at the top level,” said Mutai, adding that regaining the core status will not only improve the standards of players but also the Safari Sevens.

“There are no shortcuts in high performance and that is why I want to thank the National Olympic Committee of Kenya, the government and Sportpesa for the support,” explained Mutai.

Safari Sevens

Mutai said that top teams will now grace the Safari Sevens ahead of the World Series in December. "" But first things first, we must prepare well for medal contention at the Paris Olympic Games,"" said Mutai.

Mutai hailed Kenya Sevens coach Kevin “Bling” Wambua for the transformation in the team.

Team captain Vincent Onyala thanked everyone who believed and trusted in the team and above all God.

“The coaches, new talent and everyone believed in the new direction we took,” said Onyala.

Wambua took over from Damian McGrath, who was fired in August last year before his contract came to an end after the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

Unlike his predecessors, who had the luxury of a long-term contract, Wambua’s team was given a four-month contract that Sasha Sasha, who had just been elected KRU chairman, described as a “transition period.”

It was left to be known if Wambua, who is conversant with the intrigues in Kenya Sevens team management, would survive for long considering the revolving door that is Kenya Sevens coaching job.

McGrath's exit saw the high turnover of coaches at the Kenya Sevens team continues with the job having now changed 12 times since 2010.

Wambua took over at a time when Kenya Sevens and the country was at its lowest ebb after the team was relegated from the World Rugby Sevens Series for the first time in 23 years.

Top players

He came at a time when some of the country’s top players handed their boots almost the same time singling for Collins Injera, William Ambaka and Billy Odhiambo who called it quits last year. Others who retired before their prime age are Eden Agero, Bush Mwale, Augustine Lugonzo, Oscar Ouma and Oscar Ayodi among others.

However, Wambua confounded many when he guided his young team which had only three senior players to Africa Cup victory, shocking South Africa’s Blitzboks 17-12 in the final in Zimbabwe in September last year.

That victory saw them qualify for the Paris Olympic Games, the third consecutive time they will participate in the Olympics Summer Games.

They would then retain Safari Sevens, beating Samurai Barracudas 19-0, the final that saw the rise of Patrick Odongo, a student from Daystar University, who scored a brace of tries.

Co-captains Vincent Onyala and Anthony Omondi, and Herman Humwa were the only senior players in the team with the latest retirement of Collins Injera, William Ambaka and Billy Odhiambo last year among others.

That performance was enough to see Wambua's tenure as the coach extended to 2026.

Wambua’s next assignment was the World Rugby Challenger Series where they emerged second with 48 points behind Uruguay with 56 points.

Kenya Sevens launched their campaign in the three-legged series in Dubai, beating Chile 12-5 in the final. They then finished third in the second leg in Montevedio, Uruguay, once again edging out Chile 31-12 in the playoffs.

Kenya settled fifth in the final leg in Munich, Germany but had already done the work to finish in the top four and qualify for the promotion and relegation play-off in Madrid.

Kenya Sevens earned their first call for the World Rugby Sevens Series in 2000/2001 season before becoming the core team in the 2004/2005 season.

"Sword-wielding motorist attacks, injures police officer in Kasarani","A police officer is currently recuperating at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital after being attacked by a sword-wielding motorist he had arrested and was escorting to Kasarani Police Station.

According to police records, the corporal was on duty at Mirema junction on Kamiti Road on Sunday, June 2, morning when he spotted a motor vehicle making a U-turn and obstructing other road users.

This prompted the officer to approach the vehicle to clear the road for other users. However, when the driver saw the officer and attempted to flee, he swerved and, in a moment of miscalculation, hit the kerb and got stuck.

As he struggled to remove the vehicle from the kerb, the officer managed to enter the vehicle and instructed the driver to drive to the police station.

""Upon reaching the Quick Mart (supermarket), the driver suddenly stopped and pulled a sword from under the seat. The officer jumped out of the vehicle for his own safety and the driver followed him with blows and kicks,"" read part of the police report.

In the melee, the officer tripped and fell into a ditch, giving his assailant time to grab his mobile phone battery before taking off.

The officer, who was rescued by members of the public, later received first aid at Crestview Mother and Child Wellness Centre in Kasarani. He was transferred to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital for further treatment.

Meanwhile, an accomplice in the attack is in police custody as police intensify efforts to track down the driver who is still at large.

 ,"Kenya’s failure to send a single boxer to the Olympic Games for the first time in 60 years has sent shockwaves in the local boxing fraternity.

Retired boxers and coaches have weighed in, terming it “a nightmare” that the country will take long to recover from.

After three successive attempts in different qualifiers, Kenyan boxers have failed to qualify for the July 26 to August 11 Olympics.

Kenyan boxers were beaten and tossed out of the ring in the first qualifier event, the September 9 to 23 African qualifiers in Dakar, and again flopped in the first World Qualification Tournament held in Busto Arsizio, Italy, from March 3 to 11.

The straw that broke the camel’s back came in the second World Boxing Qualification Tournament in Bangkok from May 24 to June 2, where all of Kenya’s boxers lost their bouts, forfeiting all hope of competing at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

For the first time since Kenya competed in the Olympic Games as an independent country at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Kenya will not send a single boxer to the Olympics, and retired boxers have blamed it on the collapse of talent development structures, poor administration of the sport by Boxing Federation of Kenya (BFK), and general disinterest by the government in developing the sport.

Amid all these, the Sports ministry has maintained deafening silence and did not respond to telephone calls from Nation Sport.

The 1990 Auckland Commonwealth Games heavyweight champion, Joseph Akhasamba bemoaned the dwindling standards of boxing in Kenya, saying Hit Squad’s poor performance over the decades is a reflection of poor leadership at BFK.

Akhasamba, who is also the 1998 and 1999 Africa heavyweight professional boxing champion, explained that lack of development structures and boxing tournaments from the grassroots denied talented boxers an opportunity to hone their talents from intermediate to national league competitions.

Akhasamba, who won the World Boxing Board (WBB) in 2000 and 1998 Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games welterweight silver medallist Absolom Okinyi blamed the situation on the decision by local companies to abolish their boxing clubs. Kenya Airways, Kenya Breweries, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), Postal Corporation of Kenya (Posta), and Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC) discontinued sponsorship for their boxing clubs and retrenched the boxers, most of whom were employees.

Clubs folded up

Clubs such as Kimbo and Rivatex which were previously bankrolled by East African Industries Limited and Rift Valley Textiles respectively, have since folded up, while Motcom which was bankrolled by Ministry of Transport and Communication, was discontinued as the government moved away from sponsoring sports clubs as part of the restructuring.

“Retrenchment rendered most of these boxers jobless, and most of these clubs collapsed,” says Akhasamba.

That left only three teams from the disciplined forces - Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Police and Kenya Prisons - active.

“Today, regions don’t field full teams in national championship as was the case in the past,” Akhasamba says, adding that in his heyday, national team coaches were spoilt for choice, with up to eight boxers to pick from in any single category.

“Right now, Kenyan coaches only have KDF, Police, Prisons and a few other regions to pick boxers from. Boxing can’t thrive under such conditions. We end up fielding ill-prepared teams in championships,” Akhasamba, who competed for Kenya Breweries Boxing Club in 1986, says. He wants the intervention of former boxers and coaches. “The government must intervene and come up with a solution instead of b spectating,” says Akhasamba.

Two years after competing in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games where he was eliminated in the preliminaries, Akhasamba won gold at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, and at the 1991 African Games (formerly All-Africa Games).

Akhasamba’s victory at the African Games earned him a ticket to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics where he reached the quarter-finals.

“Having good facilities to nurture boxers is key. We need talent development structures right from the grassroots,” says Akhasamba.

The 1998 Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games welterweight silver medallist Absolom Okinyi has blamed talent flight on lack of lack of structures to absorb players. He singles out Team Kenya boxers Peter Kariuki and Fred Munga who stayed behind in Australia after the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

“Seeing nothing to return to after the Commonwealth Games, they opted for greener pastures abroad. This must change if we are to perform well again in boxing,” says Okoth, explaining that boxers should be put on professional contracts.

Overhaul of boxing

“Kenya Police team ‘Chafua Chafua’ no longer bites and there is a need for a total overhaul of boxing, even at the institutional level. Perhaps the government should set up sports academies across the counties to lure youngsters to take up education and sports.

“Most boxing local facilities only have punching bags and gloves, nothing else. We must transform social halls into fully equipped boxing facilities with the help of the county governments to nurture talent,” states Okinyi.

Patrick “Mont” Waweru, who represented Kenya in 1984 (Los Angeles) and 1988 (Seoul) Olympics says lack of involvement of former boxers in the development of the game is hurting the sport. He blames BFK officials for being intolerant to divergent views and harbouring selfish interests.

“We all can't be teachers but some of these coaches can learn something from us if they invite us to some of these national team training sessions,” says a dejected Waweru.

He wants BFK to have structured programmes to enable local boxers to train in countries which have excelled in boxing like Cuba.

“Such these trips should be well structured and not a one-off affair. We shouln’t take boxers there few days to a major event, they won't be helpful that way,” Waweru says.

The 2010 Commonwealth Games flyweight silver medallist, Benson Gicharu, reckons that lack of investment in junior programmes has left a big void, making it difficult to nurture talent.

Former boxer Athanus Nzau wants a total overhaul of BFK’s leadership and the national team’s technical bench, saying there will be no delivery both in administration and coaching so long as Benjamin Musa (Treasurer) and David Munuhe (Secretary General) continue serving as coaches.

 ,"Everybody had something to say about President William Ruto’s recent trip to the USA.

I have a lot to say too. My first question was whether we needed nearly the whole of government travelling with him.

Most were joyriders, obviously.

A minister or two, a few advisers and one or two journalists would have sufficed.

The same government that keeps telling Kenyans there is no money for projects to help the citizens went ahead and splashed millions of shillings on a trip that lasted just a few days.

Secondly, it was about the cost of the private jet. Like many other people, I believe it was a waste of money.

The amount paid for it should have been used to secure seats on our national carrier, Kenya Airways (KQ).

The President's claim that the jet was gifted to him just opens a can of worms.

What, pray, was the intention of the benefactors?

Great opportunity

Surprisingly, at the time our President flew on a private jet, Iceland's Prime Minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, used Kenya Airways while on an official visit to Malawi, making Kenyans feel very proud of their airline, “The Pride of Africa”.

Since President Ruto was on a state visit, he, of all the Kenyans, ought to have used KQ. It would have shown that he was the first to show pride in it.

The other issue was that failing to use KQ led to loss of a great opportunity to market Kenya’s tourism industry.

A view of President Ruto disembarking from a well-bedecked KQ aeroplane would have left a positive imprint on the minds of Americans and enticed many of them to visit Kenya.

What had that plain and, frankly, boring-looking Emirati private jet to do with the business being conducted on a presidential tour of the US?

The trip was overshadowed by a lot of petty issues that could have been avoided.

It did not appear like the officials representing Kenya were on an official visit but more of a private tour.

For the life of me, I will never know what some politicians from the opposition had to do with the trip.

Does that not compromise their role of oversighting the government?

It would also have been fair to consider a female comedian alongside Eddy Butita.

And now, to the issue of holding hands.

Splitting hairs

When President Ruto held his wife Rachel’s hand as they disembarked from the aeroplane in the US, the 'Men’s Conference' in Kenya apparently was splitting hairs over the matter. How dare he?

Well, that is what I can hear from their lamentations anyway.

The President may have been mocked for holding the First Lady’s hand but the fact that men are bothered by it is what I find bothersome and concerning.

It shows how patriarchal our society still is. That a simple gesture of affection and love between African couples in public is considered wrong because it allegedly emasculates the man.

It means Kenya still expects women to walk 20 steps behind their husbands; otherwise, allowing them to walk shoulder-to-shoulder with their husbands would make the women metamorphose in a puff of smoke and turn into men, hence weakening them.

A country that thinks in this manner sadly has a constitution that advocates equality among the genders.

There is even a ministry dedicated to gender issues, for God’s sake!

Despite measures put in place to level the ground for gender equality, the institute that runs the men’s conference seems to be stuck in 1BC.

This group is of the view that women must not be celebrated in public by their husbands and should be confined to the kitchen like in the medieval period.

Feminist ideology

Don’t get me wrong. And, before you start accusing me of pandering to the feminist ideology, my issue is that it sounds like it would please the men’s conference to see women walk on their knees 20 metres behind them and only around to be seen and not heard.

Theirs is the thinking that contributes to violence against women. For, to say a woman does not to deserve to be shown love in public is akin to saying she only deserves to be treated in the worst manner before other men so as not to weaken their power.

On the other hand, a couple that displays affection between them—just like those that do violence—sets an example for the children and society to follow. Which would men’s conference prefer?

President Ruto’s gesture of showing his wife affection seems to have led to his being 'summoned' by the men’s conference.

I hope he will not respect the summons. For it would mean that he, too, holds patriarchal and sexist views like they do.

Voyage zaps Betfred Epsom Derby,"It is true we have heard it before, but usually in the Grand National. Pat Dobbs was unseated on Voyage 28-1, a few seconds after the Betfred Epsom Derby, but he carried on regardless.

Voyage was on a mission to succeed, no matter what. And he did. But sadly, it was nullified without Pat at his helm. It was very entertaining, mind you, as the other fifteen runners carried on being serious. Declared the greatest of Aiden O'Brien's ten Derby Classic titles, City of Troy (Ryan Moore 3-1), stayed mid-division as Euphoric set ablaze with Los Angeles.

Between thanking Coolmore Stud and Ballydoyle, Aiden again went back to the errors he had made before City Of Troy's comeback in Qipco's 2,000 Guineas. ""We knew it went wrong. He was too fresh, unprepared and blew up in the stalls when he went in – and that's the reality of it.

Ryan Moore, winning his fourth Derby, once again proved the perfect partner for a pressure-cooker occasion, although he admitted City Of Troy's initial speedy response caught him unawares.

""We were able to pick a path and he took me there fluently. The race was over and he was in control of it a fair way out. Still a little bit inexperienced with Voyage in front of him, Troy was too special to worry about it.""

""He showed so much as a two-year-old and it's great that Aidan has got him back, didn't lose faith in the horse, stuck to the plan and it paid off. We believed if he turned up like we thought he would he'd be too good for them – and he was.""

Although Aiden usually heaps praise on Ryan in these moments, the maestro reversed roles as he paid tribute to a genius.

""He's been breaking records for so long now it's ridiculous – there's no one like him. It's more than being a genius with attention to detail and dedication. Everyone works hard in this game, but I've never known anyone work harder than him. Before his defeat at Newmarket, City Of Troy had been spoken about as both a potential Triple Crown hope and a Breeders' Cup Classic challenger. He could yet bid to seal his legacy on dirt in the United States.

""It's always been our passion to try and win the Classic,"" said Michael Tabor, part-owner of City Of Troy with Sue Magnier and Derrick Smith. ""We were second with Giant's Causeway and, being by Justify, surely we'll give it a try eventually.""

Electricity transformer theft menace: Government deploys police officers to trace criminals,"The government has assigned groups of police officers in Homa Bay County the responsibility of tracking and smoking out criminals who engage in theft of electricity transformers.

The officers will work together with other agencies to make sure that criminals who steal the transformers are apprehended and arraigned.

County Commissioner Moses Lilan said the region has become synonymous with power blackouts caused by vandalism of public infrastructure, especially electricity transformers and power lines.

He said a team of police officers was trying to address the menace by tracing the criminals.

""The officers are drawn from the Critical Infrastructure Police Unit (Cipu). Vandalism of transformers must stop,"" Mr Lilan said.

Kenya Power has been reporting huge losses caused by vandalism and theft of its equipment used for supplying electricity to homes and businesses.

Mr Lilan said the latest case in Homa Bay happened in Rangwe where unknown individuals stole transformers and dumped them at a field in Rangwe Town alongside a vehicle that was used to ferry the stolen gadgets.

""Another incident was reported in Omoya. These are just a few reported incidents,"" the county commissioner said.

When transformers are stolen, criminals break them open to steal copper wire and cooling oil.

The copper is sold to scrap metal dealers for recycling.

Mr Lilan described people involved in the illegal business as economic saboteurs who do not wish the county to grow.

He compared the act of stealing transformers to terrorism saying criminals found to engage in the business will be charged accordingly.

""Whoever puts a whole village or a neighbourhood into darkness for a whole week or a whole month are economic saboteurs,"" Mr Lilan said.

The CIPU team has been tasked to investigate the theft of Kenya Power property and report the cases and arrest suspects.

""We cannot allow criminals to use transformers for their own benefits. I don't know where they take the oil,"" he said.

Shujaa completed their pool outing strongly when they landed six tries to thrash Chile 36-7 top finish with two wins and a loss.

Hosts Spain topped with nine points after they completed their campaign with a clean sheet, beating Samoa 31-0.

Kenya, who led Chile 17-7 at the break, started their campaign strongly on Friday, beating Samoa 19-12 before going down 10-5 to hosts Spain.

Kenya will be going out for revenge against the Germans at 6.20pm today in one of the quarter-finals where all the four winners will earn promotion to the World Rugby Sevens Series.

Gachagua wants Mt Kenya ‘traitors’ to be named and shamed,"The political tension in Mt Kenya has escalated as Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua called on the region to name and shame some local leaders being used by outside forces to scuttle his unity push in central Kenya.

Mr Gachagua who spoke in Nanyuki Town, Laikipia county on Saturday night said the few traitors were guns for hire, but noted that the community had always had such characters right from the time of the Mau Mau war of independence.

“The issue of sellouts within our community is not something new. There were individuals who collaborated with the colonial masters for some short-term personal benefits instead of sacrificing for the great good of the larger community,” he said.

Mr Gachagua reiterated his push for more allocation of resources through the one man-one vote- one-shilling formula and termed Mt Kenya leaders opposed this push as working on the behest of enemies bent on causing disunity.

“Whenever they visit the rural areas, let them explain their stand on the one-man-one vote –one shilling and if they support my bid to unite the mountain.

""Those who do not support and fail to accompany me whenever I am drumming support for unity should be earmarked for voting out when the time comes,” he said.

The DP who was accompanied by over a dozen MPs drawn from Nairobi, Kiambu, Nakuru, Murang’a, Nyeri, Laikipia and Meru counties said he would not abandon his agenda of uniting the mountain so that the region could increase in stakes on the political bargaining table.

Laikipia East MP Mwangi Kiunjuri who recently differed with the DP on his approach in uniting the region was conspicuously absent during the evening musical extravaganza at Old House Restaurant. Governor Joshua Irungu, Senator John Kinyua, Women Rep Jane Kagiri, Laikipia West MP Wachira Karani and Mr Thuo Mathenge of the New Democrats Party were in attendance.

Mr Kiunjuri, The Service Party (TSP) leader has in the recent past differed with the Deputy President, considered the de facto kingpin in Mt Kenya region owing to him being the second in command in the country.

The Laikipia East MP has faulted the DP’s approach in forging political unity in Central Kenya, arguing that a united mountain must start with mutual respect among all.

“The DP is the real cause of his political woes, both in the regional and in national politics, owing “to the demeaning mien that demands all to submit to him like school children,” Mr Kiunjuri said during a recent interview at a vernacular radio station.

The TSP leader claimed that he had evidence on how the DP has been threatening and demeaning not less than 38 elected leaders in the region, chasing some away from functions and planting opposition against others on grounds of forcing them to submit to him.

During the Saturday Music extravaganza dubbed Ngogoyo and attended by renown Kikuyu musicians, Mr Gachagua heaped praise on former Laikipia Women Rep Cate Waruguru who has already declared her interest to contest for the gubernatorial seat in 2027, a seat Mr Kiunjuri is also considering.

“This youthful leader can never betray the community. I Request you to pray for her and give her support when that time comes,” the DP told nearly 1,000 revelers during the musical party.

Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara lashed at Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru over her recent claims that the call unity is a strategy to quit the Kenya Kwanza Government.

“We voted for this Government and there is no way we shall move out. bUt we shall continue pushing for a united mountain,” said Ms Kihara.

Kenya to gain from Sh1.7bn pest control options,"Kenya is among nine low and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America that will benefit from more than $13 million (Sh1.7 billion) in funding by CropLife International to boost pest management.

CropLife is a global trade association of agrochemical firms based in Belgium.

The five-year funding, dubbed Sustainable Pesticide Management Framework (SPMF), is on in Kenya, Morocco, Thailand and Vietnam.

According to CropLife, the SPMF is rooted in the industry’s foundational commitment to the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management.

It also paves the way for the adoption of new technology to support the demand for sustainable alternatives and practices such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

The programme makes specific reference to Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHPs). It is envisaged that by 2035, stakeholders will have taken effective measures to phase out HHPs in agriculture.

It is also expected to yield safer and affordable alternatives; and to promote transition to the alternatives.

Farmers are learning to control an increasing number of new invasive species.

“With a warming planet, tackling pollution, protecting biodiversity and boosting food security are complex and interlinked challenges. They must be addressed in a horizontal, holistic and inclusive manner,” said Emily Rees CEO of CropLife International

CropLife launched SPMF together with BASF Agricultural Solutions, Bayer Crop Science, Corteva Agriscience, FMC Corporation, Sumitomo Chemicals and Syngenta AG in 2021.

As global temperatures rise, there has been a dramatic increase in invasive pests and diseases, which in combination with water scarcity challenges affect overall crop productivity, she said.

Kajiado County raises concern over toxic Ipomea weed,"The Kajiado County government has declared toxic Ipomea weed a disaster because of its negative effects on pastures.

The pasture-colonising weed, known as 'oltiameleteti' in the Maa dialect has spread rapidly across Kajiado County since 1997, when it was first discovered after El Niño rains, and now occupies at least 40 per cent of the total land area.

During Madaraka Day celebrations on June 1, Governor Joseph Lenku launched the Ipomea uprooting exercise to be replicated by pastoralists across the vast county.

""This weed has become a monster that threatens our food security. The weed has thrived due to poor land use, including overgrazing in a small part of the grazing land. The only way to eradicate this weed is to uproot it,"" said Governor Lenku.

He is keen to partner with other stakeholders to eradicate the weed, especially now that the county is on the path to modulated pastoralism.

""Although the county government is implementing several programmes to eradicate the weed and boost livestock production, additional funding is needed. The eradication of the plant requires a holistic approach,"" he added, saying that researchers at the University of Nairobi have initiated advanced research on how to scientifically eradicate the weed.

Kajiado Senator Samuel Seki said he has petitioned the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock through the Senate seeking answers on the government's preparedness to eradicate the weed that has spread to most Arid and Semi-Arid counties.

""I am waiting for the ministry's response on its preparedness to eradicate the weed. Both levels of government should allocate funds to eradicate Ipomoea and I want a replica of the 'Kazi Mtaani' programme to be rolled out for youths in the affected counties,"" said Senator Seki.

Kajiado County Director of Livestock Eric Aheda said the plant has a high seed rate, heavy foliage, well spread and developed root system, aggressive natural pasture competitor and smothers natural pasture in its proximity.

""This weed is highly adaptable to harsh conditions and outperforms the traditional grass. Despite the recent heavy rains, pastoralists will soon face fodder shortages,"" he said.

Kajiado West, South, Central, East and North sub-counties have borne the brunt of the weed, causing panic among pastoralists.

""The highly invasive plant, which is inedible to livestock, has spread so fast. Livestock farming seems untenable in the near future,"" said Mr Moses Lenkaso, a pastoralist.

Mr Sankare Japan, a pastoralist from Kajiado Central Sub County, told the Nation that the weed has affected honey production in the county.

""The highly flowering weed attracts bees and in return, the honey produced makes consumers doze off after consumption. The honey is said to be of poor quality and unmarketable.""

Ipomoea belongs to the sweet potato family. This species is reported to be a recent weed colonising rangelands in Kajiado County. The species is characterised by prolific growth, and a beautiful inflorescence and is highly responsive to even marginal rainfall. The weed can grow to a height of more than 2 metres and a stool can spread up to 4 metres in diameter.

The weed exacerbated the severe drought of 2020-2022 in Kajiado. Hundreds of livestock succumbed to the drought, shaking the food security of the local community, and at least 350 families faced starvation, according to the National Drought Management Authority.

The county's livestock sector has seen its annual turnover drop from Sh3.2 billion to Sh1 billion in the past three years.

 ,"Political confrontations fuelled by premature 2027 campaigns for governorship have rocked several counties, threatening services.

Some of the leaders embroiled in bitter infighting rode to power on the same party tickets, but can no longer see eye-to-eye over disagreements linked to alleged mismanagement of county resources as well as political ambitions by those eyeing the top county job.

Some of the disagreements have snowballed into bloody confrontations, resulting in physical injuries, and even death.

Counties in the eye of heightened political storm include Kiambu, Migori, Kisii, Meru, Bomet, Kericho, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Nakuru.

Kiambu County is the latest to witness a bloody confrontation where a man was shot dead and others injured following a violent confrontation pitting two rival camps.

Clash with MPs

One group is perceived to be allied to Kiambu Governor Kimani Wamatangi and the other is reported to be leaning towards Kikuyu Member of Parliament and National Assembly Leader Kimani Ichung’wah, Thika Town MP Alice Ng’ang’a, Gabriel Kagombe (Gatundu South) and Elijah Njoroge (Gatundu North).

Mr Kagombe was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of being involved in the shooting incident. The MP is expected in court on Tuesday.

Ms Ng’ang’a has declared interest in running from the governor’s seat in the next election and has been critical of Mr Wamatangi’s administration. The two have had running political wrangles culminating into a violent clash.

Recently, the two opposing camps clashed over the ownership of Kiganjo market in Kamenu Ward valued at Sh55 million. Kamenu Ward Representative Peter Mburu, an ally of the governor, is said to have mobilised his supporters and allocated them space in the market. He insists the market project was done the county government.

But Ms Ng’ang’a is adamant that the project is an initiative of the national government.

“It is deeply regrettable that, despite successful lobbying for Kiganjo market and extensive public involvement, the residents of Kiganjo are being denied their rightful share due to poor leadership. How long will Governor Wamatangi, through his associates, Kamenu MCA, and liaison officers, continue to undermine the national government’s projects?” Asked Ms Ng’ang’a in a social media post.

“I urge the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to act swiftly and probe the events that occurred in Kiganjo…it is time to prioritise the welfare of the people; incitement and political confrontations must become a thing of the past,” she added.

But Mr Wamatangi has blamed some MPs for the wrangles in Kiambu. He accused the leaders of attempting to seize public land surrendered by food processing company Del Monte in Thika.

Del Monte land

“Del Monte had ceded 100 acres whose title was not handed over to the county. When I became the governor, the county was allocated 690 more acres. Cartels, including politicians, started crafting a way to grab the land but I refused. I told them to write letters indicating the development projects they intend to undertake on the public land, that is when they started fighting me,” claimed the governor.

In April, the venue for a football tournament organised by Ms Ng’ang’a had to be changed after unknown people emptied heaps of manure at the Thika Municipal Stadium. Ms Ng’ang’a and Mr Wamatangi later engaged in a bitter exchange over the incident.

In Migori, Governor Ochilo Ayacko and MPs Mark Nyamita (Uriri) and Peter Masara (Suna West) have been locked in bitter political exchanges. Mr Nyamita is reported to be eyeing the governorship.

The confrontation forced Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga to convene a crisis meeting to try and reconcile the leaders. Mr Masara attended the May 8 Central Committee meeting and was made to shake hands with the governor, but Mr Nyamita skipped the forum.

ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna, in a statement, blamed State machinery for instigating violence in opposition-run counties.

“What has emerged from the briefing is that there is a clear and calculated plan to use State power to destabilise ODM-run counties and constituencies in partnership with rogue members of the party, some subject to ongoing disciplinary proceedings, who have since pledged allegiance to the regime in power,” the statement said.

Last month, two people were injured in Rapogi village, Migori County, during a clash pitting supporters of Governor Ayacko and Mr Nyamita at a funeral. Police had to fire teargas at mourners to calm the situation.

Mr Nyamita, in an interview with Sunday Nation, blamed the governor for the violence. He claimed that no development is happening in Migori as a result of a disorganised leadership.

‘Cover-up scheme’

“What we have are people who mobilise for violence against those critical of them. We have to be tolerant of each other for the county to realise its potential,” said Mr Nyamita.

He claimed that the meeting called by Mr Odinga was purely a scheme to cover up for the incompetence of the governor.

“No one has declared interest in the governor’s seat during 2027 election. We are just doing our job as elected leaders. The party should question the leadership of the county on what it is not doing right instead of asking us to go slow on him,” said the MP.

Mr Odinga last year appealed to ODM elected leaders to shun premature campaigns and deliver to the electorate.

“We have four more years to go, and this politicking is bringing a lot of tension. People are campaigning to become MCAs, and the elected MCAs are campaigning to be MPs. They have hardly served the people to qualify for these positions,” Mr Odinga said last November.

""We have people elected as MPs who are campaigning to be governors. You have hardly served the people as a Member of Parliament, yet you have already formed a committee for you to campaign to be a governor,"" he said.

In Kisumu, Deputy Governor Dr Mathew Owili, Senator Professor Tom Ojienda and MPs Aduma Owuor (Nyakach) as well as Joshua Oron (Kisumu Central) have been accused of engaging in early campaigns to succeed Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, who is doing his second and final term.

In Kisii, Governor Simba Arati and South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro have been engaged in a vicious power struggle.

Mr Arati has claimed that those seeking to destabilise his leadership are well-known individuals whose agenda is to make him lose in the next election by painting him as violent.

“My opponents have criminalised every noble initiative that I initiate, including my efforts to empower boda boda riders,” he said recently.

But Mr Osoro has insisted that it is the governor to blame for the chaos in the county. He has threatened to sue Mr Arati for linking him to the chaos that erupted in a meeting at Nyakembene market in which four people were injured.

In Nandi, the working relationship between Governor Stephen Sang and Senator Samson Cherargei has not been rosy. Mr Cherargei has accused the county boss of failing to deliver on his manifesto. In turn, Mr Sang’ says the senator is engaging sideshows. He claimed that the senator was busy hopping from one talk show to the other without any knowledge on what is happening on the ground.

Mr Cherargei told Sunday Nation that the issues he is having with the governor were purely about services. He alleged that the governor cannot account for resources allocated to the county.

“There is poor performance in Nandi County, from poor roads, no drugs in hospitals, poor governance, corruption and ghost workers and violation of the law especially in procurement for flagship projects that are not yet completed. He cannot account for the money,” said Mr Cherargei

Barchok’s headache

In Bomet, Governor Hillary Barchok is involved in a contest with Senator Hillary Sigei which has sucked in a section of MCAs. Prof Barchok has accused Mr Sigei of waging a smear campaign against his administration.

“The senator has been fuelling divisions in the county with the aim of painting my administration in bad light. I can assure you that he will not succeed and we will face him head on,” the county boss told a public rally at Bomet Green Stadium in September last year.

Mr Sigei said that he is only doing his oversight job.

Ms Karanja has accused the governor of walking back on pledges she made to voters during the campaigns.

In Trans Nzoia, there is a lull in public spat between Governor George Natembeya and his deputy Philomena Kapkory. But tension still remains, with the two not seeing eye-to-eye in the running of the affairs of the county.

In an earlier interview with the Nation, Ms Kapkory said their falling-out was because Mr Natembeya allegedly reneged on a pre-election pact, including sharing of county government slots.

The county boss has, however, dismissed the claims by his deputy, accusing her of abandoning her role as Deputy Governor to operate from Nairobi.

Lake Olbolosat begins to show signs of life after the long rains,"The recent long rains have brought a glimmer of hope for the restoration of Lake Olbolosat. The lake's water capacity has increased to 40 per cent, a significant improvement from its previous level of less than 10 per cent in March.

The sole highland lake in central Kenya had completely dried up, resulting in increased conflicts between the local community and hippos. This situation changed with the onset of the El Nino rains.

""The boats are back, there are vibrant activities within the lake and visitors are back. Last weekend, we attended to more than 300 customers visiting to enjoy the serene environment, boat riding, hippos, and bird watching. We need to sustain the pace,"" said Mr David Ng'ang'a, the Lake Olbolosat Beach Management Unit (BMU) chairperson.

Mr Ng'ang'a applauded the community's efforts to restore the lake, saying the journey will be more fruitful if every community member joins the efforts.

He further called on the county and national government to support the community’s campaigns to reach all the lake’s catchment areas.

""We have some underground water tunnels running as far as Mirangine and Ndondori Hills that empty into Lake Olbolosat,"" said Mr Ng'ang'a.

Lake Olbolosat's catchment areas include Satima escarpments to the east and Ndundori-Tumaini ridge to the west. It also gets its water from direct rainfall, underground springs and rivers that flow from Ol Joro Orok area.

""We cannot classify this as flood water. The rains are heavy, so the amount of inflowing water is also massive, that is why it looks more like flood water,"" said Prof John Githaiga, an environmental expert at the University of Nairobi.

Prof Githaiga added that the water flows into the lake in a spectacular and muddy state due to different factors. He noted that the impacts of prolonged drought and overgrazing on the environment around the lake have affected the inflow.

He was concerned that after the heavy rains stop, the lake's present water level may fall due to inefficient catchment and reduced water holding capacity, causing it to dry again during the dry season.

""Having water today would not mean that the lake has been revived. We need to ensure that the water is there and continues coming into the lake for a prolonged period. That is why we have to restore and manage our ecosystem so that we do not go through this periodic dry and flooding time again.”

Forest conservation, according to environmentalists, sustains ecosystems. While the community around Lake Olbolosat has planted trees that have yielded fruit in the lake's restoration, there are concerns about the lake not achieving its full restoration due to harmful trees like eucalyptus planted around it.

Some residents have been reported to be reluctant to uproot the eucalyptus trees.

The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) has listed Lake Ol Olbolosat among the priority wetlands because of its unique features.

Caroline Muriuki, principal wetlands officer at Nema, said the wetland restoration strategy aims to direct efforts towards saving the lake.

""The lake supports five other counties downstream. So, if we lose it, then we are losing the Ewaso Nyiro River, which supports five other counties downstream and, significantly, the pastoralist community. That is why it is a priority for us to see to it that the lake is restored,"" Ms Muriuki told participants during a science café organised by the Media for Environment, Science, Health and Agriculture in Nairobi.

This is the first-ever wetland restoration strategy developed by Nema. Ms Muriuki said the legal framework will guide activities done by different players in wetlands management and conservation. One of the activities she hopes to achieve is uprooting eucalyptus trees around the lake.

""Planting the eucalyptus on the riparian areas of wetlands is more destructive than helpful to the wetland. As much as we want vegetation cover, specific vegetation can be planted on those riparian areas to help conserve the wetlands,"" said Ms Muriuki.

She encouraged planting bamboo trees around the lake because they have diverse benefits for the ecosystem and support community livelihood.

""Bamboo has a commercial value. It is also good in holding the ground around the riparian land that is usually losing soil that ends up in the wetlands and causes siltation and shallowing of the wetlands, which is now happening at Lake Olbolosat.”

Her sentiments were shared by Mr Wachira Mugo, Nyandarua’s Water, Environment, Climate Change and Tourism Executive.

""The lake is facing serious challenges of siltation, water abstraction from Aberdare Forest and River Malewa, encroachment and grabbing, and many other challenges that are about to fast consume the highlands lake in Kenya,"" said Mr Mugo.

However, Jabes Okumu, programmes and advocacy manager at The East African Wild Life Society, warned that the return of Lake Olbolosat, due to its shallow depth, may expose the population to flooding disasters.

""We are likely to witness an increase in the flood plains and expose communities around that area to flooding. Wetlands are meant to regulate water flow, and by the time it starts to flood, it means the carrying capacity of that wetland is exhausted, so the water has to flow,"" said Mr Okumu.

He added that it is not yet time for the community to celebrate the lake's rebirth. He said the 40 per cent water capacity might diminish when the heavy rains stop, which might affect water quality and the ongoing activities within the lake.

He added that their research shows that when the lake dried, people blocked the water from streaming into it through farming activities and domestic use. He is concerned that history might repeat itself once the heavy rainfall stops.

""Drying of the lake is a complex thing. Beyond it being shallow and at a high altitude, we also have a lot of anthropogenic pressures. Out of the over 10 springs and streams that we marked, we found a lot of water abstraction, leaving the lake with little water supply,"" said Mr Okumu.

 ,"President William Ruto on Saturday, June 1 told politicians to stop whipping up ethnic emotions amid divisions in the ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA).

It is the third time in weeks that the President has spoken against ethnicity in politics, having done the same on Labour Day and during the Prayer Breakfast on Thursday.

Last evening, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki termed the “mobilisation and incitement” of ethnic communities against one another as a “barbaric, cruel and dangerous political misadventure that poses grave danger to our country”.

“Kenya’s ugly past experience with ethnically brewed violence should jolt us, whatever tongue we speak and whichever part of the country we come from, to resist and to name and shame the propagators of ethnic hate and the ‘us’ versus ‘them’ narrative that nearly destroyed Kenya in December and January of 2007 and 2008,” Prof Kindiki posted on X.

“Grateful to President Ruto for reminding us...to eschew ethnic politics as the sure way of shielding ourselves from taking the slippery path of hate that has destroyed many countries. Our common survival, the unity of Kenya and the security of our homeland supersedes any other loyalties we may be tempted to pursue.”

The President’s message was also reinforced in social media posts by top allies, including Majority Leader in the National Assembly Kimani Ichung’wah and Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale

Dr Ruto said he remains committed to the development of the country, irrespective of how people voted in the August 9, 2022 General Election.

“I assure Kenyans that we will never go back to the politics of ethnicity and personalities,” he said in Bungoma County in a speech marking Madaraka Day.

“The 2022 election was defining. It helped clear tribal politics and showed that Kenyan voters make decisions based on issue-based manifestos.”

The warning came on the backdrop of an attempt by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua attempting to rally Mt Kenya region behind him even as he talks of a scheme by individuals close to Dr Ruto to undermine him.

The DP has also revived the one-man, one-vote, one-man one-shilling debate on the sharing of the national cake, claiming Mt Kenya is not getting enough.

It is a stance strongly opposed by those in vast but sparsely populated regions.

It is also on the backdrop of the Limuru III summit that brought together opposition politicians from Mt Kenya, who said Dr Ruto’s administration has not been fair to the region despite overwhelmingly voting him.

The conference was convened by Narc-K leader Martha Karua, Jubilee Party Secretary-General Jeremiah Kioni and a host of other politicians.

Conveners of the summit were accused of running an agenda that could split the country on ethnic lines.

During the National Prayer Breakfast in Nairobi, the President appeared to differ with Mr Gachagua on the one-man one-vote-one shilling, saying every region deserves to be treated like the rest.

Build bridges

“I speak to you leaders as the father figure of the nation that we work together and build bridges as we have a common destiny. There will be no success of one county as against another. We must pull together and succeed together as a nation,” he said.

Mr Gachagua triggered a storm recently by demanding more resources for Mt Kenya counties, citing the region’s huge population.

“I am a believer, a proponent of one-man-one-vote-one-shilling. Resources are about the people. The more you are, the more taxes you pay. The more taxes you pay, the more you should get,” he said.

Gachagua to Ruto: You are the vision carrier of our administration

Last weekend, the DP claimed there is a plot to undermine him as the most senior political figure in Mt Kenya.

Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga then told the President that he risks losing the backing of the region if he isolates Mr Gachagua.

Governor Kahiga added that any attempt to undermine the DP would see the region rally behind Mr Gachagua.

Conciliatory tone

During Saturday’s celebrations, the DP struck a conciliatory tone, telling the President he is fully behind him.

“You are the vision carrier of our administration. Those who serve under you remain committed and focused on assisting you transform our country so that Kenyans have a better life,” he said.

In Kirinyaga, Governor Anne Waiguru told Mt Kenya residents to reject the politics of ethnicity. She said the region cannot go it alone and succeed.

“The people of Mt Kenya are in Kisumu, Mombasa, North Eastern and other parts of the country. We cannot live in isolation. We must be part of Kenya if we want to continue benefiting,” the Kirinyaga governor said at Mutitu Youth Polytechnic.

Ms Waiguru appealed to Mt Kenya residents to work with people from other regions.



“We should work with other Kenyans if we want peace and development. We are in the government because we know how to play good politics free of tribalism. Let us be careful and not buy tribal politics from some of our leaders,” she said.

She told locals to ignore leaders dividing them.

“We can’t achieve anything meaningful by working separately from other regions,” the governor said, adding that ethnic politics is retrogressive and should not be entertained.

“Leaders preaching hatred are doing a disservice to Mt Kenya. To thrive, we need other communities. I will not allow our people to be misled into separating from the rest of Kenyans.”

Inside the mass translocation of herbivores to Lake Jipe Conservancy,"“We are planning a mass capture this time round. Are you interested in covering this?” Liz Gichuki from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) communication team asked me on the phone. I had never heard of such before.

“What does that consist of?” I asked, curiously.

She explained that the KWS team was going to capture a bunch of herbivores en masse and translocate them; and that the exercise would involve a helicopter.

Fast-forward to our arrival at the 28,000-acre Taita Taveta Wildlife Sanctuary, part of the vast Tsavo ecosystem and home to the herbivores that will no longer call this place home. They’ll be moved to the relatively new Lake Jipe Conservancy,  further south, to boost the number of species that exist there.

Re-introductions or introductions of species to a particular habitat are part of regular wildlife management. And when secure space for wildlife is limited due to urbanisation and land use changes, the request for more animals to populate Lake Jipe Conservancy is welcome.

Dr Isaac Lekolool, the head of veterinary and capture services at KWS, explains: “Over the last few years, there has been a huge decline of wildlife numbers. So, whenever we get an opportunity to win space for wildlife, we grab it because such opportunities are rare.”

The mission is to capture and translocate 20 zebras and 20 hartebeests, or kongonis – a large, fawn-coloured antelope. But capturing wild animals is no easy task, and for this particular exercise, the KWS team must build a trap large enough to hold the animals, and one that looks somewhat natural. They first identify an area relatively close to where the animals have been sighted. Using poles and canvas, they skillfully build a funnel-like structure that is wide at one end and gradually gets narrower towards the other end. It’s a job that takes almost two full days to complete.

Help from above is also required for this mission, and that is in the form of a helicopter, which will be used to sight the animals and drive them towards the capture site.

But why not just dart them and load them into the truck?

Campaign Limo, a KWS vet and a professional spotter, explains: “The drugs we use for immobilising animals are imported and very expensive. So, if you can drive them at once, you avoid the cost of drugs, save time and capture the animals at a go. You avoid anaesthesia and the reversal drug for those animals, so you’re just pushing them when they’re conscious, in a comfortable state”.

During any kind of capture and translocation, a high survival rate of the animals is critical, and they must not get too stressed.

The team sets off with the aim of spotting and driving the zebras towards the site first as they are the smarter species compared to the kongonis, and they could present more challenges.

After about 10 minutes, a herd is sighted. But the loud helicopter noise frightens the zebras and they start running away. Captain Koech skillfully maneuvers the chopper to keep up with them. The herd runs towards the bushes. They pick up speed, and so does the helicopter. They turn around and finally, Captain Koech drives them towards the capture site.

But the mission is not yet over. The zebras realise something is not looking right, and they turn around. Captain Koech is not giving up. He maneuvers again, and the zebras run faster. It eventually becomes too challenging to keep the herd together, and they escape. The zebras have outsmarted humans.

Day two.

The team decides to be less ambitious with the animals they target first. The search for the kongonis is on. These antelopes don’t carry a reputation of being very smart.

Soon, a herd is spotted at a distance, from the air, and the herding process begins. Kongonis are one of the fastest antelopes and most enduring runners — capable of reaching speeds of up to 70 kilometres per hour.

This time round it’s more straightforward, and the kongonis run straight into the trap. The partition is quickly closed to block them from escaping.

Now back to the zebras.

The team spots a smaller herd of zebras. With precision, Captain Koech pressures them into the contained space. They know they’ve been trapped and run around, looking for an escape, but they have nowhere to run, except towards the funnel.

The partitions close in on them, but still, they’re determined to find a way out.

It gets dramatic. The team has to chase the herd with sticks. Finally, the last partition is closed.

The zebras walk through the funnel into the truck. It’s a win for the capture team —  six zebras and 12 hartebeests have been captured.

The truck sets off immediately for Lake Jipe Conservancy, as the animals shouldn’t be kept waiting for too long — any male zebra present in the crate could start attacking the females out of aggression.

After a two-hour drive, the animals arrive at the 1,400-acre conservancy, where vegetation and water are abundant. The ecosystem will also benefit from their presence as these herbivores graze on hardened grass that is difficult for other herbivores to digest, making way for tender leaves and grass to grow. They are also expected to boost tourism here.

In 2021, KWS populated the conservancy with 22 zebras, seven wildebeests and two hartebeests. Today, there are almost 300 animals at the conservancy.

 ,"Less than two years into President William Ruto’s first term — and even before he clinches his second term on August 10, 2027 — Mount Kenya region is already rumbling over the 2032 succession. One salient concept driving the Ruto succession rumble in the mountain region is ‘the politics of sympathy’.

Although the idea of sympathy has a pride of place in moral philosophy — traced to Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) — in Kenya, as elsewhere, it has evolved as an ‘irrational’, ‘immature’ and crude “politics of sentiment” rather than the “politics of reason”.

It is opportunistically used by the elite as a strategy to win power at all costs by playing on the grievances, misfortunes, fear and uncertainty of communities. The politics of sympathy play on prejudices and ethnic grievances to produce a ‘victim’ who feels hurt, marginalised, robbed, betrayed or made to suffer. Both sympathy and victim-hood have often led to sentimental collective choices and action.

In Mt Kenya, the sentimental rhetoric of sympathy rests on the premise of ‘shared pains’ across generations. More recently, the politics of sympathy burst into Kenya’s political landscape upon the country’s return to multi-party politics. It thrived on the intense politicisation of ethnic identities that created the binary of ‘victims’ and ‘villains’ as the anvil upon which political coalitions are forged.

Power of sympathy

Historically, the power of sympathy has been the cornerstone of Mt Kenya politics. It shaped the region’s choices of presidents. During the May 18-26, 1963 general elections, which ushered Kenya to independence, the ‘villain’ was the British coloniser. Jomo Kenyatta (1889-1978) was the ‘victim’ of colonialism and hero of liberation.

As a result, Mt Kenya overwhelmingly elected KANU and “Mzee” at almost 75 years. As Prof. Ali Mazrui once quipped, at independence, Kenya was Africa’s youngest nation with Africa’s oldest president. Soon, age become a factor: “The KANU cockerel is too old to crow,” which Kenyatta refuted with a humorous rhetoric and risqué.

Daniel arap Moi also rose to power in 1978 riding on the power of sympathy. He was the victim of the Mt Kenya/’Kiambu mafia’ in the intrigues and power tussles in the Kenyatta succession. Moi’s story is a perfect narrative of the triumph of victimhood and sympathy, eloquently told by Joseph Karīmi & Philip Ochieng' in their best-selling book, The Kenyatta Succession (1980).

Largely attributed to a long and shared hatred of the tyrannical KANU regime, Mwai Kibaki’s electoral victory in 2002 is an exception to the sentimental politics of sympathy. However, Kibaki’s near-fatal road accident at Machakos on December 3, 2002, which nearly killed his dream of becoming president, drew serious sympathy. His re-election in December 2007 was also propelled by the power of sympathy in Mt Kenya fostered by the fear and uncertainty around the opposition’s “one-against-41” campaign narrative.

Undoubtedly, the International Criminal Court’s foray into Kenya triggered intense emotions of sympathy and victimhood, which determined the winners and losers in the March 4, 2013 presidential contest.

Betrayal

Indictment of the ‘Hague Six’ by the Court coupled with “Choices have consequences” rhetoric as well as a conspiracy theory that the court was used to decapitate Raila Odinga’s challengers and whipped sympathy around the Uhuru Kenyatta-William Ruto presidential bid, enabling the duo to win power.

Again, politic of sympathy with the poor (‘hustlers’), betrayal and victimisation by the ‘dynasties’ swept Ruto to power in August 2022.

The road to the 2027 elections is also heavily mined with sentimental politics. The gloves are off. The Ruto-Gachagua tiff is now public knowledge. The gospel tune, ‘Kama Mbaya Mbaya’ (‘If it’s bad, so be it’), by Tanzanian singer, Rose Mhando, has become a war cry in the 2032 succession politics in Mt Kenya.

On May 19, 2024, Nyeri Governor, Mutahi Kahiga, declared that: “We will not allow you to humiliate our son, (Deputy President Rigathi) Gachagua…Kama Mbaya, Mbaya”.

One fiery preacher has prophesied in social media of a new ‘Rigathi sympathy wave’ “gathering from the Mountain might sweep those fighting him”. This has hoisted Gachagua as the new icon of victimhood in Mt Kenya. Three discernible trends are fuelling the new sentimental politics of sympathy in Mt Kenya.

First, is Gachagua’s efforts to win endorsement of the powerful Kenyatta family as heir to Uhuru and the region’s supremo. On March 25, 2024, he extended an Olive branch to the family, apologising to Mama Ngina Kenyatta for insults and ‘disrespectful behaviour’ during the 2022 general election.

Second, the battle for supremacy in Mt Kenya is also playing on the sentimental history of the Mau Mau freedom struggle. In June 2023, Raila dared Gachagua to prove he was truly a “son of Mau Mau”— a badge he brandishes to lay moral claim to Mt Kenya leadership. The answer came in his Wikipedia account: “His parents were Mau Mau freedom fighters in Mt. Kenya Forest where his father serviced guns for the Mau Mau while his mother was a food and ammunition courier for the fighters.”

Mt Kenya kingpin

Third, Gachagua has become assertive, claiming the mantle of Mt Kenya kingpin, calling for the unity of the Mountain around him as the ‘senior-most’ leader. Challenging him is now cast as dividing the region.

The new wave is a real threat to genuine efforts to broker an inclusive change of guard in the still unfinished Uhuru succession. Victimhood is eclipsing reason, community interests and nationalism and denying the region a fair chance of to arrive at a credible alternative leadership to steer the region through the turbulent 21st century.

The gameplan is to unite the vote-rich region around the rhetoric of betrayal, besiegement, marginalisation and economic injustice. In this context, Gachagua is championing the “one man, one shilling, one vote” mantra advocated by the failed Bridging Bridges Initiative in the run-up to the 2022 elections.

Ahead of 2027, the endgame is to scramble and reorganise UDA politics by seizing control of Mt Kenya and eventually present President Ruto with a fait accompli to share power with Gachagua the way he did with Uhuru. But the politics of sympathy and victimhood can degenerate into “Us-versus-Them’ ethnic populism and divide the fragile nation.

 ,"Last week’s state visit by President William Ruto to America was one for the ages. It was a rare honour for a Black African leader by the President of the United States.

Those of us who understand American foreign policy – and especially the treatment of Africa within that milieu – couldn’t mistake the significance of the moment. In regard and global import, Africa has historically ranked at the bottom of US foreign policy. That’s why when an African head of state becomes the centre of attention in Washington D.C. – the world’s most important capital – we must stand up and take notice. Let me peel your eyes on the significance of the visit, and what it means for Kenya and Africa.

President Ruto’s visit to the United States could have come at more fraught time for the West, including the US itself in Africa. In the last decade, Africa has steadily reasserted herself on the global stage as the economies of some of its countries experienced rapid growth. In that span of time, China has been eating America’s lunch in African states where it held historical sway and preeminence, including Kenya.

In West and Central Africa, the French have met with unprecedented revulsion. Once meek countries have told France to get off their backs. Unfortunately, Russian influence is on the ascendance there. But it is in anchor African states such as Kenya where the battle influence is fiercest.

Scramble for Africa

This is the context in which President Ruto visited America. A new Scramble for Africa is underway as emergent powers revolving around China and Russia threaten to upset the post-World War II global order led by America. In imperial parlance, there is the question “who lost” country X? Which American President, or party, was in power when Iran and Vietnam, among others, were lost to the Western orbit? The question among US policymakers might be who will lose Africa to China?

Foreign policy is an extension of a state’s interests and values abroad. It is neither sentimental, nor an act of charity but realpolitik. That is the lens through which we should analyse the visit and the relationship between Kenya and the US.

Importantly, President Ruto’s visit was not just about Kenya. He took on global inequities and how they keep Africa down. He called for real reform of international institutions, especially in finance, to allow Africa full and equitable access in governance and capital. He spoke forcefully against the marginalisation of Africa in global affairs and in peace and security matters. The same attention that is paid to Ukraine and Gaza should be paid to the conflict in Sudan and other distressed African states.

For too long, Africa’s voice has been muted in Washington. I thought President Ruto’s challenge to the US and the West to treat Africa as an equal was timely as Africa surges. President Biden’s re-election would help the reforms President Ruto advanced.

President Barack Obama, an American of Kenyan descent visited Kenya, but his administration did not rain manna on Nairobi from Washington. Donald Trump, his successor, disdained Africa which he referred to as “shithole countries.” But President Biden right off the bat saw Kenya as an important anchor state in Africa. Kenya is one of the countries in which Washington aims to reverse the Chinese “capture” of Kenya. Ambassador Meg Whitman has done yeoman work in bringing Kenya closer to Washington again.

The generous economic, infrastructure, trade, security, education, and cooperation deals that President Ruto signed in Washington are nothing short of impressive. Kenya’s historic designation as a major non-NATO ally is an indirect security pact. It opens many strategic doors.

Haiti mission

At first glance, President Ruto’s visit is an enviable one for any state, let alone an African one. Not only was there pomp and circumstance, but there was also substance. The last African head of state so honoured was in 2008. The whole panoply of American power was on display. To put in military language, it was shock and awe. There’s some criticism out there, especially on the Haiti mission.

That remains a puzzle that President Ruto needs to navigate carefully because Haiti is a tough nut to crack. Other than that, I believe the visit was an unqualified success. As a Black man who lives in America, I was proud to see an African President treated with respect.

If you ask me, methinks Kenya got the better of the visit. Perhaps America is waking up to the fact that it has to treat Africa with respect even as it advances its strategic interests on the continent.

Raila Odinga, a Kenyan statesman, is on the cusp of becoming the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. This feat would make President Ruto’s visit to Washington DC even more significant for Kenya on the global stage. Globally, Kenya’s star is on the rise, even as its local politics remain imperfect. All Kenyans need to see President Ruto’s visit to America as a major win and breakthrough for the country.

 ,"Prof Ngugi Wa Thiong’o wrote a critical text of Kenya’s pivot towards the United States. It is not clear if he actually wrote the said text.

The criticism had a historical basis. It cited historical wrongs visited upon black people by White America. It criticised Kenya’s planned Haiti mission as a “sellout” project. It argued that the Haitians, who bravely overthrew Caucasians during slavery, would be astonished if Kenya were to intervene on behalf of “oppressive” America.

The statement was clearly wrong. Basing foreign policy on emotions and history is never wise. Foreign policy should be based on cold “realpolitik” calculation.

If the text was done by Ngugi — the irony of his criticism while living in the “neo-colonialist” America should stand out.

Enslaved black people

Yes, White America oppressed and enslaved black people, but leadership is about looking forward and planning ahead. Someone rightfully advised in Parliament that “politics is like a motor vehicle that does not have a side mirror; the driver only looks ahead”.

If the brave Haitians who overthrew slavery in the 1700s woke up to how their country turned out 300 years on, they would be embarrassed.

While some subsequent conditions imposed by neo-colonialist France years later impacted Haiti negatively, black Haitians are now in charge.

Haitian presidents like dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier “Baby Doc” should have done a better job. But all they did was to oppress fellow blacks. There is nothing to celebrate about ending slavery when gangs terrorise still poor Haitians today. Neighbouring Dominican Republic is 11 times richer than Haiti.

Leaders of enlightened countries map their foreign policy methodically, often underpinned by economic calculations — not over bygone eras.

Japan, for example, was bombed to oblivion by the US but went on to become America’s greatest ally post-1945. Germany was defeated twice by America in 1919 and 1944 but the US-led Marshall plan benefited the European nation most.

Jews have been oppressed by Europeans for the longest of historical periods but Israel is now underwritten by the West.

What about today’s so-called “special relationship” between US and UK now ? In the 1800s, that relationship was as rocky as the current US-Iran relationship.

It helps poor countries like Kenya to scan around the world for opportunities and ally themselves with strong partners, notwithstanding instances of historical wrongs. It is not really about the country’s dignity but where Kenya’s economic interests might prosper better.

US civil rights leader Malcom X used to describe slavery as spawning two sets of persons — field and house negros. The house negros tended to feel privileged. Therefore, the so-called US imperialism notwithstanding, if Kenya can extract some value out of US superpower status, so be it — let Kenya align with it for it is better to be a favoured house negro than a brutalised field one.

However, there are other opportunities Kenya can miss by openly siding with the West — unless of course US underwrites these costs. Economically, Kenya’s trade with US, except under the African Growth and Opportunity Act arrangement, is not as robust as that with other countries like China. Indeed, Uganda matters more economically to Kenya than the US. Key markets for the agricultural produce that earn Kenya much foreign currency are Europe (horticulture) and the Middle East (tea).

Yes, the US hosts the largest and most prosperous Kenyan diaspora which is a key source of remittances, but as a price for the new US bromance, one key point Kenya should push for is US relaxation of its visa rules.

Remember our bromance with the US also makes us more vulnerable. Kenya will attract US enemies like Al Qaeda who scout for soft targets, but that’s not reason enough to slam the doors to America's strategic rivals — that is their rivalry, not ours.

Take China, for example. Any country ignoring China purposely to make the US happy only makes an unwise foreign policy decision.

China is an economic superpower that Kenya needs. Its leadership in the renewable energy sector, for instance, makes it an indispensable economic partner.

Cheap loans

However, the US has already declared China a rival, meaning that behind the scenes, the US might pull levers against Kenya consuming Chinese tech. But how does Kenya achieve this without logical alternatives?

Regional context also matters. China remains popular and is a source of cheap loans for many struggling African countries. If Kenya requires help from fellow African countries, it cannot afford to appear anti-China.

That is why former Chinese leader Deng Xiaping’s musing made sense when he urged the Asian giant to adopt a nuanced foreign policy of “hide your brightness, cherish obscurity, and bide your time”.

If Kenya were to adopt such middle-of-the road foreign policy, then it can be friends to all international powers.

US President Franklin Rosevelt was said to be “everything to all people”. Kenya must do that — please strategic countries like US and China at the same time.

That way, Kenya gets the best of both worlds since the world is now multipolar. No shop owner ever asks a shopper the source of his/her money. All the shopper does is accept proferred money and trade. Kenya should use this logic to open its doors to all development allies.

Let Kenya be everything to everyone.

 ,"Not a single Kenyan boxer has qualified for the 2024 Olympic Games, pointing to the gradual but steady decline of the sport in the country over the last 60 years.

Kenyan boxers have failed to qualify for the July 26 - August 11 Olympics in three attempts, first at the September 9-23 African qualifiers in Dakar last year, followed by the first World Qualification Tournament in Busto Arsizio, Italy, from March 3-11, followed by the second World Boxing Qualification Tournament in Bangkok from May 24 - June 2.

Heavyweight Peter Abuti’s loss to Poland’s Mateusz Bereznicki in the second World Boxing Qualification Tournament in Bangkok, on Friday, sums up an underwhelming performance by Kenya’s boxing team ‘Hit Squad’ in the Olympic Games qualifiers.

Abuti’s 5-0 points loss to Polish boxer Mateusz Bereznicki in the third and final Olympics qualifier event at the Indoor Huarmark Stadium in Bangkok means all Kenyan boxers have lost their fights in the south East Asian nation and subsequently failed to qualify for the Olympic Games.

Abuti’s defeat follows the elimination of his teammates, bantamweight Amina Martha, welterweight Friza Anyango, middleweight Elizabeth Andiego, light-heavyweight Edwin Okong’o, and light-middle weight Boniface Mogunde, who is Kenya’s deputy captain. Four officials - Boxing Federation of Kenya President Anthony “Jamal” Otieno Ombok, head coach Musa Benjamin who is also BFK’s treasurer, deputy coach David Munuhe who is also BFK’s secretary, and trainer John Waweru who is also the fixtures secretary - travelled with the team to Bangkok.

The ‘Hit Squad,’ which was once a force to reckon with in major competitions like the Africa Boxing Championships, African Games (formerly All-Africa Games), King’s Cup, Commonwealth Games, and World Boxing Championships, has now been reduced to a punching bag, literally.

In 2022, Kenya failed to secure a medal at the Commonwealth Games for the first time since the 2002 Games held in Manchester, England. In contrast, Kenyan boxers had their opponents on their knees at the 1987 African Games, and at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

In 988 when Robert Wangila of Kenya became the first African boxer to win gold medal at the Olympic Games, Kenya had hosted a hugely successful edition of Africa Games a year earlier at the purpose-built Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Mikhail Gorbachev was still the president of the Soviet Union, and Berlin Wall still stood tall between East and West Germany.

Geopolitical tensions

The end of Cold War, the geopolitical tensions between United States of America and Russia and their respective allies, was two years away, and Nelson Mandela had yet to be released from Victor Verster Prison by the apartheid regime in South Africa. Kenya, a one-party state by law, witnessed massive rigging the same year during the General Election held through mlolongo (queuing) system.

Two years earlier, Diego Maradona had led Argentina to victory over West Germany in the 1986 Fifa World Cup held in Mexico, and Mike Tyson had won World Boxing Council heavyweight title for the first time.

Wangila died in 1994 at only 27, but his awe-inspiring performance at the 1988 Olympic Games held in Seoul, South Korea, stands out because for the first time, Kenya won gold medal at the quadrennial games in a sport other that athletics. It was a departure from the country’s tradition of overreliance on athletics for gold medals at the Olympics. Wangila’s gold medal and Chris Sande’s bronze in middleweight accounted for two out of Kenya’s total of nine medals in Seoul.

Waruinge won bronze

But Wangila not the first Kenyan boxer to win a medal at the Olympics.

That honour goes to the late Philip Waruinge who, at the age of 19, represented Kenya at the Olympics for the first time, in Tokyo. Waruinge won bronze at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, and silver at the 1972 Games in Munich, all in featherweight category. Although he lost to the eventual winner Antonio Roldan of Mexico at the 1968 Games, he returned home with the Val Baker Trophy often awarded to the most outstanding boxer at the Games “for demonstration of excellence in the ring.”

Waruinge, who died in October 2022 at the age of 77, was the only Kenyan boxer to have participated in three editions of the Olympic Games. His team mates at the 1972 Olympics, Richard “Dick Tiger’’ Murunga and Sam Mbugua won silver and bronze in welterweight and lightweight categories respectively, and boxing accounted for three medals out of the nine Kenya won at the Games.

It was a golden age for Kenyan boxing during which local pugilist also dominated inter-cities boxing championships contested by boxers from Nairobi, Kampala, and Dar es Salaam.

Murunga, who founded the Kenya Professional Boxing Association, died at the age of 65 in 2018 while undergoing treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital.

Kenya’s boycott of the 1976 and 1980 Olympics disrupted the good performance by her boxers at the Olympics. Kenya boycotted the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Canada, alongside 28 other countries to protest the tour of apartheid-era South Africa by New Zealand’s rugby team All Blacks. Kenya also boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow to protest against the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan.

But Kenyan boxers still showed flashes of brilliance at the next edition of the Olympics held in Los Angeles in 1984 when Ibrahim Bilali won won bronze medal in flyweight category to add to the gold medal that Julius Korir had won in men’s 3,000 metres steeplechase, and Mike Musyoki’s bronze from men’s 10,000m final.

But 36 years since Wangila’s historic performance in Seoul, Kenya’s boxing is on its deathbed.

Performances by boxers Edwin Okong’o and Amina Martha at the March 8 - 23 African Games in Accra might have brought a sense of relief, but the results were inconsequential as far as qualification for the Olympic Games is concerned. It is telling that Kenya National Sports Council, the body mandated with selecting Team Kenya athletes for African Games, only carried four boxers against 52 runners. In Accra, Okong’o gave Kenya her first win in 17 years at the African Games when he beat Moroccan Yassine Elouarz in the middleweight category. Martha got injured in the first round of women’s bantamweight final against Kareem Shukura of Nigeria but still claimed silver medal.

Good performance

Good performance by Kenyan boxers at the African Games came in 1978 (Algiers), 1987 (Nairobi), and in 1995 (Cairo). Kenya led in the medal standings at the games in 1987.

By far, Kenyan boxers registered the best performance in boxing at the 1987 edition of the games held in Nairobi. Kenya collected eight gold medals out of a possible 12. The gold medallists were Maurice Maina (flyweight), Stephen Mwema (featherweight), John Wanjau (Light), Patrick “Mont” Waweru (light welterweight), David “DK” Kamau (welterweight), Robert Wangila (light middleweight), Mohammed “Bodi” Orungi (middleweight), and Chris Odera (super heavyweight).

All the winners qualified for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, where Wangila became the first African to win gold medal at the Olympics via third round technical knock-out against Frenchman Laurent Boudouni. Sande brought home bronze medal in middleweight category. But 36 years later, Kenya will not send a single boxer to the Olympics.

But where did the rain start beating Kenyan boxers?

At the 1985 African Games held in Harare, Kenya won eight medals; two gold, one silver and four bronze. The gold medals came through Peter Odhiambo and Omar “Kassongo” Ahmed.

The ‘Hit Squad’s fortunes plunged significantly in 1991 African Games in Cairo, where Joseph Akhasamba was the only Kenyan boxer to reach the final, eventually settling for silver.

Boxing fans were made to wait for 12 years for a gold medal in boxing, relief coming at the 2003 games in Abuja, where Suleiman Bilali won gold. Bilali again won gold in the 2007 games in Algiers, then the medals drought resumed for two decades until Okong’o won gold in Accra in March.

Due to relatively easy opponents, Africa Olympic Games qualifiers held in Dakar in September last year offered the best chance for Kenyan boxers to qualify for the Olympics, but it .

Christine Ongare (red) of Kenya competes against Priyanka Dhillon (blue) of Canada during the over 45kg-48kg Minimum-weight Quarter-Final match at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.

Kenya is paying the price for poor management of the game locally, lack of clear separation of management and coaching duties at the federation, and lack of meaningful competitions.

BFK chairman, Anthony “Jamal” Ombok who swept to office in 2019 on a platform for change, leads a federation in which elected officials also serve as national team coaches.

BFK’s executive is split on whether or not treasurer Benjamin Musa, secretary general David Munuhe and competition’s secretary John Waweru should continue handling the team as coaches.

Boxing has changed

“The style of coaching has to change. Boxing has changed, and boxers should be allowed to express themselves in the ring. The idea of only relying on knockouts to win bouts as we are doing is outdated. Boxing has changed,” a former international boxer who has now turned professional told Nation Sport. He preferred anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The boxer reckons Kenyan coaches are mismanaging the weight categories by forcing boxers to cut weight drastically so as to compete in weight categories they aren’t familiar with. He reckons national team coaches need refresher courses to stay relevant.

The national team is also seen to be overly dependent on Kenya Police Service and Kenya Defence Forces teams for boxers. The two clubs normally supply more than half of the national team members at any given time.

Musa is adamant that changing the technical bench is not the only solution to the problems facing Kenyan boxing. He is of the opinion that Kenya needs proper investment in training programmes and facilities for boxers.

“I go back to the old adage saying that opportunities only fall to those well prepared. Top boxing nations compete in 20 or so international tournaments in a year and it’s difficult to compete with countries which have invested heavily in preparations and residential training camps that run throughout the year,” explained Musa. BFK Communications Director Duncan Kuria said failure to qualify for the Olympics doesn’t necessarily reflect a drop in the standard of boxing in the country.

Read: The pain of 33-year Olympics medal drought and the promise Tokyo brings

Kuria noted that the quota system International Olympic Committee introduced in continental qualifers that limits each weight category to just one qualifier has not only affected Kenya but also other African countries.

“It means that only seven tickets were up for grabs in the male category, and 11 were in the women’s category in the African qualifiers for the Olympics, which is unfair,” Kuria, explains, adding that 38 fewer boxers will compete in the Paris Olympics compared to the number that competed in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

There were 186 male boxers in Tokyo but only 124 male boxers will be in Paris. Some 33 African boxers (22 men and 11 women) made it to Tokyo, but only 18 (11 women and seven men) will be in Paris. Kuria also pointed out that Cuba, a giant in boxing, has only qualified four boxers for Paris. He defended BFK’s choice of coaches.

“Duplication of roles is only forbidden among referees and judges,” he said. “ In any case, they are the best coaches we have in the country.”

"In Bungoma, Ruto announces more goodies for coffee farmers","Coffee farmers received a major boost on Saturday after President William Ruto announced measures to revive the sub-sector into a profitable investment.

The reforms include a Sh6.9 billion debt write-off for coffee cooperatives and the allocation of a Sh4 billion coffee cherry fund.

The Head of State, who was speaking at the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations held at Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi, Bungoma County, said the reforms are aimed at increasing coffee productivity and enabling farmers to make profits from the investment.

“Measures are underway to boost coffee productivity from 2kg to 10kg per tree and from 50,000 metric tonnes to 102,000 metric tons a year by 2027,” said Dr Ruto, noting that the strategic interventions have led to increased value-addition initiatives.

2024/2025 financial year

He disclosed the payment of Sh2 billion of the Sh4 billion Coffee Cherry Fund, while the Sh2 billion balance will be paid in the 2024/2025 financial year.

The initiatives, he said, will ensure that coffee farmers receive good returns from the measures aimed at transforming the sub-sector into a lucrative investment.

“Our strategic interventions have led to a marked increase in value-addition initiatives. This will ensure farmers get good returns for their investments,” said President Ruto.

To boost the production of sunflowers, some 70 tonnes of seeds were purchased in 2023, with 40 tonnes being distributed to farmers while an additional 40 tonnes of seed were allocated to the Agricultural Development Corporation for seed multiplication.

The government, through the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA), has procured and distributed 500 metric tonnes of seeds worth Sh241 million to farmers in 24 counties.

He disclosed that Sh414 million has been budgeted for the 2024/2025 financial year to boost sunflower production under the National Edibles Oils Promotion Project.

Inside Ruto's bag of goodies for the sugar sector in Bungoma Madaraka Day,"President William Ruto dished out goodies during the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations in Western Kenya, promising to turn around the sugar sector, the backbone of the region's economy.

He revealed that his government had written off Sh110 billion in accumulated debt owed by sugar factories and pumped a further Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through state-owned mills.

The Head of State, who was speaking at Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi, Bungoma County, said the introduction of a new leasing scheme will ensure prompt payment of cane deliveries by farmers.

The scheme, he said, will speed up payment of salaries to factory workers and enable cane farmers to earn bonuses from investment in the crop.

“We are firmly committed to ensuring that the sugar industry returns maximum value to all actors in its value chains beginning with the cane grower. Bonuses to sugar cane farmers will earn bonuses every end of the year, like other crops,” said Dr Ruto.

The sugar sub-sector has remained the backbone of Western Kenya’s economy but is facing mismanagement issues, sparking outcry from cane farmers and workers who go for months without payment.

President Ruto pledged to revive the sector with a Sh2 billion investment into sugarcane development through State-owned mills after the completion of the leasing process.

First tranche

The National Treasury, he said, is to release the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development.

“As part of my commitment to invest Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through State-owned mills, after leasing is completed, I am proud to announce that the government has approved the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development, and the National Treasury shall shortly release these funds,” said President Ruto.

Leaders and farmers from sugar belt regions have criticised the planned privatisation of State-Owned mills, with some of them moving to court to halt the process.

Ruto said his administration was developing a farmers’ and agripreneurs database to improve access and utilisation of information in the agriculture sector to enable farmers to access low-cost farm input and ready market for their produce.

He disclosed that 6.4 million registered farmers captured in the database have accessed subsidised fertiliser from the Fertiliser Subsidy Programme.

"Gachagua: We apologise to Uhuru, never again will we vilify our king","Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said he and Mt Kenya were misled into denigrating their ""king"" - former President Uhuru Kenyatta - adding that the ""mistake should never happen again"".

Last weekend, Mr Gachagua accused ""some Rift Valley politicians close to the President"" of undermining him and the leadership of Mt Kenya.

Read: You are the cause of your problems, Kiunjuri tells DP Rigathi Gachagua

“Come rain come sunshine, we will never again vilify our king. We came here and vilified Uhuru Kenyatta. I repented after that. Did I not repent? Did you forgive me? We will never again vilify the king of the Kikuyu community. Let us teach our youth never again to be used by anyone to vilify our king. Let us love each other so that we get our rightful share of the Kenyan cake,"" Mr Gachagua told a rally at Kimende, Kiambu County, on his way back from an engagement in Kinangop, Nyandarua County.

Mr Gachagua—who had led a lynch mob against Mr Kenyatta and former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta—has taken a reconciliatory tone with the Kenyatta family, and has sworn to unite with the former Head of State in the interest of the populous Mt Kenya.

Mr Kenyatta had backed opposition leader Raila Odinga in the August 2022 presidential election, and President Ruto, Mr Gachagua and their lieutenants had used this to show that as a betrayal of the community, with a series of insults.

Mt Kenya Haki Coalition

A meeting organised by pro-Kenyatta allies early this month endorsed the former president as the leader of a new Mt Kenya Haki Coalition that will “protect and champion the interests of the people of Mt Kenya.”

In the Nyandarua event, a faction of United Democratic Alliance (UDA) elected leaders demanded disciplinary measures against Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja, MP Ndindi Nyoro and other youthful politicians accused of disrespecting Mr Gachagua.

However, the DP yesterday avoided direct involvement in the controversy, instead emphasising the need for unity in the central region and loyalty to Dr Ruto.

“There is a deliberate effort to disunite the Gema community. The community betrayers are still within us, but they can't win. We know their agenda is to be used by the community enemies to finish us. I see darkness, I see people plotting against the community, (and) I can see young leaders hired to divide us. Let us remain united, let’s ignore the betrayers,” Mr Gachagua said, noting that betrayers within the community have historically been used to undermine unity.

Nyandarua Deputy Governor Mwangi Mathara echoed these sentiments, praising the DP’s efforts to unite Mt Kenya residents and warning against political attacks on him.

Kinangop MP Kwenya Thuku said it was a shame for Mt Kenya leaders to disrespect the DP.

“For unity and political discipline, we must respect the DP and the President. We do not want the creation of another Tangatanga, we don’t want to go that route. We ask the DP to convene a meeting of all Central Kenya leaders to discuss unity. The President’s silence on such attacks will be interpreted to mean that the President supports what [Nairobi Governor Johnson] Sakaja and others are doing. These attacks are against DP Rigathi only but the entire community,” he said.

Nandi Senator Kiprotich Cherargei urged those disrespecting the DP to cease, warning that UDA should take disciplinary action against those causing division. “No one will separate the President and his DP,” Mr Cherargei stated.

Disrespect towards him

Kajiado North MP Onesmus Ngogoyo defended Gachagua, stressing that disrespect towards him was unacceptable.

“The DP is a symbol of national unity and must be respected. He was elected the same way the President was elected,” MP Ngogoyo said while his Kajiado South counterpart Samuel Parashina linked disrespect to Gachagua with disrespect to Central Kenya and Maasai communities. He praised the DP’s efforts in fighting alcohol consumption and supported the principle of one man, one vote, one shilling.

Naivasha MP Jane Kihara drew a comparison with Rift Valley’s political culture, where attacking leaders is not tolerated. “We respect and have accepted the DP as our leader. It’s a shame for the Central community to attack their leaders,” Ms Kihara said.

Meanwhile, a political divide has emerged in Rift Valley over the storm kicked up by DP Gachagua’s bare-knuckles attacks on Members of Parliament from the region perceived to be fuelling a falling-out in the UDA.

Youthful MPs are unrelenting in their attack against Mr Gachagua, while some of their senior colleagues and governors have backed the DP. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Emurrua Dikirr MP Johana Ng’eno and Kesses MP Julius Ruto have defended the DP, saying he ought to be respected.

Why WHO wants young people to lead anti-tobacco campaigns,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) wants young people recruited into anti-tobacco campaigns to stop children and the youth from being lured into smoking.

The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) says the young anti-tobacco crusaders will be instrumental in pushing governments to stop predatory tobacco marketing tactics.

Targeting young people is intended to help reduce the growing number of youths who become addicted to cigarettes.

“On World No Tobacco Day, governments are called on to do everything possible to protect current and future generations from the harms of tobacco by implementing the evidence-based measures in the WHO FCTC,” said Andrew Black, team lead at the WHO FCTC secretariat.

According to medical research, there has been a rise in teenage smoking in the past 10 years, even as the number of older smokers has been falling.WHO, in a statement released Friday to mark World No Tobacco Day, said the tobacco industry has long targeted the youth, hoping to create a new wave of “addiction and never-ending profits.”

The Secretariat of the WHO FCTC is supporting WHO’s ""Stop the Lies"" campaign, which seeks to protect young people from being recruited into smoking through means believed to be predatory marketing and promotion of tobacco products.

Very few take up the habit of smoking as adults.

Tobacco companies, however, deny the accusation that they have deliberately targeted young people with tobacco advertising.

“BAT has strict guidelines to prevent sales to underage and research guidelines which mandate that market research is only conducted on adult nicotine consumers,” BAT Kenya said in a statement Friday.

Smokeless nicotine

The Kenyan unit of the UK multinational is calling for sustainable regulation of smokeless nicotine and tobacco products to achieve a smoke-free Kenya.

“To realise the public health potential offered by smokeless products, appropriate regulation is required to encourage adult smokers to switch and protect consumers from inauthentic products with stringent safety standards and prevent underage access and use,” said BAT Kenya.

“Smokeless alternatives to cigarettes, including vapour products and nicotine pouches, are key to supporting the Government’s public health agenda.”

This year’s anti-tobacco day focuses on the youth, with a campaign that provides a platform for young people to push governments to stop predatory tobacco marketing tactics.

“The tobacco industry does this to recruit new tobacco and nicotine users as customers, especially as it needs to replace “customers” who die from tobacco-related diseases,” said WHO.

Sibling behaviour also had a huge influence, with children being four times more likely to smoke if their brothers and sisters did.

The WHO FCTC is an international treaty that binds 183 countries and seeks to stop the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by children and adolescents worldwide.

Anti-Tobacco Day, also known as World No Tobacco Day, is observed as a WHO-led global initiative to raise awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use and to push for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption.

The day is observed to educate the public about the health risks associated with tobacco use, including smoking and smokeless tobacco products.

Gikomba traders should leave vengeance after demolition of their shanties to God,"The hustler government wishes to inform all Kenyans that we have received complaints from a section of the general public asking why our bulldozers are only bringing down buildings in slum areas while those in posh estates living on riparian land are preparing to go to church tomorrow to praise the Lord.

Indeed, when we received this inquiry we had to check with our agents on the ground whether this issue was real, because never in our wildest dreams did we ever imagine that Kenyan hustlers would one day wake up and compare themselves with children of dynasty on anything under the sun.

The hustler government might be blamed for many things, but when it comes to giving hustlers the false sense of belief that they can be anything they want to be, no one can accuse us of reneging on our pre-election promise.

The last time a hustler who eats from the bottom of a city dustbin compared themselves with a government shareholder who drives on the wrong side of the road was during Jesus’ triumphant entry into Capernaum telling those who had gathered around him that blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the Kingdom of heaven.

While the hustler government understands that it is the teachings of the Bible that we used to milk votes from poor hustlers in Kenya in the 2022 elections, we wish to categorically state that we have since brought the Bible down just like you asked us to do, and any hustler still stuck at blackmailing us on how they helped us win elections should know that we were chosen by God.

The Bible says that whoever desires a permanent life of dignity must be ready to undergo a short period of painful trials and tribulations just like God tested Job who refused to abandon his faith for the greater good.

It, therefore, brings us immense disappointment when we see Kenyan hustlers, who are supposed to have read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, cursing the Kenya Kwanza government for putting them through a life of misery from the ongoing demolitions.

Affordable housing plan

The Bible says, in the Book of Mark 10:29-31, that “Mark my words, no one who sacrifices house, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, land – whatever – because of me and the Message will lose out. They’ll get it all back but multiplied many times - and then the bonus of eternal life.”

The hustler government wishes to ask all Kenyans who voted for us to return Kenya back to the body of Christ, whether they gave up on the gospel and went back to sin, because it is not possible that the same Bible they gave us to preach to nonbelievers who were competing with us is now an alien book to them.

We ask these questions sincerely; increasingly concerned by the latest weeping and gnashing of teeth by those who should be defending our government from opposition attacks knowing the journey we have travelled with them together from when they had nothing to now when at least they have structures that can be demolished.

Have the hustlers who voted for us forgotten that the same God who removed them from the streets when they were homeless and gave them shelter in slums is also the same God that can return them to the streets?

Why have you suddenly become ungrateful when God has sent the government to demolish your structures so that we can pay you money to go buy a better house as we wait for the mansions that Jesus went to build for us in heaven?

O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not see the affordable housing plan in the Kenya Kwanza manifesto?

When the Kenya Kwanza team went round the country in 2022 collecting views on how best you would want us to serve you when we assume office, many of you were categorical that they do not want to live in deplorable inhuman conditions along riparian land that were prone to being washed away by floods every rainy season.

Shareholding dreams

You told us that you also wanted to enjoy the life that comes with owning permanent homes in leafy suburbs where you are woken up by a choir of birds as you wait for a government vehicle to check into your drive way to drive you on the wrong side of the road to work every morning.

As you can bear witness, it has taken us less than two years to begin this process of actualizing your government shareholding dreams.

Last year, when we hired Benny Hinn to come help us pray for rain to visit us in Kenya, those who do not believe in God mocked us how we are clueless in running a country – they prophesized failure in our lives and quoted science which says that rain does not come from heaven.

We kept quiet as they laughed at us because just as God did miracles for us in the 2022 elections, so did He not only deliver the highest amount of rain the Kenya Meteorological Department has ever recorded in their recent history, but He also ensured that all hustlers who have ever prayed for an upgrade in their housing conditions had their homes swept away by floods to give the government a perfect opportunity to start the process of relocating them to the leafy suburbs.

Those hustlers who have taken us to court to stop the demolitions must understand that for you to enjoy an air-conditioned house in the leafy suburbs you must first leave your tin roof shack on the banks of Gikomba river and start living like a government shareholder who is ready to own a house in Runda in the name of the Lord.

Clinging to your shanty house – when the government is busy helping Jesus build for you affordable houses – will not only see you lose the privileges that come with an upgrade of your living condition, but will also demonstrate your commitment to abandon the hustler nation for a dry life in the opposition.

You cannot be a believer in the hustler government and take it to court; choose one struggle and let us know soon.

My Madaraka Day thoughts and a belated welcome to Somalia,"Happy Madaraka Day, dear Kenyans! You may remember my reminding you in detail, around this time of year in 2022, of the origins and significance of Madaraka (self-government), Uhuru (freedom, the event) and Jamhuri (republic status) in the process of our liberation from British colonialism.

I was nineteen, getting on for twenty, at the time of these momentous developments, and I remember the rapt joy with which the wananchi received these fruits of their blood, sweat and tears.

Tanganyika and Uganda had attained independence before Kenya, in 1961 and 1962 respectively. But their struggles could not be compared to the bitter and painful campaign of the Kenyan people, part of which was the armed Mau Mau campaign.

The new leaders, heroes on whom the people lavished their adoration and adulation, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, Ramogi Achieng’ Oneko, Paul Ngei, Kungu Karumba, Fred Kubai and Bildad Kaggia, were recently released detainees, from years of trumped-up charges and sheer extrajudicial restriction.

I might have told you somewhere that when I first learnt to read, at the age of eight in 1952, the most eye-catching stories in the nascent Ugandan press were of the Mau Mau struggle, the Emergency and the trial of Jomo Kenyatta and his colleagues at Kapenguria.

Seeing the same men taking over power more than ten years later, when I was a sixth form student of history and public affairs, was quite fascinating. But our interest was not theoretical. Most of Uganda’s manufactured goods came from Kenya, which is also our main route to the sea. Those guys were taking “madaraka” not only for Kenya but also for their neighbours.

This, indeed, brings me to the main thought I wish to share with you this Madaraka Day. “Madaraka”, as I pointed out to you, comes from the action word “kudiriki”, meaning, to be responsible for, to take charge of or to accept an obligation for a situation, an event or a community.

African unity and integration

I propose that Kenya’s Founding Parents, by calling their country’ self-rule “madaraka”, signalled their vision and mission for their country as a responsibility and an obligation to ensure true freedom, prosperity and well-being for everyone. Are we still living up to the ideals?

Another streak that ran strong through those early days of independence was the sentiment of Panafricanism or a continental identity as a fruit of our newly-won freedom. I told you of Mwalimu Nyerere’s tentative offer to delay Tanganyika’s independence if Kenya and Uganda were willing to join the “Trust Territory” (as the colonists called Tanganyika) in an East African Federation.

It did not happen exactly like that, but that was a pointer to the future Jumuiya (EAC). Even in the popular mind, the continental spirit was bubbling, with our musicians crooning about “shirikisho la Afrika” (African Union), and declaiming, “tabu zimeisha, Africa ni yetu” (the troubles are over, Africa is ours).

Did you know that the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the forerunner of today’s African Union, was launched in Addis Ababa on May 25, 1963, exactly a week before Kenya’s first Madaraka Day?

Kenya was, thus, literally born into African unity and integration, and her “madaraka” (responsibility) had, and still has, to transcend its borders. This is not only ideological but also geographical and historical.

Geographically, Kenya is inseparably linked to Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania, with many “cross border” populations.

Think, for example, of the Waswahili, the Wadigo, the Maasai, the Luo and Wakuria on the southern borders, the Baluhya, the Iteso and the Kalenjin on the western borders and the Borana and Somali on the northern and north-eastern borders.

Historically, the colonists had administered Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda as one “East African” unit. We Waswahili, as I call East Africans, knew the advantages of this unity.

That is why the Jumuiya (East African Community) was born, died and, like the famous Son of Man, rose again, and is expanding phenomenally, stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.

Peace in Somalia

Kenya, being at the heart of this wonderful experiment in practical African unity, has to take primary and central responsibility (“madaraka”) in its survival, improvement and smooth operation.

Indeed, Kenyan leaders have done impressively well in this respect, despite the Kenyan people’s recent tendency to be overly inward looking.

Kenya’s recent initiative of “visaless” movement across its territory is an example of taking continental responsibility. Her part in the delicate negotiations of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that led to South Sudan’s independence is another feather in her cap of regional responsibility.

Similarly, Kenya’s role in the search for peace and sane governance in Somalia, at unforgettable national risk and cost, will remain written in golden letters in the history of the region.

Indeed, I think one can say without fear of contradiction that South Sudan’s and Somalia’s joining of the East African Community is primarily due to the crucial role that Kenya has played in orienting those countries towards peace and stability.

I did not welcome Somalia or South Sudan to the Jumuiya with my characteristic effusiveness. This maybe because I already took their joining as a fait accompli. These countries were already strongly in East Africa, and we were in them, mainly through Kenya.

I was in Juba in 2009, during the CPA, helping senior officers polish up their English before they proceeded to academic and professional courses, and there was never a day there when I felt that I was out of East Africa.

Comparably, when my ex-KU student, Dr Adnan Mukhtar Barre, had earlier invited me to Garissa to address some high school audiences, I realised fully how inseparable Kenya and Somalia are.

This is even before we start talking of the many well-established Kenyan Somali communities in nearly all the urban centres of East Africa.

I am yet to visit Mogadishu, but I am sure I would receive the same hospitality as I get in some vintage Eastern Nairobi estates.

Meanwhile, tudirikiane, tafadhali (let us be responsible for one another, please). That is true madaraka.

"Biden details Gaza truce proposal, Hamas responds positively","WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM, May 31 - US President Joe Biden on Friday laid out what he described as a three-phase Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of Israeli hostages, saying ""it's time for this war to end"" and winning a positive initial reaction from Hamas.

The first phase involves a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from ""all populated areas"" of Gaza, some hostages - including the elderly and women - would be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Palestinian civilians could return to their homes in Gaza and 600 trucks a day would bring humanitarian aid into the devastated enclave.

In this phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last ""as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments."" If negotiations took more than six weeks, the temporary ceasefire would extend while they continued.

In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin.

The third phase would include a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the ""final remains"" of hostages to their families.

""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is under election-year pressure to stop the Gaza conflict, now in its eighth month.

Hamas, which Biden said received the proposal from Qatar, released a statement reacting positively.

Hamas said it was ready to engage ""positively and in a constructive manner"" with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces, the reconstruction of Gaza, a return of those displaced, and a ""genuine"" prisoner swap deal if Israel ""clearly announces commitment to such deal"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had authorized his negotiating team to present the deal, ""while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our hostages and the destruction of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities.""

Separately, the Israeli military said its forces have ended operations in north Gaza's Jabalia area after days of intense fighting while probing further into Rafah in south Gaza to target what they say is the last major Hamas redoubt.

The conflict began on Oct. 7 when gunmen led by the Islamist Palestinian group stormed into southern Israel on motorcycles, paragliders and four-wheel drive vehicles, killing 1200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel then invaded the Gaza Strip in what Netanyahu has called an effort to destroy Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that seized control of the area from the Fatah Palestinian faction in a violent struggle in 2007.

Talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and others to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly stalled, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress.

AN INDEFINITE WAR

In his speech, Biden called on the Israeli leadership to resist pressure from those in Israel who were pushing for the war to go on ""indefinitely,"" a group he said included some in the Israeli governing coalition.

""They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" he added.

He implored Israelis not to miss the chance for a ceasefire.

""As the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost,"" he said. ""We can't lose this moment.""

The Gaza war has put Biden in a political bind.

On the one hand, he has long been a staunch supporter of Israel and would like to ensure funding and support from the pro-Israel community in the United States in his Nov. 5 election rematch against Republican former President Donald Trump.

On the other, progressive elements of Biden's Democratic Party have grown increasingly angry at the president for the suffering the conflict has caused civilians in Gaza.

Palestinian health authorities estimate more than 36,280 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel attacked, and the United Nations says over a million people face ""catastrophic"" levels of hunger as famine takes hold in parts of the enclave.

Signalling a U.S. effort to build support for the proposal, the State Department said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Jordanian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts.

Speaking to the Turkish foreign minister, ""he emphasised that Hamas should accept the deal and that every country with a relationship with Hamas should press it to do so without delay,' the State Department said.

In a sign of support for Israel despite the partisan divide in the United States, leaders of the Democratic-led U.S. Senate and of the Republican-led House of Representatives on Friday invited Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress.

The week has been dominated by the fallout from an Israeli air strike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians.

""The Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war,"" Biden said on Friday. ""We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week.""

Bungoma gets a face lift as officials land for Madaraka Day,"Bungoma residents are in a carnival mood as the town warms up to host the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations to be held today at the Masinde Muliro Stadium.

Preparations for the big day have transformed Bungoma town, leaving residents to marvel at the benefits of hosting a national fete.

From Musikoma area, along the Mumias-Bungoma road, the mood is palpable with an improved road network and streetlights that have been erected along the key roads and the town centre.

The scope of road works includes upgrading urban roads to bitumen standard, drainage works and construction of walkways within the town.

The roads within the town have been garlanded with billboards bearing the images of President William Ruto, area Governor Kenneth Lusaka and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula.

Madaraka Day is a national holiday celebrated every June 1 of the year to commemorate when Kenya attained internal self-rule after being a British colony since 1920.

President Ruto will preside over the event that will take place at the newly revamped Masinde Muliro Stadium where more than 10,000 people are expected to attend.

Military officers and the National Youth Service (NYS) raced against time to complete the construction of the stadium.

The team was under the supervision of Interior Principal Secretary Raymond Omollo, who chairs the national holiday celebrations preparations committee.

This week, the team burnt the midnight oil upgrading roads leading to the venue and erecting a perimeter wall around the facility.

For the first time, Bungoma town will have three roundabouts at different points along the Mumias-Kanduyi road with water foundations.

Kenya Power and the State Department for Water are also on the site to ensure existing gaps are sealed and that there is a steady electricity and water connection.

The President has pitched camp in Bungoma for a three-day development tour before presiding over the national fete.

The Head of State landed in the county on May 30 at the newly constructed Matulo Airstrip loaded with a list of transformative initiatives for the region.

Ruto commissioned

On Thursday, the President opened Webuye West Technical and Vocational College at Machakha, before holding a meeting at the Bungoma State Lodge in the evening.

On Friday, Dr Ruto commissioned Mayanya-Sirisia Road and Kapkara dam in Sirisia Constituency. He also commissioned the Immigration office in Bungoma town for passport and other government documents issuance.

The President is operating from the newly revamped State Lodge.

Managers of major hotels in the town have announced full bookings.

Mr Caleb Barasa, the human resource and marketing manager at the Tourist Hotel, said the facility which boasts of two presidential suites, 15 executive rooms and more than 80 standard rooms was at 100 per cent booking.

“Madaraka Day has brought impact in terms of accommodation with an influx of clients seeking accommodation. Some of the clients are from the national government, foreign embassies, the political class and senior county officials,” said Mr Barasa.

“We have been forced to improve our amenities including the restaurants, swimming pool and the club to suit the class of clients checking in. We are also collaborating with the police to beef up security to ensure the safety of our clients,” he added.

Hunters Paradise

And at the Hunters Paradise, accommodation for its 32 rooms was fully booked by May 28.

Hunters Paradise front office manager Diana Apondi confirmed that the facility with one executive, four deluxe suites and 16 standard rooms was filled up.

“The Madaraka Day celebration has given us an eye that we are a potential venue for accommodations,” said Ms Apondi.

Governor Lusaka said the hosting of Madaraka Day celebrations had come with a lot of goodies for the residents of Bungoma that will live long in their hearts.

He said: “Bungoma will not be the same again. The economy of Bungoma will grow tremendously out of hosting Madaraka Day celebrations.”

The government allocated money for the construction of more than 600 kilometres of roads in the county and the refurbishment of Matulo Airstrip ahead of the national fete.

Some of the roads in Bungoma proposed for upgrade for the Madaraka Day celebrations this year are Matulo Airstrip access road, Makutano-River Khalaba (White Rose) Road and Bungoma- River Khalaba (C811) Road, which have been upgraded to bitumen standard.

Mr Lusaka said the construction of the roads under the Kenya National Highway Authority (Kenha), Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) and Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) was meant to open up the region and connect it with neighbouring counties.

Other infrastructure developments in the county include the reinstating of the damaged Malakisi bridge and approach roads, the routine maintenance and spot improvement of Kapsokwony-Kaptama-JCT (A1) and Kitale (B13) roads, Kimaeti-Lwakhakha (B141) road, Mungatsi–Kimaeti (B141) and (Turbo) Junction A1 (Shikhendu) (B123) roads.

Periodic maintenance

Under Kura, 28km of urban roads have been built in Bungoma, Kimilili and Webuye towns.

Kura is also upgrading 13.5km of roads in Bungoma under the annuity programme for Sh4.3 billion, including construction, routine and periodic maintenance.

“The primary intention of the infrastructure development is to support growth in the sectors of commerce, tourism, agriculture, rural production and extractive industries,” said Mr Lusaka during the opening of the Bungoma Food Security Exhibition at Kibabii University.

The county chief said his administration had collaborated with the national government to have all the necessary security arrangements and will continue working on gaps to ensure the safety of all residents and visitors.

Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa said the mood of the Madaraka Day celebration was being felt in Kakamega, as many visitors were spilling to the neighbouring county resulting in a boom in the hospitality sector.

“Kakamega and Bungoma share a lot in common and that is why we (in Kakamega) are feeling part of this celebration. I encourage visitors coming for the Madaraka Day celebrations to sample the different indigenous food and enjoy the hospitality of Kakamega,” he said.

How maize stockpiling in hope for attractive prices backfired,"Cereal farmers in the North Rift region who hoarded their maize worth millions of shillings hoping to get as much as Sh7,200 per 90-kilogramme bag, are staring at heavy losses as returns for the commodity plummet to Sh2,800 following influx of low cost grain that has destabilised market prices.

The poor millionaires who had stockpiled the staple for months in anticipation of better prices are now flocking the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depots, keen to accept the Sh,4,000 per a 90-kilogramme bag offered by the board as the prices nose-dive in the local market.

A 90-kilogramme bag of maize was going at Sh6,800 three months ago with fears that the prices were likely to fall following the arrival of low cost grain from East Africa Community (EAC) member states and the harvest of short season crops including beans and potatoes.

A spot check by the Nation in NCPB depots in the region revealed long ques as the distressed farmers rush to dispose of the produce to cushion them from further losses.

The Eldoret NCPB depot for instance is receiving between 5,000 to 8000 bags of maize daily with farmers expecting to cash in on better prices and prompt payment for the produce.

“We have been experiencing long ques of farmers willing to sell the produce to the board for the past two weeks due to better prices as compared to retail market and prompt payment-24 hours after delivery,” said Gilbert Rotich the NCPB North Rift regional manager.

The government plans to buy a million bags of maize at Sh4,000 per a 90 kilogramme bag through the NCPB for the National Strategic Food Reserve.

“We have so far purchased 592,000 of 50-kilogramme bags of maize but there are long ques of farmers willing to deliver the produce to our buying centres,” said Titus Maiyo, NCPB corporate affairs manager.

Most large scale farmers in the region are in a rush to sell their produce to avoid incurring losses due to the tumbling prices.

“The Sh4,000 per 90-kilogramme of maize is much better as compared to Sh3,000 offered by traders due to price instability caused by the market forces of supply and demand,” said James Songok from Kerita farm, Uasin Gishu County who has more than 1,000 bags of the produce in store.

Read: Food insecurity - Farmers stare at losses as acres of crop destroyed

Most of the large scale farmers were reluctant to deliver the produce to NCPB when it opened its doors late last year due to stringent conditions and anticipation the prices would hit above Sh7,200 per a 90 kilogramme bag.

“The government should allocate more funds to NCPB to mop up maize from farmers and cushion them from losses,” said Joel Maina from Moiben who has more than 500 bags of the grain.

The country realised 44 million bags of maize up from 41 million bags last season due to favorable climatic conditions and distribution of subsidised fertiliser among other factors.

President William Ruto’s administration has pledged to put in place measures that will ensure the country does not import maize by 2025.

Agriculture Principal Secretary Kiprono Ronoh while defending the Sh4,000 per bag offered by NCPB as favourable petitioned farmers with excess maize to sell the produce to the board.

“Farmers should take advantage of the government offer through NCPB to sell and store their produce,” appealed the PS in a past interview.

President Ruto late last year banned importation of wheat and maize produce to protect local market from cheaply imported grain that will destabilise prices.

He halted issuance of new permits to import the cereals noting that his administration will only rescind the decision only in the event the country experiences shortage.

“No permits will be issued to millers to import wheat or maize into the country. This is meant to protect our farmers against price fluctuation in the market,” explained Dr Ruto.

But agriculture and food experts said most millers and traders will be willing to import the commodity due to strengthening of Kenyan shilling against the dollar.

Read: Lessons from Africa’s largest producer of GMO maize

“The exchange rate of the shilling against the dollar is almost stabilising meaning that maize prices will be fair when it is imported into the country,” said John Korir, a trader dealing in import and export of agricultural commodities.

The shilling is exchanging at 130.4 against the dollar that is still hurting the local economy.Interviewed millers said the entry of maize from Tanzania and Uganda has contributed to the lowing the cost of the staple in the local market.

Tanzania is the major exporter of maize and rice to Kenya and other East and countries, including eastern DR Congo, Burundi and South Sudan.

“The maize prices are expected to plummet further due to harvest of short term crops-potatoes, beans among other alternative food crops to maize,” said Joshua Kosgei, an Eldoret based miller.

The millers want the government to harmonise standards for cess and levies across the counties to facilitate steady flow of maize to sustain operations and stabilise prices.

 ,"Since early 2000, Kenya has increased the number of security installations in Lamu County, which has helped make the county safer, boosting the local, national and regional economy, but wrinkles persist on land acquisitions and residents’ access to fishing and other economic activities.

Lamu is rich in military bases.

Apart from the American Manda Magogoni Naval Base, there are camps manned by Kenyan military in places like Bar'goni, Baure, Milimani, Mkunumbi, Bodhei, Saurian, Mararani, Mangai, Kiunga among others.

Residents have since benefited from the security installations, especially in Manda Bay, which has led to increased investment in both the public and private sectors.

The development of Lamu Port, various Lamu Ports South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor (Lapsset) projects and private individuals have benefited from the security provided by the Lamu-based security officers.

Recent developments indicate that Kenya is making progress in securing its ports and maritime space.

As a result, the International Maritime Organisation has removed the country as a high-risk area due to its success in tackling the challenges of piracy.

The American Manda airfield, which supports Kenya in various operations in the country and sub-Saharan Africa, played a key role in the capture of Kismayu by the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) in September 2012.

According to locals, the presence of US military at the Naval Base in Magogoni, Manda Bay Island, Lamu County is critical to the region’s peace and stability.

The base is located in part of the expansive Boni Forest, where Operation Amani Boni aimed at flushing out al-Shabaab militants believed to be hiding in the dense forest, has been ongoing since 2015.

The KDF has a base next to the American naval base, and has been complementing each other in the operation.

Community members, especially elders interviewed by the Nation on Friday, commended the State for establishing such an important facility in Lamu.

Ali Kea, an elder of Magogoni village, about 400 metres from the Kenyan and American military bases, said the community will continue to cooperate with security agencies to ensure continued peace and stability in Lamu.

""We are happy as a community that the military bases are in Manda Bay Island. We will cooperate and support all the government's security efforts for the betterment of Lamu and Kenya,"" Mr Kea said.

""In recent years, Lamu has been peaceful, thanks to the ongoing Operation Amani Boni and the simultaneous presence of the Manda Bay military bases. It has protected the community from external attacks.""

But as military bases continue to occupy more of Lamu and part of Tana River counties, the National Land Commission's recent plan to acquire 5,000 acres has not gone down well with locals.

The community says they should be well compensated as the vast land is used for grazing and farming.

""In October 2021, the government in a gazette notice announced its intention to acquire more than 5,000 acres in Lamu and Tana River counties to expand the base. What we are demanding is that we should be well compensated to start other businesses as it will affect our economic lives,"" said Aden Bule.

The Manda base, which operates as a KDF Forward Operations Base (FOB), was established in 1992 and officially inaugurated in 1995 to provide logistical support to Kenyan military units stationed in Northern Kenya and Kismayu.

Over the years, the Kenyan base has grown to include an all-weather airstrip with night landing capability and a 1.3 kilometre runway.

US and Kenya last week, during President William Ruto State visit, agreed to lengthen the runway in the American base.

“Underscoring our shared commitment in the fight against terrorism, US and Kenyan officials plan to sign a memorandum of understanding to expand the Manda Bay Airfield in coastal Kenya by building a 10,000-foot runway. The expanded facility provides Kenya the required infrastructure to increase operations against the terrorist group al-Shabaab,” a White House communication said.

Government Spokesman Isaac Mwaura on Friday quantified the security deals Kenya inked — including helicopters, armoured vehicles and other support — from the US trip at Sh130 billion.

“Kenya secured over Sh 130 billion in joint efforts to improve regional security, combat terrorism, and enhance border security; as well as support for Kenyan security forces through training and equipment,” he said.

It is worth noting that for over a decade, Lamu has been battling insecurity incidents caused by al-Shabaab militants from neighbouring Somalia.

This has led to the death of scores of security personnel and civilians.

The worst Shabaab attack in Lamu is that of June 15, 2014 in Mpeketoni and Kibaoni towns, that left more than 90 people dead, over 30 houses and 40 vehicles burnt in one night alone.

Subsequent attacks also occurred in Witu, Hindi and Boni Forest villages.

The situation prompted the national government to launch a multi-agency security operation dubbed 'Linda Boni' in September 2015 to flush out the terrorists believed to be hiding in the dense Boni Forest.

The operation has undergone several transformations from Linda Boni, Boni Enclave Campaign, Operation Fagia Msitu, and now Operation Amani Boni.

It comprises the KDF, National Police Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service and National Government Administration Officers with KDF as the lead agency.

"With droughts ravaging cattle, Kajiado embraces fish farming","The net catches different sizes of tilapia. The fishermen identify the mature ones and place them in a container of clean cold water before releasing the rest back to the pond.

This is Imutaitin village in Kajiado Central sub-county.

Judith Kuntai, who practices fish pond farming, has also mastered the skill of removing scales and intestines of the tilapia before distributing to customers.

She keeps some for her household.

“When in school, I was told to transform society. I ventured into farming because of its economic significance,” the primary school deputy headteacher says.

The pond occupies a quarter-hectare, with two fences around it.

The project started by Kuntai in 2021 has survived the longest drought witnessed in Kajiado.

“Our borehole dried. It was very expensive to maintain the right volume of water in the pond at the time,” the mother of three says.

El Nino rains from November 2023 to May this year were a relief for Kuntai.

“I have not spent money on water from the time it began raining. Evaporation is less after temperatures fell. My maize and vegetables are also thriving,” she says.

The teacher encourages her community to embrace fish farming and rainwater harvesting. She belongs to three women groups.

“The heavy rains have boosted our fish production. Our dam is full of water that will be used during dry spells. We harvested rainwater in several tanks,” Kuntai says.

There is increased demand for protein as population grows. With global warming, scientists say fish pond farming will help fight hunger.

Kuntai appreciates the ripple effects of fish farming in dry Kajiado County.

“Many of our cows, goats and sheep die as we move them during droughts. There are also quarrels when animals move from one homestead to another. We’ve overcome these challenges with fish farming,” she says.

Isaac Samperu is another fish pond farmer in Matapato South ward. The father to three got into the venture after realising he could turn a reservoir he had been using into a pond.

“During drought, crop and animal production was tough as farmers competed for water. The fish pond and vegetables also needed water. The heavy rains came as a blessing,” he says.

“The circulation of water has improved too. The water that I pump into the farm from the pond contains nitrogen, phosphorus and other minerals important for my crops.”

Shortly after the fish are fed, they produce waste. The fish also do not eat all the feed given to them.

The remains stay in water, which is recycled through irrigation.

Samperu is happy to contribute to the war on hunger in Kajiado County.

“I get money from this enterprise and the fish is used as food by the community,” says the Multimedia University of Kenya alumnae who holds an Advanced Diploma in Management Information Systems.

Samperu’s tilapia pond is 20 by 10 metres and has more than 1,000 fingerlings. At least 200 adult fish are mature enough to be harvested.

He harvests tilapia two times a year and hopes to build another pond soon.

“My biggest problem is getting feed. Nairobi is very far but that is the only place I get good feed. A 25kg bag is Sh3800,” he says.

Japhet Kaadzo Tembo, an aquaculture expert, says the quality of feed affects the growth duration and size of fish.

“Fish should mature in there to four months after hatching. Because getting the right feed and protein is a challenge, the period in many farms extends to six to seven months.

“You must feed your fish well and create the right conditions for them to grow,” Tembo says.

Families displaced by the Boko Haram conflict in Nigeria have resorted to fish pond farming.

“Northeastern Nigeria is on the fringes of Sahara Desert where it rains for 90 days a year. The most important thing there is to have a reliable source of water in a secure location,” says Jasper Mwesigwa, head of the FAO Nigeria Food Security Analysis Unit.

 ,"A series of statements disowning an announcement by United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary General Cleophas Malala has exposed the rabble-rousing politician as a man under siege.

Informally, some party officials say he is a marked man and could be on his way out of his swanky office at the Hustler Plaza on Ngong Road, which he has occupied for just a year and two months.

Mr Malala – a one-time Member of County Assembly and former Kakamega Senator – has been having long-running trouble with some influential UDA members, but the dramatic events of Thursday could be a pointer that he has lost favour with the owners of the party.

This came days after his warnings about utterances supposedly dividing the party was met with strong reactions.

The politician with razor-sharp tongue was brought in UDA by President Ruto in March 2023 from Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress (ANC), on whose ticket he unsuccessfully contested for Kakamega governorship.

Even at his former party of ANC, Mr Malala had a troubled stay with party officials. He survived expulsion on the basis of a long and winding legal process after falling out with Mr Mudavadi.

He is always courting controversies just like in his other life of writing and directing plays.

When he joined UDA, Mr Malala hit the ground running with lofty ideas of a one-party dream for President Ruto with August deadlines to boot.

He also demanded to be co-opted in the Cabinet the same way former Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju was. He got a flag to fly. The flag comes with privileges like evading traffic jams.

But his entry rattled some of the Kenya Kwanza affiliate partners, especially the ANC and Ford Kenya of National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula, as he became pushy in calling for their folding. He went to the extent of calling them village political parties.

“I resigned from ANC because I wanted to show my ANC people the way. I wanted to show them leadership. Like John the Baptist, I came to prepare the way for them. They will eventually come to this merger and know that they can be easily accommodated. I resigned to join the UDA to give ANC the confidence that having one strong party is not a bad idea,” he told Nation in a previous interview.

But things have taken a dramatic twist for the man at the ruling party. On Thursday night, a frustrated Malala shared a video lamenting how he had lost control of the UDA official Facebook page.

He claimed the account had been hacked by an individual who is not a member of the UDA secretariat.

This was after his statement purporting to postpone West Pokot constituency elections was roundly dismissed by other party officials, who, ordinarily, would be answerable to him as the party spokesperson.

Sources at the party told the Saturday Nation that administrators of the Facebook page, who are allied to him, were last night stripped of their roles following an order from “above.”

This assertion was confirmed by Communication Strategist at State House Dennis Itumbi, who dismissed the hacking claims.

“The UDA pages are safe across social media, ignore anyone saying anything to the contrary. On Matters UDA elections, ignore Malala. Only the National Elections Board can issue statements on the election,” said Mr Itumbi, who is close to Dr Ruto.

The embattled party secretary general did not respond to our queries over his troubles at the party. Mr Malala on Thursday evening caused confusion in the party when he purportedly postponed the ongoing party elections in West Pokot.

“In adherence to the UDA Party constitution and to respect the integrity of the party's organs, we hereby postpone the planned constituency elections in the affected constituencies to a later date that will be communicated by the National Elections Board,” said Mr Malala.

But this position was roundly dismissed by UDA National Elections Board (NEB) chair Anthony Mwaura, the party’s Electoral and Nomination Disputes Resolution Committee (ENDRC) vice chairperson Adrian Kamotho and UDA executive director Nicodemous Bore.

“Reference is made to a notice by the acting secretary general purporting to postpone the ongoing elections in West Pokot County. Article 21 of the UDA constitution establishes the National Elections Board as an independent organ of the party that must act independent of any direction from anybody or any party organ,” said Mr Mwaura.

“Resultantly, any notice purporting to address election matters is unlawful, without basis and is, therefore, null and void. The UDA party will carry on with all the constituency level elections scheduled to take place tomorrow, 31/5/2024, in compliance with the earlier notice.”

Dr Kamotho also dismissed the ruling that Mr Malala relied on postponing the elections as fake, adding it did not emanate from the committee.

“Our attention is drawn to a public notice issued by the acting secretary general of the UDA party purporting to reference an order of the Electoral and Nomination Disputes Resolution Committee. The referenced order is FAKE and the same did not emanate from the ENDRC,” said Dr Kamotho.

Trouble started when some UDA leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Boni Khalwale and Didmus Barasa (Kimilili MP), accused him of trying to interfere in the party elections.

Senator Khalwale had petitioned the party to restrain Mr Malala from discharging the mandate of his office because of his interests.

Mr Barasa told the Saturday Nation that Mr Malala has been operating like a gun for hire in the party. He described him as an inexperienced politician who cannot lead a ruling outfit.

“Because he has positioned himself as a gun for hire, we will mobilise party members to kick him out of the party,” said Mr Barasa.

On Wednesday, when he triggered yet another storm by reprimanding politicians perceived to be attacking Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, Mr Malala was roundly attacked by a section of UDA politicians, some demanding his resignation.

“Ag SG Malala in UDA is like a square peg in a round hole. He doesn't fit. I have said it before and I repeat. We must get rid of him in the coming UDA elections,” said Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga.

“We have come from an era of being gagged and threatened for speaking our minds. UDA was never built on such tenets and the earlier our ANC acting SG in UDA understood that, the better for him,” added the county boss.

An alleged Sh200 million price for the procurement of election tablets is also said to have caused boardroom wars at the party.

Dr Ruto is said to have stopped the procurement of 10,000 election tablets at a price of Sh200 million.

Some top party officials are said to have settled on a local supplier, who quoted $150 (Sh20,250) per unit.

The figure was estimated at Sh25,000 based on the exchange rate at that time, inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT), according to officials.

In a previous interview with Nation, Mr Malala admitted that the initial supplier had quoted Sh25,000 per unit. Mr Malala said Dr Ruto himself later sourced the tablets from China at $75 (Sh10,125), a half of the initial quotation.

“In Kenya, the tablets cost Sh25,000 per piece. When we scouted for the tablets, we thought we could get them locally, but suppliers made a quotation of about Sh22,000. It was coming to Sh25,000 when you include VAT. It was too expensive,” Mr Malala said.

“The boss (President) procured directly from a manufacturer in China. It was procured at $75 (Sh10,125),” he said.

 ,"“It is a Sunday. I am nine. We are sitting on a patch of some tough nylon grass next to the veranda. Mum has brought out her Ugandan mats. I am reading a new book. I am reading a new book every day now. This book is about a flamingo woman; she is a secretary, her stick-like legs improbable in cloggy high heels, her handbag in her beak. Flying away. The flamingo book came with a carton of books my mum bought from American missionary neighbours who were going back home.

""The sun is hot. I close my eyes and let the sun shine on my eyelids. Red tongues and beasts flutter, aureoles of red and burning blue. If I turn back to my book, the letters jumble for a moment, then they disappear into my head, and word-made flamingos are talking and wearing high heels, and I can run barefoot across China, and no beast can suck me in, for I can run and jump farther than they can. On my trampoline of letters and words,” so wrote the late Binyavanga Wainaina in his book, One Day I Will Write About This Place.

May 21, 2024 marked 5 years since the 2019 death of Binyavanga Wainaina and this is a good time to reflect on the legacy of one of Kenya’s most revolutionary writers.

He was as restless as the words he wrote: always flying away like the “Flamingo woman” in his book. Literature is about flights of fancy. Binyavanga understood this.

Leo Tolstoy said that there are only two plots in all of literature: a person goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town.

Diana Gabaldon, the American fiction and fantasy writer captured aptly the root of flights of fancy when she wrote in her famed Outlander series book 1 that, “People disappear all the time. Ask any policeman. Better yet, ask a journalist. Disappearances are bread-and-butter to journalists. Young girls run away from home. Young children stray from their parents and are never seen again. Housewives reach the end of their tether and take the grocery money and a taxi to the station. International financiers change their names and vanish into the smoke of imported cigars”.

Binyavanga probably wanted to find out what it was like to vanish into the smoke of imported cigars. His curiosity always probed other places and other people. To go elsewhere even if it was through imagination.

Read: Binyavanga was controversial, but Kenya owes him tribute

He summed this fittingly in One Day I Will Write About This Place when he wrote that, “What a wonderful thing, I think, if it was possible to spend my life inhabiting the shapes and sounds and patterns of other people”. And he also fancied following other roads other than the one he was on. Once, he heard Maasai morans (warriors) sing and he imagined what it would be like following them, “…traveling around, to avoid my parents, to follow a road and think about things other than what is wrong with my life”.

He always imagined himself on another road in another life in another place.

However, Binyavanga could also write about the mundane — transforming it into something of wonder. He writes about flamingos, “I look up to watch the flamingos rise up from the lake, like leaves in the wind... The wind swoops down, God breathes, and across the lake a million flamingos rise…”.

He paints a picture so clear that the reader doesn’t have a difficult time conjuring up the scenes — the words bouncing gently up and down, in an almost piercing rhythmic squeak.

He was also a poet of the city. He wrote in One Day I Will Write About This Place that, “We drove to Nairobi today, my father and I, to the city. I have five pimples. The capital city, for me, is the opportunity to spend time on soft teenage hydraulics — bookshops and burgers and Right On magazine and soft-cheeked girls who say ‘That’s fantabulous!’”

He captures Nakuru as well as he does Nairobi. Like a poet of unrequited love. He can capture late mornings as easy as he does long, lazy afternoons.

He can capture that distant silhouette of a Nairobian like a leper without a home — lonely and hungry, sitting at Uhuru Park as people walk by and, from a distance, Nairobi looking metallic, brusque and impervious like a brutal master.

The stench of business hanging heavy in the air — everything costs money and one has to be constantly on the lookout for conmen, scammers, thieves, money-hounds and other wannabes.

Dangerous place. Newcomers always felt small and shrunken, muffled by the vastness of the city. Or bleary-eyed, tears streaming down as one walks in a shambling gait down the street, trailed by foggy air.

That’s Binyavanga territory. And he also captured the smouldering wreckage of Kenya. Like that fateful afternoon in 1982 after the failed coup attempt.

Binyavanga wrote, “In the afternoon, the coup is put down, and thousands are killed. Nairobi has corpses everywhere”.

Kenya haunted Binyavanga, tormenting him like an abusive lover — but there were always echoes of nostalgia in his works for his motherland.

Rest easy, Binya. You flew far, far away. It’s been five years already, yet have we not forgotten thee. Death, be not proud.

Fashion footprint: How clothes are destroying planet – and the way forward,"Fashion, a multi-billion dollar industry that thrives on creativity and personal expression, casts a long shadow on the environment. While we enjoy the latest trends, the processes behind production and disposal contribute significantly to climate change.

Many popular fabrics, like synthetic polyester, are derived from fossil fuels. Their production requires vast amounts of energy, releasing harmful greenhouse gases. Additionally, textiles' dyeing and finishing processes often rely heavily on water and chemicals, leading to water pollution.

A major polluter, the fashion industry is responsible for an estimated eight to 10 per cent of global carbon emissions annually, according to a 2022 report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. That is more than international flights and maritime shipping combined.

Fast fashion, a business model based on churning trendy clothes at high volume and low prices, exacerbates these problems. Clothing is often cheaply made and quickly discarded, leading to mountains of textile waste, with truckloads of clothing ending up in landfills or being incinerated every other second.

The burden of this waste disposal, however, is not equally shared. Developed nations, often the largest producers of textile waste, frequently export their used clothing to developing countries in the global south. These countries, lacking the proper infrastructure and resources for responsible waste management, often dump clothes in landfills or burn them in open pits.

This practice pollutes the environment and poses significant health risks to local communities. A 2021 report by Greenpeace highlighted the issue of micro-plastics shed from synthetic garments polluting waterways and entering the food chain.

A recent investigation in Ghana, a major destination for used clothing from the West, exposed the devastating impact. Mountains of discarded clothing choke the environment, while local tailors struggle to compete with the influx of cheap, used garments.

The urgency for change within the fashion industry is undeniable. The path toward a more sustainable fashion future requires collaboration between consumers and the industry. Consumers can drive positive change by making informed choices, embracing mindful consumption habits and supporting ethical brands. Similarly, the fashion industry must prioritise sustainability throughout its supply chain, from sourcing materials to garment disposal.

Our responsibility as consumers

As consumers, we can drive positive change by making informed choices. Embracing quality over quantity is vital. Investing in well-made, timeless pieces ensures longevity. Opting for natural fabrics like organic cotton or linen, which have a lower environmental footprint than synthetic options, further supports sustainability. Shopping second-hand extends the life cycle of clothing and reduces demand for new garments. Additionally, learning proper washing and storage practices can significantly prolong the lifespan of our clothes. Supporting sustainable brands committed to ethical production and utilising recycled materials is also crucial.

The fashion industry's role

The industry itself needs to embrace a paradigm shift. Sustainable sourcing such as using recycled materials and organic fibers can significantly reduce the industry's environmental footprint. Adopting circular fashion models, where old garments are collected, recycled and turned into new clothes, minimises waste. Transparency in the supply chain is essential as consumers have the right to know where their clothes are made and under what conditions, enabling accountability for environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, the industry must invest in innovation, focusing on research and development to create more sustainable and eco-friendly materials and production processes.

Luckily, there are a growing number of sustainable alternatives available. With a shift in consumer choices and industry practices, we can transform the fashion industry into a force for good by using several known options.

Natural fibers like organic cotton, linen, hemp, or Tencel, derived from wood pulp offer a more sustainable alternative. These materials are generally grown with fewer pesticides and require less energy.

Recycled polyester, created from plastic bottles or discarded clothing, gives existing materials a second life and reduces reliance on virgin resources.

New sustainable fabrics are emerging such as those made from bamboo or algae. These options often require less water and land to cultivate and boast faster biodegradation rates.

"Waivers, VIP culture and impunity","The imperatives of law and order are indispensable components of every society's political sustainability.

This is because by definition, the idea of society itself arises whenever human existence ceases to be a solitary affair.

Society implies others, which is the foundation of the political, that interface of the private with the common, and the intersection of individual and public interests.

In other words, if two or more persons are to subsist without running the risk of violent mutual decimation, a modus vivendi dedicated to mitigating conflict, conducing individual felicity and facilitating collective efficiency, is absolutely unavoidable.

Howsoever articulated, the dos and don’ts of human coexistence are vital institutions that obligate all in order to propitiate all.

Thus, to be effective, society's institutions must draw their legitimacy from mandatory universal application in the sense that they bind all eligible persons without discrimination.

Irrational exemptions

Owing to the foregoing, the practice of maintaining irrational exemptions from compliance, explicit or otherwise, essentially constitutes direct sabotage of the political community, and a fundamental ingredient of pernicious impunity and intractable disorder.

An exemption is irrational when its beneficiary’s exceptional capabilities to meet or exceed the eligibility criteria for compliance are either ignored or perversely leveraged to create privilege, with the consequence that those who should find no trouble complying are granted the carte blanche not only to evade compliance, but often, to openly and publicly violate the rule in other ways.

The nation’s universal disgust upon learning that two banks — organisations reflexively associated with the phenomenon of ‘super-profits', which thrive regardless of ambient economic vicissitudes — had sought, and been granted, exemption from paying taxes due as a consequence of their merger, indicated our political community's visceral revulsion in the face of a spectacularly public instance of antisocial behaviour by the highly privileged.

Public outrage was further intensified by the fact that at material times, the ownership of the entities was linked to a serving top public official, who is the scion of a wealthy and privileged clan.

On a similar register in terms of potential to incite hearty public disapprobation is the incorrigibly delinquent penchant by VIPs, or senior elites in our public sector who, upon elevation acquire a sudden and intense appetite for impunity, to wantonly disregard the mores of harmonious coexistence, peace and order, and to flagrantly violate normal expectations of personal responsibility, public accountability and obedience to the rule of law.

Violate basic rules

What else accounts for the open indifference by our elites to such elementary norms as the Highway Code?

What accounts for the impunity with which they visibly, actively, loudly and publicly violate basic rules in the full view of fellow citizens, who are not patiently submitting to the same rules at immense cost and inconvenience, but are also horribly prejudiced by the reckless and inconsiderate rampages of their betters?

In every community, rules are invariably made by the elite, be they divinely mandated autocrats or sovereign representatives, in conjunction with their political associates and accomplices.

It may be assumed that these elites perceive some advantage in promulgating various edicts, and that they perceive themselves as agents acting within, not outside the political community, for whom the feasibility and desirability of compliance matters.

This is to say that, unlike the regimes of colonial and slave political economies — whose institutions were designed for the explicit purpose of expropriating and enslaving one segment of the political community for the benefit of another — it is reasonable to assume that when our elites make rules, they expect to be bound by them and intend to submit to them.

Representative democracy implies that our leaders shall make rules in our name, and therefore, shall make only those rules whose universal enforcement enhances our collective interests.

Elite delinquency

To make rules and subsequently devise arrangements for the most capable among us to disobey them, fundamentally contradicts the purpose of government.

First, elite delinquency is the most flagrant advertisement of a prevalent catastrophic failure of representation: the divergence between the needs of the people and the interests of their leaders underscores a fundamental conflict about the nature and purpose of the political relationship.

Secondly, and related to this, elite effort to evade compliance calls into question the fairness of the rules they make.

Far from enhancing prestige and eliciting admiration, VIP culture — the shock-and-awe exhibitions of material and behavioural signals of privilege, accessories of power and accoutrements of status, including the juvenile insistence on jumping queues or being driven on the wrong lane at peak traffic hours, entitlement to irregular facilitations to access rewards and benefits otherwise exclusively reserved for the deserving best and brightest, and other refractory conduct — severely undermine endeavours to develop coherent institutions and build a strong state.

More than anyone else, our elites should recognise the benefit of our institutions, and take the lead in personally complying, and ensuring that everyone else complies with them.

The fact that they see delinquency as prestigious is a horrifying moral tragedy which confirms our worst fears: state failure is an inside job.

Nyadhi Festival set for at Carnivore grounds,"For Rhumba fans in Nairobi, next Saturday it will be an opportunity to team up with Johnny Junior and BV Band who will be the highlight during the inaugural Nyadhi Festival to be held at the Carnivore Restaurant in Nairobi.

According to the organisers of the event the show is set to also celebrate the 15th anniversary since the formation of Johnny Junior's BV Band. For fans of the band, it will be an opportunity to come together to celebrate music and culture dancing to the various compositions of the group.

Others expected at the show include Ohangla star Emma Jalamo, Nadia Mukami, Coster Ojwang, Nyasanje, Kidum, It’s Yaba and MC Pengle. Jalamo has popular tracks like Utanikumbuka and Amilo Nyar Nyakach. While Yaba has tracks like Jatelo and Sherehe. Nadia Mukami has songs like Mali Safi and Kai Wangu while Kidum is still doing well with tracks like Haturudi Nyuma and Mapenzi.

In the recent past, Junior and his group have been engaged in a campaign build-up to the festival during shows. Last Saturday they performed during the Wangawana Saturdays Show that was held at the Pyasa Lounge - Mihang’o in Utawala, Nairobi.

The group also regularly performs at other spots in and outside Nairobi. Junior formed the BV Band after leaving Musa Juma’s Limpopo International Band. Notably, the group featured rhumba beats blended with Luo ballads. Earlier, it was the legendary Ochieng Kabaselleh who was in the forefront of incorporating Lingala lyrics, Luo and rhumba beats. Johnny Junior has since excelled as one of the proponents of using rhumba beats in his recordings.

Some of Johnny's popular songs include Vinny, Mashabiki, Ösiepe, Nyaremo and Ämour Special. Entrance fees for the show will be Sh2,000 (regular), Sh5,000 ( VIP) and Sh10,000 ( VVIP). Tickets for the show are available through www.tikiti.co.ke

Explainer: What happens next in South Africa after ANC loses majority?,"For the first time in South Africa's democratic era, the African National Congress (ANC) will have to seek a coalition partner to govern with after it was on course to fall well short of a majority in the national election.

Here are scenarios of what could happen next in South Africa and which parties the ANC might partner with:

Will Ramaphosa get ousted?

With results in from over 60 per cent of polling stations, the ANC had just under 42 per cent of votes, by far its worst result since democratic elections began after the end of apartheid in 1994 and leaving it short of a majority in parliament.

Some political analysts say this could lead to party leader and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa having to step down.

Over the past four electoral cycles the ANC's share of the vote gradually dropped, but never by more than five percentage points from one election to the next.

If the vote share of 42 per cent or below is confirmed, the party could seek to oust Ramaphosa as its leader and nominate another high-profile politician such as Deputy President Paul Mashatile or Gwede Mantashe, currently in charge of the mines and energy ministry, to the National Assembly to elect as South African president.

A more probable scenario could see Ramaphosa carry on for a while to broker a coalition deal with another party in a bid to secure a parliamentary majority and then hand over to a successor, analysts say.

Asked on Friday whether Ramaphosa would have to resign after the dismal election result, ANC First Deputy Secretary-General Nomvula Mokonyane said: ""Nobody is going to resign.""

In any case, the ANC needs to move quickly as the constitution says the new National Assembly must convene within 14 days of the election results being declared, which is due to happen on Sunday, to elect a new president.

Who are the potential coalition partners?

Depending on the final numbers, the ANC may have no choice but to seek support from one of its larger rivals: the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, or the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).

The price of a deal with either of those would likely be significant policy concessions by the ANC, as well as the offer of some senior government positions for their partner.

Analysts say it is difficult to envisage a stable arrangement under this scenario, and South Africa could be facing a period of unprecedented government volatility.

Investors and the business community would prefer a deal with the DA, which has received 23 per cent of votes counted so far, and is seen as more market-friendly.

However, many analysts think the ideological divide between the ANC and the leading opposition party is so wide as to make such a deal difficult, if not impossible.

Led by Julius Malema, a former leader of the ANC's youth wing, the EFF may be a more natural fit for the ANC, but relations are tense between Malema and some ANC factions.

The EFF, on 9.5 per cent of the vote, said in April it would partner with the ANC if it got the powerful post of finance minister.

The ANC, which has not disclosed its thinking on any non-majority scenario, would be unlikely to agree to this unless it were hugely weakened.

Steven Friedman, an academic affiliated with the University of Johannesburg and Rhodes University, said it was hard to imagine the ANC and the EFF governing together for five years.

He cited their inability last year to agree on a constitutional change on land reform even though their positions on the issue are closely aligned.

A deal with the MK, currently emerging as the third biggest party with around 12 per cent, would also be difficult to digest for the ANC, which struggled to clean its reputation after the corruption scandals of the Zuma era.

""What we do know now is that the ANC is in a trilemma,"" said Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, a political analyst at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

""The ANC will have to decide whether it goes with its historical partners, the EFF and MK, or whether it takes an unprecedented step of reaching across the aisle of South African politics in a grand coalition with the DA.

""Anyone of those coalitions is politically unprecedented,"" he said. ""It remains to be seen to what extent that represents a true policy shift in South Africa.""

Less likely scenarios

If the ANC gets a last-minute boost to secure over 45 per cent of the vote, which looks out of reach at this stage, it could try to make a deal with small- or medium-sized parties to form a government.

Analysts have said the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which is strong in KwaZulu-Natal province and is polling at about 3% nationally, could be the ANC's first choice, but its support would be insufficient to secure a majority.

"Court upholds 20-year sentence for teacher who defiled, impregnated 14-year-old pupil","A former teacher at Tembo Primary School will serve a 20-year prison sentence for defiling a 14-year-old pupil after exhausting all legal avenues to regain his freedom.

David Langat was arrested on January 12, 2019, and charged with defilement in a Molo court after it was discovered the minor who was his pupil was pregnant.

The trial court found him guilty on August 13, 2020, and sentenced him to 20 years behind bars.

Langat's appeal against the conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court on July 7, 2021, for lack of merit.

The accused filed a miscellaneous application two years later on October 25, 2023, seeking a rehearing of his sentencing. He argued that his age and the time already served in prison were sufficient punishment and highlighted his rehabilitation through theological classes and counseling services.

Langat also emphasised his remorse and claimed his family and community were willing to accept him back.

“I have changed my behaviour, and have an amicable relationship with my fellow inmates. I am remorseful and regret my actions having undertaken a complete transformation,” Langat stated.

However, the state opposed his application, arguing that the sentence was lawful and emphasised the severity of his crime. The prosecution pointed out that Langat, old enough to be the victim's grandfather, abused his position of authority to defile the minor leading to her pregnancy repeatedly.

“The aggravating circumstances of the case are that the victim was a 14-year-old child in primary school and was defiled several times by the applicant as a teacher in her school Tembo Primary. That further the victim was pregnant during the trial,” stated the prosecution counsel.

Justice Samuel Mohochi in his ruling upheld the original sentence stating that the aggravating circumstances warranted a deterrent sentence and found no basis to alter the original judgment.

“This court is persuaded of the correctness, legality, or propriety of the sentence imposed on August 13, 2020, and finds no basis to disturb the same,” ruled Justice Mohochi.

Trump is a convicted felon. Now what?,"May 30 (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the first former US president to be convicted of a crime, will remain a free man while he awaits sentencing and could avoid a prison term entirely for falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.

Here is a look at what’s next for the Republican candidate for president against Democratic President Joe Biden in a Nov. 5 election.

What happens now?

The judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, must first approve the verdict and enter a final judgment, though this is typically a formality.

Criminal defendants in New York are typically sentenced within several weeks of conviction, but post-verdict legal wrangling can sometimes lead to months of delays. In the meantime, lawyers and prosecutors will recommend sentences and then argue over them at Trump’s sentencing hearing, where Merchan will make a decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely.

The maximum sentence for Trump’s crime of falsifying business records is 1-1/3 to four years in prison.

It is rare for people with no criminal history who are convicted only of falsification of business records to be sentenced to prison in New York. Punishments like fines or probation are more common.

Defendants convicted of falsifying business records who get sentenced to time behind bars typically serve a year or less, and even in those cases most were convicted of other crimes such as fraud or grand larceny - unlike Trump

If punished beyond a fine, Trump could be placed under home confinement or subject to a curfew rather than imprisoned.

As a former president, he has a lifetime Secret Service detail, and the logistics of keeping him safe behind bars could be complicated.

Trump could also be released on bail while appealing his conviction.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes. Trump is likely to make arguments that Merchan rejected ahead of trial, including that the indictment is legally flawed and politically motivated.

He is also likely to argue Merchan deprived him of a fair trial by making legal errors, including allowing salacious testimony by a porn star who said she had sex with Trump - testimony his lawyers said was gratuitous and aimed at inflaming the jury against him.

The defence is likely to argue that the charges themselves were legally improper. Falsifying business records on its own is a misdemeanor in New York, but is elevated to a felony when done to help commit or conceal another crime. In this case, Bragg's office said that other crime was a conspiracy to violate a state election law.

But Trump's lawyers have argued that state law does not apply to federal elections.

Could Trump still be president?

Yes. The US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years.

In theory, Trump could be sworn in from jail or prison on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2025, if he were to unseat Biden.

Explainer: Can Trump be president despite his criminal conviction?,"May 30 - Donald Trump’s criminal conviction for illegally covering up a hush money payment to a porn star will not prevent the Republican candidate from pursuing his campaign to retake the White House, even if he were sentenced to prison before the Nov. 5 election.

Here's why.

How can Trump be president despite the conviction?

The US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years.

Neither a criminal conviction nor a prison sentence would affect Trump's eligibility or his ability to become president. In theory, he could be sworn in from jail or prison if he were to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.

Jailhouse presidential campaigns are not unprecedented in U.S. history. Socialist Eugene Debs unsuccessfully ran for president from prison in the 1920 election, though unlike Trump he was not a serious contender.

Will Trump go to prison?

It is not yet known what sentence, if any, the judge will impose.

Trump could also be released on bail while appealing his conviction.

How could the guilty verdict affect the election?

While the hush money case is widely seen as the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions Trump faces, the guilty verdict could have implications for the election.

Opinion polls show a guilty verdict could cost him votes in an election that will potentially be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states.

One in four Republicans said they would not vote for Trump if he was found guilty in a criminal trial, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters in April.

In the same survey, 60 per cent of independents said they would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of a crime.

Ghosts of our pasts: This is what it’s like to live in an age of trauma,"Our childhood shapes who we are. As young people reach adulthood, many are realising that their past experiences, especially childhood traumas, play a significant role in shaping their mental health and worldview.

A 2020 report by Centres for Disease Control and Prevention found that over 27 per cent of adolescents experienced at least one Adverse Childhood Experience(ACE) – a traumatic event such as abuse, neglect, or household dysfunction.

Studies suggest a higher prevalence of childhood trauma in the current generation compared to older ones. A 2020 study by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection reveals that one in two young adults in Kenya experienced violence as a child.

It is little wonder, therefore, that cases of drug and alcohol abuse, suicide and mental illness among young people are on the rise.

Winnie Machuka, 24I harbour memories from age 10 which have stained the canvas of my life. My childhood was not pleasant at all. I witnessed terrible things. My father and mother were constantly arguing and fighting. I cannot count the number of times we had to run to my grandmother’s place because my mother had been sent packing after a fight. It was chaotic.

While in Class Two, we were living in a single room and one evening, while my mother cooked ugali using a jiko, we heard my father approaching while singing. He was drunk. My mother told us to hide under the bed because when in that state, he was very violent.

That day my father caused chaos. He kicked the sufuria and it landed right next to my younger brother’s head. We were still under the bed as this happened so I struggled to pull him closer so that he wouldn’t get burnt. That memory is still etched in my head. I doubt I will ever forget it.

My parents eventually separated when I was in Class Four after an incident where some Sh20 that my dad wanted to use to buy cigarettes disappeared. Everyone in the house denied taking it and my father let out his anger on me. He beat me up for three hours, as if I was a stray dog. This was the last straw. My mother carried my brother and I and we left.

I never realised the full impact of these experiences until I was in my third year in university. A friend mentioned that I had very bad mood swings. She told me people avoided me because I would easily get angry.

Growing up in a household ridden with conflict, I would read books a lot. That was my way of coping. I was the quiet child who loved books. It reached a point I could not distinguish between my reality and fiction. I had read so much fiction that the stories became my reality.

I also battled memory loss, which I think arose from that toxic family environment. To date, I forget things quickly and my memory span is short. This affected my studies as nothing would stick in my brain, except the bad childhood experiences.

Even now, most of my relationships are strained. I don’t know how to say sorry when I am wrong. While dating, I tend to compare potential partners with my father. Whenever they shout at me, my brain immediately goes back to my childhood and I start expecting them to beat me. Most of my romantic relationships have ended by the fourth month as I am always very afraid that they will lead to physical abuse.

I recently discovered the man I called my father was not my biological dad. Maybe he did all those things since he wasn’t my real father. I am looking for my real father. Whenever I ask my mother why she didn’t get out of the abusive relationship earlier, she tells me that she loved him and had hoped he would change.

In campus, I was depressed, and constantly high on bhang. I smoked a lot of it, and it made the memory loss worse, but it helped at that time. It was my escape mechanism. When high on marijuana, it was easier for me to communicate. I eventually reduced my intake and now I don’t use it at all. I turned to journaling as a coping mechanism, and I have also undergone therapy.

Elizabeth Naimutiae, 33I had a difficult childhood. As a sixth born in a family of eight, you would expect me to be a neglected child, but there I was, the cause of conflict.

Of all my siblings, I was the only one who was keen on going to school, and this was making my parents quarrel. At the time I didn’t know that my father had already betrothed me according to the Maasai culture. My mother on the other hand was adamant that I needed to be given a chance to get an education.

My goal was to study and be someone in future, but my dad had other plans. I was frequently absent from school as I had to graze the cows. If I failed to do so, my father would beat my mother.

There was a time during one of their fights when he grabbed her by the throat and squeezed her so hard that she developed complications and was hospitalised for a week. That scene still replays in mind, and it hurts me to the core.

My father used to shout at me and sometimes beat me up. He used to make me suffer since he was set on marrying me off. He didn’t think school was a priority. I tried seeking help from the head teacher and the district officer, but it was all in vain. As a child I saw myself as worthless. I hated myself.

My father successfully married me off at 16. I dropped out at Form Two but even in Form One, my school attendance was very erratic. Luckily I was married to someone who was only six years older. Nevertheless, our union was really tumultuous. I persevered because in our culture we believe a father’s order carries with it a curse if not followed to the letter.

There was a time, while married, I even tried committing suicide. I felt so low and worthless. When I gave birth to my second child, I even lost breast milk. The child never suckled. In all the hospital visits, I was told to manage my stress levels.

I willed my brain to come to terms with everything that had happened so that I could move on with life, but it was not easy. I had to undergo therapy, and that somehow healed me.

My husband ended up changing for the better and now we are both Christians. We pray and fellowship in church together. I am now a counsellor and I believe healing is a process. Accept what is troubling you, then start letting go.

Mercyline Kao, 25At age six, my younger brother and I were left in the care of relatives while our mother went to Nairobi to look for work. Instead of the care we needed, we faced a lot of cruelty. One memory that stands out is when I fell from a tree and injured my ankle, then my auntie repeatedly hit that ankle to punish me. She was a devout churchgoer and a sister to my mother but she became our tormentor.

My brother and I lived in constant fear. One day, a male relative attacked my brother with a jembe and nearly split his head into two. We had to flee to a neighbour’s house. This was just one of the many incidents that left us physically and emotionally scarred.

Our ordeal didn’t end when we moved to another relative’s house. We only encountered different forms of abuse. At one point, I was sexually assaulted by my cousins. The trauma was overwhelming. It left me with deep feelings of worthlessness and a pervasive fear of men that would haunt me for years.

A glimmer of hope appeared when our mother secured a stable job in Nairobi and brought us to live with her. However, escaping the past was not easy. My trust in human beings was shattered, and I often felt isolated, haunted by the memories of my childhood. I hate relatives who mistreat children left in their care. Every time I hear on the news that someone has harmed to a child, I get enraged. However, I don’t blame my mother. She didn’t know the nightmare she was exposing us to by leaving us behind.

As a teenager, I used to cry a lot and at times even as a young adult, there are days I am overwhelmed by emotions when I recall the traumatic experiences we underwent. When it comes to relationships, my male friends think I am difficult to approach because I don’t welcome or tolerate their advances.

Healing has been a long and painful process. Therapy has been instrumental, but the scars remain.

Patrick Maina, 22My three siblings and I were brought up in a normal family setting. The person who married my mother, however, is not my biological father, and the two of them were always fighting. My dad frequently and openly beat up my mother. We would be having supper and then all of a sudden, someone gets slapped.

The man I called my father would hurl hurtful words at me and my elder brother, reminding us that we were not his children. He would tell us that we were draining his finances since he had to take care of our needs and if not for us, he would be wealthier.

These words would ring in my mind like a bell. They affected my concentration in school, yet I would be beaten to pulp for any slight dip in performance.

I have regrets for things that were not even my fault. I feel like my mother went through domestic violence because of my brother and I. I am an introvert not by nature. I forced myself to be one because my self-esteem was severely affected by my father’s hurtful and abusive words.

In high school, as a coping mechanism, I turned to alcohol and was later introduced to bhang. I was expelled due to drug abuse. I used to overdose then act mad and forget about things. Thankfully I finished secondary school. However, things became even worse in university. Due to increased freedom, I started injecting substances into my veins to calm the voices in my head.

I quit all that and now I prefer to pray and read articles about trauma management.

Boniface Waingo, 26I was born to parents whose relationship soured shortly after I was born. I think I was only a few months old when my mother decided to leave, taking me with her. Without any notice or explanation, my mother returned to her parents' home. I spent my childhood living with my maternal grandparents, and during that period, I constantly felt out of place. I really longed for my father.

By the time I reached Grade Three, I was taken back to his father's relatives because I used to cry too much while asking for him.

I didn’t realise I had made a terrible mistake. At my father’s place, life was hard. There I was, a nine-year-old with people I didn’t have any connection with and nobody to take care of me as my mother did.

I lived through that challenging life, but the longing for a complete family continued to haunt me. I remember crying every day, and asking God to give me both parents like my peers. I felt a huge void in my life.

I remember reaching out to my mother after Class Eight asking for her support to join a boarding high school, but she refused, saying that I had chosen my father’s side and I had to face the consequences. My mother’s side of the family was wealthier than my dad’s and I knew she could afford to take me to boarding school, so her response broke my heart.

I went to a day school more than a month after the reporting day since my father struggled to find fees.

Shifting between my parents' homes while young, and the lack of family support greatly affected my mental health. Even now, I often feel anxious and I struggle to understand my place in the world.

Some sports betting mayhem in May and the reincarnation of Safari,"Of course, as a hustler, I am into sports betting. And last Sunday, the last day of the EPL season, was a good payday.Three of the eight teams I had bet on let me down – Aston Villa, Brighton and Burnley, but five came through – Liverpool, Tottenham, Fulham, Newcastle and of course, Chelsea FC.

But the best bet I had made was on the last day of December, 2023, when Arsenal was at 40 points, five ahead of second-placed Man City, and their fans posted all those memes with pachyderms perched atop trees, with captions like ndovu ni kuu!

I had bet Sh1,500 that Man City would win the league by end of May, and on Sunday, they did, winning me four times my bet amount. Throw in the Sh5,000 from my quintet of Sunday winners, and I had Sh11,000 on my phone.

Monday morning found me at the DCI Desk of the Central Police Station in Nairobi, where I met a very efficient-sounding investigating officer called Kangethe who assured me, alongside his boss, that we would prosecute those Gitanga Close frauds.

“Watch out Odongo, Odhiambo and Onesmus,” I said to myself, “If you don’t refund my money. Mr Zhang and I are coming for you!”

Then, midweek, out of the blue skies, as I sat thinking of my next investment moves in case I did not make my end month deadline to partner in Safara Mascara, I get a call from a most unexpected person.

Desiree Simaloi, my ex-colleague and recent paramour, sent my pulse racing.

“My guy,” she said in a syrupy voice, “How have you been this last fortnight?”

“Pretty crappy actually, Simaloi,” I said truthfully, perhaps just longing for a touch of human sympathy. “I got taken to the cleaners by some city swindlers for a fake fertiliser procurement deal…”

“Pole sana,” Desiree said softly. Then her voice hardened. “Go after them hard! And if you do take them to court, I am good friends with a top criminal prosecutor.”

“Good friends?” I said.

“Okay,” I could hear the shrug in her voice. “I am actually married to him.”

“Oh Desiree,” I sighed. “Are you happy?”

Switching the subject, her tone now businesslike, Simaloi said, “That other day, I think I forgot my tablet on charge in your living room.”

“You did?” I said. “I did not see any tablet, Desiree…”

“Well, I did.”

“Let me check when I get to my place in the evening,” I said. “If it’s there, I will send a rider to bring it to your residence, if you drop me a PIN.”

“I am sure it’s there,” Simaloi said with finality. “I’ll pass by at 7pm to pick it up. And you better have a tasty supper ready, you Safara. I will be very hungry.”

I was home by half past 5pm, turning my place upside down for a tablet I had never seen. Was Desiree using a fake tablet as an excuse to come over?

As if by deux machina, Laura’s name lit up on my phone. We hadn’t spoken in two weeks.

“Hello?” I answered the phone, the caution obvious in my voice, as always with her. “How are you doing, Mama Neo?”

“Not your concern,” she snapped. “Are you aware wakina Neo walirudi shule last week, and I had to pay half the 50K fees?”

“I got conned by some wicked hustlers,” I started to say, “but I am in the process …”

“Staki stories zako, Baba Neo,” she snapped. “Mi ni 50K school fees I need.”

A light flashed in my head. “Laura, did you take a tablet from my place the other morning when you were here?”

A short silence, and then: “Neo took it. He now plays games on it. Kuna shida?”

“Yes!” I said, knowing my young son would never pick things without permission. “It belongs to my colleague, ex that is, and she needs it back.”

“Does she now?” Laura said. “It’s okay. Buy Neo a new one, and you can have it back …”

“Mama Neo,” I said, a desperate edge to my voice, “that tablet ain’t mine, and I don’t have money right now to buy the boy a new one…”

“Or to pay his fees, or for his food or rent or clothing,” Laura retorted. “Here’s the deal – pay half the fees, get him a new tab, and you can get back this one. Bye!”

And as she hung up, the doorbell rang, scaring me with its sharp shrill. Desiree Simaloi was here early!!

“Coming, coming,” I called out, a bit vexed, as the bell slashed my eardrums twice.

“Simaloi,” I said, as I threw the door open – and then I almost fainted.

For standing there in the hallway was Safari Safara, my first cousin, whom I had seen swept away by the floods at the beginning of May in a Mazda.

Either him, or the ghost of Safari, come for vengeance, for my abandonment of him to his watery fate, a few weeks ago.

 ,"Every year, thousands of Kenyans seek greener pastures in the US. Some get lucky, others do not. For those who do, some start with menial jobs and rise to set up their thriving businesses.

Naomi Ogutu, 48, Kea Wakesho Simmons, 41, and Nancy Gakere, 50, are among Kenyans who have found success in the US, all in the travel industry.

Nancy has been living abroad for over 30 years.

“I came to the US in 1990 at the age of 17. I had just finished high school in Kenya so I came here to attend college,” she says.

She started off as an accountant, before turning her travelling hobby into a business.

“I started blogging in 2019. I used to share my travel adventures. As an accountant, travelling was my way to wind down and escape my hectic work environment,” she says.

She soon got a following from enthusiasts, who started asking if they could travel with her.

“I decided to curate group trips to places I had been to and offer them to my followers to allow them to have the same experience. This seemed to resonate with many of them who wanted to travel but didn’t know how to make it a reality,” she says.

Fancy Nancy Travels

Being a business that requires minimal capital—just cash to create the website and social media management—the travel curation enterprise picked up fast.

She named it Fancy Nancy Travels.

“All the clients need to do, is show up, and everything is taken care of; from the moment they arrive to the moment they leave,” says Nancy, who runs the company that operates out of Los Angeles, CA.

Read: Kenyan named among top investors in US

“This is a business that came about as a natural progression from my passion for travel. It’s a hobby turned into a business. My clients are mainly African women in the diaspora, with the majority based in the US. I connect with them mainly through social media,” she says.

Is being an entrepreneur in the US better than being in Kenya? I ask.

“I haven’t done much business in Kenya, so it’s hard to compare, but I can say that the business environment in the US is quite regulated and straightforward,” she says.

She usually takes clients to countries she has visited, which as of now, is 30 countries.

“In 2023, I took clients to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Indonesia (Bali). In 2024, the trips are to Greece, Cuba, the Maldives and Indonesia (Bali),” says Nancy.

As she grows her business, does she feel like she has achieved her dream?

“I feel like I am still on the path to achieving the American dream, but definitely on the right path,” says the entrepreneur, who urges people to focus on the passion and not the money.

“I honestly did not think about establishing the company, but things progressed naturally to where I needed to formalise it,” she says.

Taxi driver

Naomi Ogutu is another Kenyan living in the US who has found success in the travel industry.

She went to the US in 2012 and started by working as a taxi driver.

She had vowed that by the tenth year of her stay in the US, she would be an employer, and indeed, her dream had been fulfilled.

When she reached the US, it was not easy to settle.

“It took us one year to finally get our papers right, but we got our work permits in six months. No one hosted us. When I landed at JFK with my family, we booked a hotel, and after a week, we got an apartment (not easy - we were assigned by a non-profit organisation called CAMBA) which got us an apartment and connected us with Upwardly Global for New Americans. I guess the fact that no one hosted me, gave me the courage and confidence to use my independent thinking in navigating my life here in the US,” she says.

“I’m sure if I were hosted by anyone, they would have discouraged me from even living in New York City; that’s understandably very expensive. But through all my struggles, I’ve thrived,” she says.

Read: Striking gold abroad

Her first real job in 2013 was in retail, where she worked at a high-end retail chain on 5th Avenue and 53rd Street Manhattan for three months. Her second job is where she received training and placement at an agency that got her a job at a major electric company in New York.

“I was a systems administrator in their sub-surface construction department. My work entailed being a focal point of contact and coordination of the field crews, the engineering department and the HR department. My work was to update these three departments on work progress, troubleshooting and reporting lost hours due to emerging issues in the field and any work delays. My contract ended after three years and I moved on,” she says.

Ms Ogutu’s third job was at the New York University Treasury Department. “Here, I started as an administrative assistant and in a few months, my manager moved me to auditing. I lasted just one year in this job, and in 2016, I made a big blunder at work that almost got me fired, but I opted to resign before they could fire me,” she says.

Personal challenges

At that time, she was going through personal challenges which affected her work.

“I even contemplated suicide. I was saved by a truck driver as I sat by the Mississippi River (a sign read ‘This is the highest point of the Mississippi River’). I was contemplating jumping in. But that Good Samaritan or angel just held my hand, took me to a Wendy’s restaurant, bought me lunch and let me cry and tell him everything! A white man I didn’t even know. He gave me his number on a paper but I threw it away. I couldn’t face him after that incident,” she says.

Her business idea was born right by the banks of the Mississippi River.

“I went back to New York with my mind made up. It was my time. One day, an Uber driver named Famara from Senegal drove me home. We talked a lot and he told me, ‘Hey sister, Uber business is good. We make even a lot of money stress-free. No clocking into an office, no boss, no schedule—you create your own schedule.’ So he told me about the master Cabbie Academy and in 2017, I was already an Uber driver in New York City.”

After getting her New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission license and registration, she immediately started driving for Uber and Lyft in New York City’s five boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island.

She established her firm in 2018, but incorporated it in 2020 as an S-Corporation, Naomi Cars NYC, with offices on West 57th Street, in Midtown Manhattan, NYC.

“In 2018, I started marketing my sightseeing tours to my Uber clients. If we clicked with a client, I would offer them my business card and let them know I’m available to take them around and showcase the beauty and hidden gems of New York City. Now I have six tour guides, and I work with 19 drivers who are independent contractors,” she says.

Entrepreneurship was not a new game. Ms Ogutu had been in business in Kenya before moving to the US.

She ran a bookstore in Nairobi which supplied books to colleges and universities.

“I knew that in the US, hard work pays, and the business environment there was straightforward and rewarding. Kenya was okay, but I was constantly chasing after procurement officers to get paid. You are taken around circles, just to bribe. I got tired of the corruption and lack of ethics,” she says.

Has she achieved what she had hoped to? I ask.

Good life

“My journey abroad was propelled by the desire to give my children a good life. I’m a single mother of three children. My firstborn daughter, 23, works for the state of New Jersey. My son,19, is a freshman at SUNY Polytechnic Institute, studying Mechanical Engineering Technology, and is already on the Engineering Department Dean’s List. He’s on a full scholarship to a microchip manufacturing company that has also offered him a very prestigious paid summer internship. My other daughter, 17, is also headed to college with a full-ride scholarship. She’s been admitted to 20 universities, but she has zeroed in on two - RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), which offered her the scholarship, and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University to study aeronautical engineering. We are waiting to get her scholarship package, then she will decide where to go,” she says.

There are many job opportunities that have sprouted from travel. Kea Wakesho Simmons, another Kenyan travelled abroad for the first time to Korea when she was 23. She says that it was out of curiosity about the world and different cultures and histories.

Her travel business also started with a passion for new destinations.

“I worked in the US Army as a human resources specialist and served for five years, including deployments to Iraq and Korea. During my time in Korea, my passion for travel was ignited, fueling my desire to explore the world,” says Wakesho.

In 2011, she left the military and went to Afghanistan, as a civilian.

“I worked there for three and a half years. I was coordinating over 5,000 personnel and managing administrative procedures. I worked in Estonia, Bulgaria, and Iraq for seven and a half years. Living and working in these countries allowed me to visit 45 different countries and live in seven,” she says.

She wanted to share her extensive travel with the world, hence she co-founded a travel concierge firm World Views, with a capital of $10,000 (Sh1.32 million.)

“One of my notable achievements was leading a group of over 100 travellers to Kenya, where I introduced a fresh perspective on Afro-tourism in Africa. Recently, I expanded my efforts to Central America. In 2023, I relaunched my business under Traverze Culture, continuing to provide the same services,” she says

Traverze Culture is out of the US and has its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, with a team of 12 employees.

What to do when you get a painful rejection letter,"The number of rejections a candidate encounters before receiving a job offer is unknown. But, it doesn’t matter how many times you've been turned down, a rejection still hurts. However, that doesn’t mean you should curl up on the floor and cry. You can transform a ""No"" into opportunity. Here is how.

Self-controlWhen your application is rejected, control your emotions. Do not vent in a professional email or conversation with potential employers. Don't take any actions that could jeopardise future opportunities. Be polite, thank the prospective employer for their time, and request feedback on what you could have done more effectively. Most of the time, you won't hear anything specific, but a hiring manager might offer advice that will help you stand out in your upcoming applications or interviews.

Redirect the negative energyAfter being rejected, anger, disappointment, grief and frustration often follow. Try to channel these feelings into something positive. You could pursue new opportunities, go to the gym, or take up a new hobby.

Take note of what happenedTo ease the sting, do some self-analysis. Reread your resume and cover letter and find ways of making them more appropriate for the position. If there was an interview, take note of ways to improve. You may have appeared stiff and uncertain of yourself because of the tension from a hurried and busy morning, or you were taken aback by a question.

Consider what would make each day wonderfulA fantastic offer from your ideal employer would undoubtedly be on the list, but consider additional opportunities, both large and small, that could enable you to incorporate happiness and pleasant interactions into each day. Choose an action to take at the beginning of each day and follow through with it, especially during the stressful interview periods. You could meet friends for happy hour after work, go to the gym, cook a beautiful supper or catch up on a TV show. This can help relieve stress.

Accept and move onSuccessful candidates take time to reflect on their momentary setback and pick lessons from it. They also take note of the pleasant experiences in their daily lives.

This doesn’t mean you become unrealistically happy. We are inclined to make comparisons between ourselves and our role models. As we do that, we tend to forget that they may have formerly faced rejection. When successful people reflect on their paths, they often view rejections and failure as crucial and indispensable stepping stones on their path to success.

 ,"Yvette Obura first captured public attention in 2017 when news broke of her relationship with former gospel singer Kevin Kioko, popularly known as Bahati. Since then, the mother of one has become an internet sensation who attracts both praise and criticism online.

In this interview, Yvette discusses her journey of building her career as an influencer despite her introverted nature, discusses the highs and lows of celebrity hood, and the strategies she employs to handle the pressure.

1. What did you study in school?I have a Bachelor's degree in business and IT from KCA University. I have never practised it though. It was a course my parents wanted and I also liked it. To date my parents still wonder why they took me to the university. However I am glad I took the course because the knowledge I acquired helps me in my business. I am able to handle so many issues with ease, including book-keeping and accounting.

2. What projects are you currently working on, and do you get a good income from influencing?I am in the process of bringing back my fashion line, 'Yvette Fashion Hub'. I'm slowly reviving it after taking a two-year break to focus on influencing. My sister, who loves fashion and already has her fashion line, inspired me to start my own. Now, I'm returning to it with full dedication.

As for influencing, it pays very well. However, I struggle because I am camera-shy and prefer to keep my personal life private. Despite getting many gigs in the industry, I often feel that this career isn't for me, but the financial rewards motivate me to continue. There are certain gigs I decline because they don't align with my beliefs.

The great thing about influencing is that once you do a good job for one client, other opportunities follow, so there's not much struggle to find work. Currently, I am working with about five brands, with Showmax being the biggest one.

3. How did you and Bahati meet, and how has your life in the public been since then?We met through a mutual friend in 2011. By the time I came into the limelight in 2017, I had known him for six years. Life in the public has been a mix of positive and negative experiences. I have had to overcome tough challenges just like other public figures such as Eliud Kipchoge, who recently trended online for discussing his social media tribulations.

The harshest criticism I've faced online is related to my past relationship with Bahati. Bullies targeted me through my daughter. I've been called a deadbeat and irresponsible mum because my daughter spends time with her dad. This negativity stems from being in the limelight. Many parents co-parent, and children live with their dads without any issue. People who know me personally see me as a devoted mother, but online, I'm judged unfairly.

On the positive side, social media has opened up numerous job opportunities which have helped me financially. When I bought my car, there were rumours that someone else paid for it, but the truth is, I worked hard and saved for it. Despite the challenges, social media has positively impacted my life, and for that, I am grateful.

4. Your co-parenting arrangement with Bahati seems very peaceful. What advice would you give to other co-parents?The peace didn't happen in one day. It took years for us to be where we are right now. I am a cool person and what has worked for me is that I don't cross boundaries and I avoid exchanging words with anyone. That is key. I know that for the 18 years we are raising the child, we need to be cordial with each other.

One of our biggest challenges is that we fight for Mueni's presence, but let me give Diana Marua and Bahati their flowers. Diana takes care of my child in the best way. My daughter has never told me anything negative about Diana. I think where Diana is in life, she has accepted all the children. Bahati has also been consistent in providing, and we have never lacked. My only fear is that I am overprotective because I live in a crowded area so I keep reminding my nanny to take care of my daughter because so many people know her and I don't know their intentions.

5. Are you dating?I am currently single and content with where I am in life. My past relationship was quite challenging, and it ended in 2023, affecting not only myself but also my child. It's been about a year since the breakup, and now I'm focused on my family and business endeavours. While I am not a celebrity, being in the public eye means that anyone associated with me also becomes subject to public scrutiny. In my previous relationship, I felt embarrassed when I was held accountable for my partner's past. I regret making that relationship public.

Nyamira governor: Why we visited Ruto at State House,"Our visit to State House, Nairobi was not motivated by personal political interests but the good of the county, Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo says.

The county boss says their mission to the House on the Hill was to engage President William Ruto on matters of development for the benefit of the region and its people.

This came after pictures and updates regarding the visit surfaced online eliciting mixed reactions.

While some residents backed the move as a positive towards uniting the country, others wondered why some elected leaders in Nyamira were excluded from the trip.

""We went to see the President with a development agenda for our county,"" Mr Nyaribo told journalists.

He said the delegation asked President Ruto to consider reviving a number of stalled projects in the county and also initiate fresh ones.

""We have several roads including the one that connects Kemera to Kegati that are yet to be completed,"" Mr Nyaribo said.

Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo meeting President William Ruto at State House Nairobi. Present were MPs Steve Mogaka (West Mugirango), Patrick Osero (Borabu), and Clive Gisairo (Kitutu Masaba).

Other stalled road projects are in North Mugirango, West Mugirango and Borabu constituencies.

""We told the President that there was an urgent need to tarmac Chabera- Nyamaiya Road through Nyamusi,"" he said.

The major road will connect and open up the lower parts of both the North Mugirango and West Mugirango constituencies.

The governor was accompanied to the State House by MPs Stephen Mogaka (West Mugirango), Clive Gisairo (Kitutu Masaba) and Patrick Osero (Borabu).

Mr Nyaribo said that, together, they asked the President to ensure that funding for the Sironga Industrial Park and Esanige Stadium is done on time.

The industrial park, if completed, will create hundreds of jobs for locals.

Mr Nyaribo said the park will not only promote local talent but also boost sports and tourism as well as revenue for the county.

North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko and Nyamira County Senator Okong'o O'Mogeni missed the State House visit.

However, Mr Nyaribo clarified that some of the political leaders who missed the meeting were away on official duty. He singled out county MP Jerusha Momanyi and ODM nominated MP Irene Mayaka.

Nation.Africa has since established that Ms Mayaka is in South Africa as an election observer.

Speaking separately, Kitutu Masaba MP Clive Gisairo assured his constituents that President Ruto will make good his promise to tarmac Motemomwamu- Manga Road.

The road, Mr Gisairo said, will open up the upper parts of the constituency.

""During the visit, I emphasised to the President the need to build the road. There and then, the President took his phone and called Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen and asked what plans were in place regarding the road,"" the MP informed the residents.

He further claimed that instructions from the Head of State had trickled down to the roads engineer in Nyamira County and that construction work would start soon.

The road will enhance the status of Manga Escarpment, Manga Stadium, Manga Sub-county headquarters, schools, and hospitals, among other strategic facilities, he said.

Despite its huge potential as a historical site and a tourists attraction, Manga escarpment is yet to be fully exploited due to various reasons including impassable roads.

The post-State House visit backlash did not come to many as a surprise since Azimio la Umoja – One Kenya Coalition that Mr Nyaribo and his colleagues belong to is on record for condemning and punishing its members who visit the President.

Mr Nyaribo was elected on a United Progressive Alliance (UPA) - and Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya coalition affiliate party.

Last week, Azimio was forced to come to the defence of the National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi and Homa Bay County Governor Gladys Wanga, through a press statement, for accompanying the Head of State to America.

The coalition said the presence of the two leaders in President Ruto's retinue was approved by Azimio boss Raila Odinga.

Some eight ODM legislators who visited President Ruto at State House in 2023 faced disciplinary action by the party and endured the ‘traitor’ tag.

They are MPs Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Paul Abuor (Rongo), Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Walter Owino (Awendo), Caroli Omondi (Suba) and Senator Tom Ojienda (Kisumu).

The ODM top leadership has been holding major rallies in the backyards of rebel MPs to bash them for “betraying” the opposition cause.

Western Tourism Circuit’s low numbers worry stakeholders,"There is concern over declining tourism and under-utilisation of attraction sites in the Western region.

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has reported a low turnout of visitors to its facilities in the Western Tourism Circuit, despite the huge potential.

This has forced stakeholders in the sector to plan for a regional tourism expo in Kitale in August, through which they hope to jump-start the sector.

KWS Western Regional Director Bakari Chongwa said the region’s potential is still untapped.

Speaking to Nation.africa, Mr Chongwa observed the need for stakeholders to focus on innovative strategies to market the region.

He said Western region counties are home to fascinating tourist sites that if well packaged, can be a game changer in the tourism sector.

“We have very great attractions including the unique white elephants in Mt Elgon National Park, the rare Sitatunga antelopes at Saiwa Swamp National Park and Kakamega Forest’s unique birds,” noted Mr Chongwa.

He said key stakeholders in the sector like hoteliers and travel agencies have a huge role to play in the marketing region.

Trans Nzoia Tourism Association chairperson Naomi Karani noted that the August expo will be a platform to identify the region's potential and challenges that have caused a disconnect between players in the sector.

Ms Karani said part of the concern is the declining investment in the sector.

She revealed that the stakeholders are working with the Lake Region Counties Tourism Association and Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) to identify key exhibitors who will showcase and package tourism for marketing.

KNCCI Trans Nzoia County chairman Titus Killong’ said the expo will be a milestone to improve the region’s tourism sector both locally and internationally.

“We want to use the expo to also package Trans-Nzoia as an agricultural hub. This is part of our strategy to maximise specific attractions in our region,” he added.

Vihiga woman stranded and ill in Saudi Arabia after dream job turns sour,"When Knight Ajenya left her home in Vihiga County in October 2023 for Saudi Arabia, she was in high spirits and full of expectations.

She was hoping to transform her family's fortunes and send her three children to good schools.

The 33-year-old Ajenya learnt about the job opportunity in Saudi Arabia from Mary Musembe, a neighbour who had returned to the village from Nairobi for a holiday in April last year.

Musembe would later introduce Ajenya to an agent in Nairobi, who was identified only as Ruth.

Ajenya and several other young women who shared the same aspirations would later be taken to Limuru by the said agent for a six-month training before heading out to their prospective employers in the Gulf.

Embarked on her journey

Ajenya's father, Nerbert Otiende, recalled how his daughter approached him for his final blessings before she embarked on her journey to the land of greener pastures.

“Having been a hawker on the streets of Kisumu for over 20 years, I saw my daughter’s proposal as a potential game changer. Life was so difficult for all of us, more so, after her marriage failed. It was such a daunting task taking care of the kids with my meagre earnings,” Mr Otiende explained.

Ajenya could call her father nearly every day during her first few weeks in Saudi Arabia and update him about the goings on.

“She would tell me about her life, how warm she was received by her employer's family and how friendly the family was,” Mr Otiende recalled.

However, after two months Ajenya’s dreams of making it hit headwinds. Suddenly, the frequent phone calls to her father disappeared. Mr Otiende was worried. He would later learn that his daughter had quit her job and went to live in a holding camp for unclear reasons.

""I tried to seek her explanation for what transpired in vain. Our communication had deteriorated so much since she no longer had a phone and was relying on well-wishers to talk to us,"" narrated Mr Otiende.

Ajenya would later stay in the camp for a few days while job hunting. It was during that period that she fell seriously ill, attracting the attention of a fellow Kenyan woman who was also putting up at the camp.

According to her father, her health condition worsened since she could not get immediate medical attention due to insufficient funds.

Nearby hospital

“Her friend took her to a nearby hospital where she was only given some paracetamol,” Mr Otiende said.

He says his daughter only survives on fluids because the infection in her throat cannot allow her to eat solid foods.

""Up to this moment we still don't know what she is ailing from since no medical examination has been conducted to determine the exact illness,"" said Mr Otiende.

The 58-year-old man said that he had tried several times to reach out to the agent responsible for his daughter’s placement, but she declined to help get his daughter back home.

“Whenever I call her all she says is that she cannot assist me since she is yet to benefit from my daughter’s job in the Gulf,” he recounted.

Ajenya is now under the care of a Kenyan friend who identified herself to Mr Otiende as Kagai.

“It is through this Kagai that we are able to receive updates about my child. She has been the one taking her to the hospital whenever her condition worsens. As a family we can’t even afford to raise money for her air ticket back home,"" he said.

Homa Bay man in court over theft of UDA election gadget,"A man has been charged in a Homa Bay court with assaulting a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) clerk and robbing him of an electronic gadget used by the party to conduct grassroots elections.

Mr Robert Ongaro was accused of using force to dispossess the clerk, identified as Godwin Okello, of the gadget during the first phase of the UDA's grassroots elections.

The court heard that the accused was part of a group of people who stormed a polling station last month and assaulted UDA election officials before stealing from the clerk.

Ongaro faced two charges, including robbery with violence.

Robbery with violence convicts face the death penalty.

On the first count, the court was told that on April 26, when the UDA was conducting its primary elections, Ongaro, together with others not present in court, robbed Mr Okello by force.

The court heard that they contravened Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code.

Stole (a) gadget

""You are charged that on April 26, 2024, at 2:30pm at Ongeti Primary School in Omoya in Kagan jointly with others not before court while armed with sticks you robbed from Godwin Okello of UDA and stole (a) gadget serial number 202404035 labelled Homa Bay/Rangwe/ Kochia/ Ongeti Primary School property of UDA and a mobile phone, property of Gordon Okello and used violence against the said person,"" read the charge sheet.

The suspect was also charged with creating a disturbance and acting in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace contrary to Section 95 (1) (b) of the Penal Code.

The charge sheet also accused Ongaro of assaulting the UDA returning officer.

He denied both charges when he appeared before Homa Bay Chief Magistrate Joy Wesonga.

The prosecution has called five witnesses in the case.

The case will be mentioned on June 11, 2024, while a hearing has been set for June 19, 2024.

 ,"On the night of September 10, 2018, Police Constable Yunus Ali Athman received a phone call from his superiors, which left him in a court battle to prove his innocence six years later.

The phone call reported a criminal gang in Likoni, allegedly terrorising locals and stealing items, including livestock.

Athman told a Mombasa court that he was at his home in Mtongwe when he received a call from his superiors at the Mtongwe Police Station.

""I was instructed to go to the location where the criminals were hiding. An informant was supposed to contact me and lead me to their hideout,"" he recalled.

Since the informant delayed contacting him, he decided to go directly to the station to inquire about the assignment. He had been assigned to be part of the special team dealing with criminal gangs in Likoni.

Read: Vengeful GSU officer who raped his former sister-in-law jailed for 15 years

""While on my way to the station, I received another call informing me that the OCS had arranged for someone to guide me to the criminals,"" he told the court.

Athman then met with the informant, Mr Mohamed Kassim Karega, and they took a motorbike to Mwanza village in Likoni, where the alleged criminals were hiding.

The motorbike rider was Mr Albert Wekesa.

Upon reaching the hideout of the criminals, they did not find the gang as expected.

Mbaraka Maitha Omar

They then proceeded to a house owned by Mbaraka Maitha Omar. The information provided to Mr Athman suggested that Omar was part of the gang wielding machetes, responsible for stealing cattle in the area.

""I looked inside and saw no one. The door was partially open. Soon after, Omar appeared and brandished a machete,"" he said.

At that moment, the officer reportedly fired at Omar, shooting him twice and leaving him injured.

Subsequently, Mr Athman and Mr Karega were arrested and charged with Omar's murder. While the charge against Mr Karega was dropped, the state proceeded with prosecuting Mr Athman for the incident.

On Wednesday, before the court, Mr Athman regretted responding to the phone call and proceeding to the assignment.

""I wish I had known there was a machete there; I would not have gone,"" he told High Court Judge Anne Ong'injo.

The officer admitted before the judge that he was involved in the fatal shooting of Omar while searching for criminal gangs in Likoni.

However, Mr Athman informed the court he was defending himself from the threat of an imminent attack, as he was confronted by a machete-wielding suspect.

Mr Athman informed Justice Ong’injo that he shot Omar twice, in the arm and head, in self-defence.

Stepped back

""Omar attempted to attack me with a machete, but I stepped back and shot him in the hand. I continued shooting, and the bullet hit him in the head. I was at risk of being killed. My gun only had six bullets,"" Mr Athman stated.

Also read: Ex-KDF officer: I was chained inside DCI headquarters for a year without trial

Following the shooting, the suspect claimed that other criminals, supposedly the deceased's accomplices, arrived, forcing him to escape to a nearby thicket to hide.

He claimed that if he had not used his gun to defend himself when Omar attacked him, he would be dead.

However, Mr Athman denied any involvement in planning the murder.

""It was a moment of panic, I had never faced such a situation before. I shot him to make an arrest. I wanted him to drop the machete so I could apprehend him, that was my intention. My life and that of the two others who were with me were in jeopardy,"" he explained.

Through his lawyer Eugene Wangila, Mr Athman stated that he was not acquainted with the deceased before the incident and was led to  Omar's residence by an informant.

The officer informed the court that the deceased tried to attack Karega and Wekesa upon their entry into his house during the search.

""Kassim and Wekesa retreated and fled, but I remained still. He intended to harm me as I was in close proximity,"" he explained during questioning by state prosecutor Bernard Ngiri.

Athman has denied killing Omar.

He was initially charged alongside Mr Karega, who later became a state witness.

On a motorcycle

The court was informed that on the day of the incident, Mr Athman went to Omar's residence to make an arrest.  He was accompanied by Mr Karega on a motorcycle driven by Mr Wekesa.

Upon arrival at the mentioned residence, Mr Athman allegedly shot and killed Omar.

Mr Wekesa, a crucial witness in the murder trial against Mr Athman, also died under mysterious circumstances. His body was found in the Dongo Kundu area in Kwale.

The court ruled that Athman had a case to answer.

In his defence, Athman stated that the incident was quite peculiar as he did not intend to spill any blood but to make a lawful arrest.

According to the suspect, the deceased refused to greet him when he entered his house but instead started shouting at Mr Karega and threatening him.

The suspect mentioned that it was at this moment that the deceased brandished a machete, leading to a confrontation that resulted in the gunshots.

“I shot him, and he fell. I informed my boss who had tasked me with searching for and arresting the criminal gang,” he said.

Athman noted that cattle were stolen in the area, and the machete-wielding gang had been threatening the locals.

The suspect has requested time to present his final defence to prove his innocence before the court delivers its judgment.

"Man, girlfriend in custody after woman dies in suspected love triangle in Kisumu","A Kisumu court has granted police permission to remand for 14 days two suspects accused of killing a 22-year-old woman on Monday.

The detention will allow detectives at Kondele Police Station to complete investigations into the death of Vince Juma, who was allegedly pushed to her death from the second floor of a rented flat in Lolwe Estate, Kisumu.

The ruling followed a miscellaneous criminal application filed by Naboth Otieno Ondoro, an investigator attached to DCI Kondele Police Station.

He listed the two suspects, Cecil Wilson Omondi and Ashley Jemima Atieno, as first and second respondents respectively.

According to the officer, the two suspects, who are lovers, were arrested on May 28, 2024, after police discovered that they could be involved in the murder of Vince, which happened around 10pm on the material day.

""If the accused are detained at Kondele Police Station, they will assist us in establishing the cause of death of Vince Juma. The lives of the accused are also at risk and if they are released immediately, they could be harmed as members of the public are still agitated by their (alleged) actions,"" said Mr Ondoro.

Jeopardise the investigation

The officer also argued that the suspects posed a flight risk and that releasing them on bail would jeopardise the investigation.

Also read: Jilted lover to serve 30 years in jail for splashing acid in woman’s eyes

A post-mortem examination to determine the true cause of Vince's death is yet to be conducted and therefore investigators want more time to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident.

The case came before Winam Court Senior Principal Magistrate Robert Oanda, who ruled in favour of the detective.

""Upon reading the notice of motion application and hearing the applicant, I hereby order that the respondents be remanded at Kondele Police Station for a period of 14 days to allow DCI conclude investigations,"" said Mr Oanda.

Before her death, Vince allegedly confronted Mr Omondi, who is said to be her ex-boyfriend, at a local mini-mart.

According to a neighbour, Mr Omondi, 30, had gone to buy an ice cream when he met Vince, who also lives in the same area.

She insisted on accompanying Mr Omondi to his house, but he refused.

On reaching the entrance to his rented flat, Mr Omondi quickly locked the gate from the inside before the deceased could enter.

Vince, however, managed to enter the building when a neighbour unlocked the gate to go in.

Riat Institute of Advanced Technology

According to Mr Ojwang, Mr Omondi was in the house with his 20-year-old new girlfriend Ashley - a student at Riat Institute of Advanced Technology.

After a confrontation, there was a scream followed by a thud.

Mr Omondi reportedly called a taxi and rushed the injured woman to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.

Her body was later taken to the hospital's mortuary.

Preliminary investigations by police indicate that she sustained severe head injuries and may have died as a result of excessive bleeding.

Investigators are trying to establish whether the deceased was pushed from the second-floor balcony of the apartment or whether she jumped to her death.

The man helping girls in Homa Bay escape period poverty,"BY GEORGE ODIWUOR

As a learner in primary school, Derrick Geoffrey Onyango recalls seeing some of his female classmates missing lessons because of menstrual hygiene.

In Class Seven, most girls in her class had started their menstrual cycle, but not many could afford sanitary towels, which made them develop low self-esteem.

Geoffrey says some were also caught by surprise and did not understand what was happening to them.

He recalls a day when a teacher asked a girl in their class to answer a question.

""The girl answered the question correctly. She however failed to stand up when answering, and the teacher ordered her to go out as a form of punishment.

“But the girl was still hesitant to leave her seat. It turned out that she was on her menses and had soiled her clothes that day because she didn’t have sanitary towels,” Geoffrey narrates.

The girl did not want anyone to know what was happening to her. Her skirt had blood stains which she was trying to cover.“She finally stood up when the teacher, who did not know about her situation, insisted that she had to leave the classroom. Some of her classmates knew what was happening and came to her aid. They covered her with a sweater and escorted her out.”

Geoffrey says as the girl walked out, some of her peers, especially boys, laughed at her, oblivious to the challenge she was going through.

""I came to learn that the majority of girls who missed school on certain days did so because they could not afford to purchase sanitary towels. They chose to stay home to avoid embarrassment,"" he says.

After the experience, Geoffrey developed a passion for helping teenagers and young girls get sanitary towels.Together with a group of like minded young people, he started an organisation called YADE sanitary pads which offers cheaper sanitary towels to girls from vulnerable communities.

YADE trains adolescent girls on how to make reusable pads with the goal of ending period poverty, stigma and other taboos around menstrual hygiene.

Geoffrey, a law student at Kisii University, says he wants to provide alternative solutions to period poverty that affects girls in slums and rural areas.

Before establishing YADE, he did his research on the accessibility of sanitary towels by adolescents in rural areas, and the results were shocking.

He found out that some girls use pieces of cloth as sanitary towels.

""Others use mattresses. Some do not use anything,"" he says.

His study was backed by other findings from the Department of Health in Homa Bay county.

Because of this challenge, cases of truancy, absenteeism and dropping out among girls in Homa Bay have increased significantly.

Homa Bay is among the leading counties in teenage pregnancies, and most of the girls who fall victim come from poor families.

“Mostly, the teenage girls end up being lured by men who can buy them things like sanitary towels. These men often ask for sexual favours, and when the girl conceives, they disappear into thin air,"" he says.

Geoffrey is Yade’s programme coordinator, and he is assisted by the group's medical officer Kefa Aywa who is a nurse at St Paul's Mission Hospital, and Fauzia Mustafa who is a medical student. The group also works with volunteers who include teachers from schools whose students have benefited from the programme.

On May 17, the team went to Nyakango Mixed secondary school where more than 150 students, including boys, were taught how to make reusable sanitary towels.

At the school, 63 students have become pregnant between 2021 and now. 55 others contracted urinary tract infections between 2022 and this year, with some cases being caused by poor menstrual hygiene.

""*We have been using our money all along. We spend up to Sh 30,000 in one lesson,"" he says. The money is used to purchase the different materials used in making the towels.

The materials used include nylon, cotton and polyester. Other tools used in making the reusable sanitary towels include scissors, thread and sewing needle.

“During our lessons, learners start by drawing a sketch that resembles a cross on a piece of paper. Using the sketch, they cut out the materials and get the correct measurements. The pieces of waterproof material are joined using sewing thread, and two pieces of cotton are then put in between the layers.

“Once the materials are put together, an outer layer is added at the bottom, which has buttons or stickers that hold onto innerwear. We advise girls to have at least three pads which they can wash and use for several months,” Mustafa says.By March this year, the team had reached more than 1,000 students in 10 different schools in Homa Bay.

Aywa says use of materials such as mattresses and cloths during menses can lead to urinary tract infections because such materials are not sterile.

“Bacterial buildup may extend to the uterus and cause diseases such as pelvic inflammatory illnesses, and could also cause infertility,” Aywa says. [email protected]

Kenyan beach volleyball teams’ work cut out to qualify for Paris Olympics,"Kenya’s historic appearance in beach volleyball at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games remains a landmark moment.

Although the pair of Brackcides Agala and Gaudencia Makokha lost all their Pool “D” matches in Tokyo, qualifying for the quadrennial competition was a major achievement. Their journey to the Tokyo Olympics was as fulfilling as their debuts.

Not least because they upset favourites and hosts Morocco in the semifinals of the CAVB Continental Cup before beating Nigeria 2-1 in the final to punch the ticket to the Japanese capital.

Three weeks from now, the crème de la crème of African volleyball will converge on the coastal city of Tetouan in Morocco for the 2024 CAVB Continental Cup, which will double up as the qualifiers for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

And just like in the previous edition held in Agadir, Morocco 2021, the winners in both gender categories will be Africa’s sole representatives at the Paris Olympics. Kenya (women) and Morocco (men) represented Africa in the Tokyo 2020 edition, and they will head to Tetouan hoping to replicate their 2021 heroics.

Stiff competition

Kenya will once again face stiff competition from reigning African Games champions Doaa Elghobashy and Marwa Abdelhady of Egypt and Morocco’s Imane Yakki and Nora Darrhar. Mozambique’s Ana Paula Sinaportar and Vanessa Muianga would have been potential contenders in the women’s category, but they will skip the qualifiers due to the former’s school commitments.

In the men’s competition, Gambia, Egypt and Mozambique will look to challenge Morocco’s Mohamed Abicha and Zouheir El-Graoui for the sole ticket reserved for Africa. The pair will be gunning for back-to-back appearances at the Olympic Games on home soil.

While Morocco’s Abicha and El-Graoui have maintained their partnership since 2021, the same cannot be said of Kenya’s women’s team, partly because of a knee injury that Agala has since recovered from.

A lot has happened since their Olympic Games debut in Tokyo. Agala and Makokha no longer play together, with the latter having reunited with her old friend Naomi Too in the latest KVF beach volleyball stop held earlier this month, while the former has forged a formidable partnership with the seasoned Phoscah Kasisi.

Too’s return is a welcome boost to the national team, given her vast experience on the sand and impeccable backcourt defence. However, she presents a selection headache for head coach Salome Wanjala, who had paired Makokha with Yvonne Wavinya for the Zone Five qualifiers for the Continental Cup held in Mombasa last December.

Residential training

With Agala also returning from injury, Wanjala has to decide who will play alongside Makokha in Tetouan. It’s worrying that three weeks before this qualifier, the provisional squad is yet to be named, and the team is yet to report to camp for residential training!



It’s not lost on anyone that Egypt’s Doaa and Marwa are in rich form, having topped the Zone Five qualifiers last year before convincingly winning the African Games title in March in Accra, Ghana. Last weekend, they took part in the Beach Pro Tour Futures event in Battipaglia, Italy, under the watchful eye of their Italian coach, Nicolangelo Antonicelli.

Even though they lost all their Pool “B” matches to USA’s Madison Shields and Avery Poppinga and Italy’s Viktoria Orsi Toth and Valentina Cali, the Egyptians faced quality opponents and are a step ahead in terms of preparations.

Similarly, Morocco’s Yakki and Darrhar defeated Cubans Kailin Garrido and Mileidy Paret 2-1 (21-18,19-21,15-11) in the final of the second stop of the Morocco national tour held last weekend at the Martil beach in Tetouan. The thrilling final lasted almost an hour.

To underline their resolve to qualify for the Paris Olympics, Egypt and Morocco have scheduled two stops of their national tours in June to fine-tune their teams for the Continental Cup.

Historic performance

If the quality of preparations by Egypt and Morocco is anything to go by, then Kenya has their work cut out in the women’s competition. It will take another historic performance for Kenya to qualify this time round, and you have to feel sorry for the players and coaching staff who did their part in December by qualifying for the Continental Cup well ahead of time.

Three weeks is certainly not enough to prepare for a Championship of this magnitude, but I’m certain the girls will give their all in Tetouan. Whether that will be enough to qualify, remains to be seen, but Kenyans will be cheering them from home and praying endlessly for a miracle.

The odds don’t favour Kenya in the men’s competition either. Gambia has pitched camp in Qatar under FIVB coach Mounir Ghellaimi courtesy of the transformational FIVB Volleyball Empowerment Programme for almost a year.

Mozambique have been training hard in Sao Paulo under Brazilian coach Alexandre Pontel. The pair of Osvaldo Mungoi and Jose Mondlane has also featured in local circuits in Brazil as part of their preparations for the Paris Olympic qualifiers.

Egypt’s Atef Nassif and Youssef Ismail also featured in the qualification round of the Beach Pro Tour Futures event in Battipaglia, Italy, while Morocco’s Abicha and El Graoui are in good form, having won the first two stops of Morocco’s beach volleyball circuit back-to-back. Kenya men’s team coach Patrick Owino could take solace in the fact that he does not have a selection headache with Elphas Makuto, Jairus Kipkosgei, Brian Melly and Edward Kibet all expected to make the final squad.

However, just like Wanjala, he will bear the brunt of poor preparations and will most likely head to Tetouan hoping for a miracle.

Beres Hammond’s lyrics in his hit song ""Come Down Father"" might just come in handy for us all next month as we pray for the Paris Olympics miracle for our beach volleyballers. Let’s start practising:

 ,"For decades, thousands of residents from the expansive Mbeere area in Embu County have been relying on muguka farming to earn a living.

The recent ban imposed on its sale, transportation and distribution in Mombasa and Kilifi counties has, therefore, dealt them a devastating blow.

Statistics obtained from Embu County indicate that at least 65,000 residents are engaged in muguka production and the number is increasing.

Coast counties serve as the biggest markets for the produce that is estimated to contribute some Sh22 billion to the county’s economy.

The muguka value chain, Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire said, contributes approximately Sh1 million to the Mombasa economy per day in transport levies.

Muguka farmers, and other players who have invested heavily in its value chain, lost a lot of money in the one week that the ban was in force before the Embu High Court suspended it.

“I have lost Sh100,000,” Mr Joseph Ireri from Muraru village told the Nation.

""Muguka is the crop that puts food on the table, it also enables us to educate our children and meet other financial obligations easily,"" said Mr Ireri.

The residents recounted how they lived in horrible conditions before they ventured into Muguka business.

One kilogramme of the stimulant goes for between Sh300 and Sh600. During the dry seasons, it sells at up to Sh1,000 a kilo.

""We used to live in dilapidated grass-thatched and mud-walled huts. But now we live in stone buildings and we don't regret growing muguka which is our green gold,"" said Mr Ireri.

""I previously farmed maize but it was not profitable. I used Sh15,000 on my two- acre maize farm but I didn't harvest anything. There was no enough rain and all my maize dried up. This happened for two seasons and I had to give up maize farming. Muguka does well even without much rain,” Ms Mary Muthoni said.

Mr Alexander Kithagu,53, lamented that he incurred huge losses due to the ban.

""My produce went to waste in the farm and I lost Sh150, 000,"" said Mr Kithagu. Farmers usually wake up at 6am to pick their crop and deliver it to the market for sale to brokers who transport it to the coast.

However, on May 22, they woke up to find there were no buyers for their produce.

“That day, we could not deliver our harvests to Muraru town, the largest muguka collection centre. We were worried but there was nothing we could do,"" said Mr Kithagu.

Unlike tea or coffee, he said, muguka farmers are paid promptly on delivery.

Mr Alexander Githinji,31, expressed fears that his two children may not complete their education should muguka farming be banned entirely.

“Muguka is my only source of income. The money I get is used to educate my children and to make my life comfortable,"" said Mr Githinji.

Muguka is a miraa (khat) variety that is green and bushy. It is a stimulant that produces a mild high when chewed. The crop is fast growing and does well in dry lowlands of Embu County, making it less vulnerable to erratic weather conditions.

Ms Mbarire has expressed her concerns over the ban, saying the county government had engaged a team of lawyers to defend muguka farmers.

Ms Mbarire said while the people of Embu are farmers, those from Meru and other areas in the Central region dominate the business as middlemen and transporters. On Monday night, Ms Mbarire led a delegation of leaders to State House to see President William Ruto over the muguka crisis.

The President held talks with the Embu leaders and assured them of his support.

“We met with the President and he agreed with us that muguka farming is legal and should not be interfered with,” said Senator Alexander Mundigi.

The President, he said, assured them the allocation to support miraa production will be raised from Sh135 million to Sh450 million. The Senator who is also the vice-chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the House, said muguka has played a key role in improving the lives of Embu residents.

""I'm one of the beneficiaries of muguka. My parents paid my school fees using muguka and that is why I acquired a good education which enabled me to have a good life. Muguka is not a drug and, as leaders from this region, we shall continue supporting it,” said Mr Mundigi.

A Bill has been tabled in the Senate to provide a legal framework for value addition. Once passed, muguka will be used to make wines, juices, sweets and medicines.

The Kiambeere MCA Lenny Masters Mwaniki told the coast governors to respect the law.

“Muguka is not an outlawed crop and the ban is illegal,"" he said.

“Why should coast governors declare muguka illegal when the law legalises it?” he posed.

Farmers deliver 36 tonnes of muguka to the coast daily, earning them Sh10.8 million.

Stop helicopter gunships on Baringo bandits,"By Abdikadir Noor Fidow

Although one of the many campaign promises of President William Ruto was to crush the bandits operating from Baringo.

However, air strikes are not an option because they do not select the guilty from the innocent but rather destroy life and wealth indiscriminately. The use of air strikes within the borders of the state must be the last option, regardless of their engagements and strength.

Air strikes on civilian citizens are perceived as a sign of weakness of the government and will alienate the community that the targeted group lives with. This could destroy community lives and property, giving the bandits a fertile ground for recruitment to their ranks, causing the expansion of their criminal ideology.

Historically, the governments that used air power on rebels have failed. The targeted rebels expanded, thriving on the sympathy by the people affected by the air strikes. To contain bandits in Baringo and elsewhere, the government should employ the strategy and the machinery used to eliminate Shifta in the eastern and northeastern provinces.

The administration of that time never used air strikes or excessive force but engaged the locational chiefs, assistant chiefs and village elders in the local communities and banditry became history within a few months.

Rising Daniel Mateiko aims to reach for the stars,"“You haven’t seen anything yet.”

That was the message from Daniel Mateiko upon returning from Eugene, United States of America where he won the Kenya’s national trails men’s 10,000m for the Paris Olympic Games on Saturday.

“I have a dream of breaking the barriers just like some of the top athletes I am training with. I also want to feel like a world class athlete,” said Mateiko at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Monday night.

“I have dreams that by God’s grace, I want to fulfil sooner than later.”

After representing Kenya for the first time in 10,000m at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Mateiko noted it was a coincidence that it’s the same place he booked his Paris Olympics ticket.

“It was a dream come true having failed to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. I now have the opportunity and I thank God for it,” said the 25-year-old, who claimed the automatic places in the team for the Paris Olympics with his training mate Nicholas Kimeli, the 2022 Diamond League 5,000m winner.

Mateiko, who is a member of the NN Running Team, said that failing to qualify for the delayed Tokyo Summer Games that were held in 2021 inspired him to work harder and dream big.

Challenges

“At times life teaches you to treat obstacles as challenges to grow…I took it as a ladder to climb to the great heights and here I am going to the Olympics,” said Mateiko, adding that what changed in his training to finally make it was gaining self-belief and confidence. “You can train well but without that you can easily lose.”

NN Running Team also has the likes of the Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge, three-time world half marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor and Olympic and world 1,500m champion Faith Kipyegon.

Mateiko noted that training in the midst of such great athletes has greatly improved his game in terms of tactics and resilience.

“There is nowhere else really you can source out for athletics ' knowledge if not from this group. Of course there are always ups-and-downs but one has to stay focused,” said Mateiko.

Mateiko, who is handled by Patrick Sang said he is hoping for a good collaboration with Kimeli and any other athlete that will be selected to join them.

“We have what it takes to win in Paris. All we need is self-belief, confidence and good tactics. The 2022 world event in Eugene was a good initiation,” said Mateiko.

The National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) president Paul Tergat, who was in Eugene to witness the trials said Kenya has a strong team that can recapture the title they won for the first and last time at the 1968 Mexico Games through the late Naftali Temu.

“We have a great future in Mateiko and Kimeli,” said Tergat, 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Olympics 10,000m silver medallist.

Mateiko was inspired into athletics by his elder sister Valentine, the 2014 world under-20 3,000m bronze medallist.

It’s until Mateiko cleared Form Four in 2016 Moi Boys Kaptama, Mount Elgon that Valentine invited Mateiko to Kaptagat for training where he rented a house for him.

Valentine has established herself as an elite road runner, finishing fourth at the Paris Marathon in April, her last appearance. She was placed second at the Copenhagen Marathon and third at the Istanbul Marathon last year.

Mateiko paced at the London Marathon and Chicago Marathon last year where the late Kelvin Kiptum won in a course record (2:01:25) and world record (2:00:35) respectively.

Eradicate stigma on menstrual hygiene,"Menstrual Hygiene Day was marked to celebrate the importance of menstrual health and break the stigma surrounding menstruation.

It was a day set aside for the society to remember the challenges that women go through as they navigate through the hardships that emanate as a result of menstruation.

Let's ensure every woman and girl has access to the education, products, and facilities they need for safe and dignified menstrual hygiene. Together, we can create a world where menstruation is not a barrier but a natural part of life.

During this journey, women and girls need to be educated on the importance of maintaining a clean environment, both in the surroundings and personal lifestyle in a bid to eradicate some of the setbacks that may accrue as a result of an unhygienic menstrual cycle.

The government, in conjunction with other non-governmental organisations, need to be at the forefront to ensure that menstrual hygiene campaigns reach every woman.

Access to adequate sanitary towels and soaps is also vital even as we fight for this campaign. We've witnessed cases where women are forced to use tissue paper or cloth linen while on their periods due to financial constraints or lack of adequate support to get access to sanitary towels. This has mostly been witnessed in rural areas where the majority of families are given less attention in matters of access to adequate resources.

The government together with well-wishers and NGOs need to identify such areas and act swiftly. We can end the menstrual hygiene stigma. Let us channel our energy towards ensuring that our young women are stigma-free during this process of biological change.

Those found guilty of taking advantage of innocent women in exchange for sanitary towels need to be dealt with accordingly. Let's embrace and walk with women and girls in puberty and give them the necessary support they deserve. They deserve to be treated like any other person.

Let’s applaud him for marketing pan-Africanism and getting the goodies.” His contact is [email protected].

Hustler Wait • President Ruto’s pet project, the ‘Hustler Fund’, no longer works perfectly, laments Amos Wambugu. “After repaying my loan, I applied for a new one and was advised to try again after two hours. This has since been the case for quite some time. To add salt to injury, the short- and long-term savings in the fund are also not accessible.” His email address is [email protected].

The return of Diani's nightlife,"For more than five years, residents and tourists in Diani, Kwale County, have been at risk of attacks due to rising cases of insecurity.

This situation was fueled by a lack of street lights along Diani Beach Road, the town's busiest road.

Diani, a resort town, has been attracting revellers from across the globe, who enjoy the world-class beaches during the day and party at popular joints in the area at night.

In 2023, Diani Beach was named “Africa’s Leading Beach Destination” for the 11th successive time by the World Travel Awards (WTA), stamping its bragging rights as a favourite global tourism destination.

Away from the pristine beaches, popular hangout joints include Full Moon Club, Manyatta Disco, Palmer Club and Tandoori International Club, all situated along Beach Road.

However, criminal gangs engaging in muggings along the streets threatened the town’s glory.

So bad was the situation that residents would start deserting streets when darkness fell, affecting businesses.

Tourists in the 24-hour economy would frequently report attacks and mugging along the road, losing their valuables as they walked.

A spot check by Nation.Africa revealed night activities have resumed after the new streetlights were installed by the Kwale County Government.

Entertainment industry

Tourism stakeholders and those in the entertainment industry have equally lauded the installation of street lights since March this year, saying they are banking on them to boost their businesses further.

Stephen Mure, an entertainment manager at Sisi Kwa Sisi Entertainment Movement, said they now have confidence in organising night events.

He said most of the time, weekday and weekend parties feature invitations from top artists and DJs.

""Our numbers were being affected due to insecurity because many people would not want to show up and leave late after the parties,"" said Mr Mure.

He added that even though the area is now in a low business season, sales and activities will rise further towards the end of July when the peak tourism season begins.

He further urged the county government to ensure all the stretch between Jacaranda Beach Hotel and Neptune Beach Hotel has enough security lights.

Shaban Omar, a resident of Diani, said he is now confident of moving at night without fear of being attacked.

""I can comfortably run my errands or do my shopping at night because there is enough light,"" he said.

Police patrols

Msambweni OCPD Francis Gachoki said the lights also helped police patrol the area.

He, however, said there have not been any reported cases after the street lights.

""We would receive many cases of people being mugged on the road. Due to the dark and forested area, many gangs would hide in the area targeting tourists at night,"" he said.

An earlier solar street lighting project, installed in 2013, was vandalised as thieves stole the panels, solar chargers and bulbs, leaving streets empty and dark.

This limited tourists' movement at night, especially those accessing cottages from entertainment joints. The road also hosts most beach resorts and boutique hotels.

According to the Kwale County CEC for Trade and Tourism Michael Mutua, the move to light the streets was to improve the tourism business, which had been affected by insecurity.

""Normally, tourists want to take a night walk after having dinner. Most of them are also getting attracted to Diani because of the vibrant nightlife,"" he said.

Mutua said the administration would ensure the new solar lights are not vandalised.

""We have so far done 50 poles for about two kilometres which was a hotspot for crime. The design was different because the battery, the solar and the bulb are now fixed together and can hardly be vandalised,"" Mutua said.

He added that the rest of the road will be lit with about 161 poles in phases in the coming financial year on a budget of Sh28 million.

Mutua added that apart from the main road, his department would pave beach access roads with cabro and amenities such as public washrooms.

""We have spoken to some property owners to ensure they also take responsibility and help reduce vandalism of public resources such as street lights,"" said Mutua.

While launching the lights in March, Kwale Governor Fatuma Achani stated that the solar lights will also be a game changer in the transport sector, where bodaboda and tuk-tuks will work round the clock.

‘Muguka’ ban shines spotlight on counties’ clash over resources,"The dispute between Embu and Mombasa counties over the sale and consumption of ‘muguka’ has highlighted growing conflict among devolved units over resources, bringing to light the challenges they face in balancing their own interests with national unity.

On Monday before President William Ruto faulted the ‘muguka’ ban by three coastal counties — Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta — as farmers and traders held protests in Ena, Embu County, more than 550 kilometres from Mombasa which was the first to announce the ban.

Kilifi and Taita-Taveta also joined the fray, fighting the cash crop by linking it to drug abuse.

Across the country, counties are embroiled in fights over resources and boundaries with some of the disagreements turning bloody.

Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir ordered the closure of all ‘muguka’ outlets and directed county officials to enforce the ban with immediate effect, citing negative health effects on the youth.

However, Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire has dismissed the ban, saying ‘muguka’ is not a drug.

“The ‘muguka’ value chain is estimated to contribute approximately Sh22 billion annually to Embu County’s economy. It also contributes close to Sh1 million daily to the Mombasa County economy in transport levies. ‘Muguka’ farmers have invested heavily in the crop and stand to revenue and a source of their livelihoods,” she said.

Former Transition Authority chairperson Kinuthia wa Mwangi has attributed the counties’ fight over resources to the need to increase their own revenue kitties.

He also accuses some governors of overstepping their mandate.

“The Executive Order was a total abuse of constitutional processes as it is not based on any gazetted law as was the case by Mombasa County. It was fiat and discretionary in nature given that it contradicted a national policy, had no standing in law and can be challenged in court,” Mr Mwangi told Nation.Africa.

He explained that there are more than 16 boundary disputes between various counties that are all centred on resources.

Last year, Mombasa County’s plan to tax cargo at the Port of Mombasa ran into legal headwinds after Attorney-General Justin Muturi termed it illegal and unconstitutional.

In an advisory, Mr Muturi said the county had no mandate to impose a levy on goods imported into the country, arguing that the move could undermine national economic policies.

The AG said although the law grants the two levels of government power to impose taxes and charges, it also clearly spells out which distinct areas the two should work within.

Mr Mwangi said county nationalism should also be aligned within the confines of the law.

The former TA chairperson cited section 189 (a) of the Constitution which states, “The government at either level shall perform its functions, and exercise its powers, in a manner that respects the functional and institutional integrity of government at the other level and respects the constitutional status and institutions of government at the other level and, in the case of county government, within the county level.

Section 3 states; “In any dispute between governments, the governments shall make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute, including by means of procedures provided under national legislation.”

“There is a serious danger of derailing devolution from the way it was intended to work should the two levels collide in their functions,” Mr Mwangi said.

Recently, the Environment and Land Court confirmed conservatory orders allowing the County Government of Taita-Taveta to be the sole authority issuing business permits and levying county taxes in the contested Mackinnon Road and Mtito Andei towns.

The towns are contested by Kwale, Makueni and Taita-Taveta counties.

Justice Lucas Naikuni further directed that the Taita-Taveta County Government deposits all revenues it will collect into an interest-earning bank account opened jointly with Kwale and Makueni counties.

The judge also issued an order prohibiting Kwale and Makueni counties and their agents from collecting revenue in any way in Mackinnon and Mtito Andei towns, where their predecessors did not collect revenues before the establishment of county governments.

“I have already set out that the public interests will not be served if this court declines to grant conservatory orders sought, I will exercise this discretion judiciously and grant the petitioner the orders as prayed,” ruled Justice Naikuni.

The orders were issued pending the hearing and determination of a petition filed by Senator Okiya Omtatah relating to boundary disputes between Taita-Taveta, Kwale and Makueni counties.

Mr Omtatah seeks to compel Parliament (National Assembly and Senate) to appoint an independent commission to resolve the simmering boundary disputes between the three counties.

According to the case documents, the disputes have resulted in traders who used to pay taxes to the predecessor of Taita-Taveta County, before counties were established, being forced to pay taxes twice to two different counties. Mr Omtatah also wants the Executive arm of government to survey and erect visible beacons to clearly demarcate the boundaries of all counties with preference being given to Taita-Taveta, Kwale and Makueni counties.

He is seeking a declaration that forcing residents of Mtito Andei and Mackinnon Road towns to pay double taxes is a gross violation of the traders’ rights.

The case will be mentioned on July 2.

Meru and Isiolo have also been embroiled in a boundary tussle since 2013, which is yet to be resolved.

 ,"Every year, Kenyan pilgrims from various corners of the country sacrifice their time, energy and resources to undertake an arduous spiritual journey to Namugongo Shrine in Uganda.

The shrine is where Charles Lwanga, a Ugandan martyr and his companions, who stood firm for their faith - were burned alive following a decree from King Mwanga II of the Buganda Kingdom.

Every year, thousands of Kenyans trek several kilometres to the shrine in Namugongo to mark Uganda Martyrs Day, held on June 3.

Some 500,000 Catholics from Uganda and the rest of Africa troop to the shrine to offer prayers and thanksgiving yearly.

Some pilgrims commence their journey to Namugongo as early as May 1, especially those coming from far-flung regions of the coast of Kenya.

This year, faithful from Malindi, led by Reverend Father Patrick Mudunga, kicked off their journey nearly a month ago.

They will be joined by Catholics from Nyahururu, Kakamega, Bungoma, Kisumu and Busia dioceses as they plan to make it to Namugongo by June 1.

Fr Mudunga says that the pilgrimage is a significant moment for Catholics since it opens doors for blessings.

“This is the time that Christians set aside their time to focus on prayers. It is a spiritual exercise, where they put aside luxury in memory of the Uganda Martyrs,” he said.

Former Assistant Director at the Vincentian Retreat Centre of Entebbe, Fr Michael Louis, notes that the pilgrimage offers the faithful a chance to commemorate the Uganda Martyrs journey in faith.

The walk is relevant in Uganda, given that the first missionaries, Fr Simeon Marpel, alias Maperra, and Brother Amansi, walked preaching the gospel to the locals in Uganda.

Refused to denounce their faith

Charles Lwanga and his companions were among the first converts to the Christian faith in Uganda. They were killed because they refused to denounce their faith.

The first 45 martyrs hailed from a place known as Munyonyo. They were frogmarched to the execution ground in Namugongo.

A total of 22 Roman Catholics and 23 Anglicans died in different places along the way between 1885 and 1887.

“They were first baptised in a shrine in Munyonyo. Next to the shrine is where St Dennis Ssebuggwawo was killed,” said Fr Louis.

Namugongo is the National Shrine of Uganda.

The faithful make prayers nine days before the feast day, marked on June 3.

Before they set off, pilgrims usually notify officials of the churches where they would make stopovers of their camping plans.

While some prefer walking during the day and resting at night, others opt to trek at night and rest during the day.

The faithful usually walk in a formation where a leader carrying a crucifix opens the way, followed by members, and those with the church’s and the country’s flags bring the rear.

Josephine Apondi, a faithful residing in Kisumu, has been undertaking the pilgrimage since 2014.

She says that faithful starting their journey from Kisumu make nine stopovers in parishes before reaching Namugongo.

They would spend a night in Yala and Ugunja in Siaya County before proceeding to Busia for their third night.

While in Uganda, they will make another six stopovers before they arrive at Namugongo.

Arrive at the shrine

“We usually start on May 22 and by June 1 we arrive at the shrine,” she explains.

On May 30, there’s usually a Holy Mass celebrated at Mabira Forest to celebrate the lives of five Kenyan pilgrims killed by speeding taxis on May 31, 1998, and May 26, 2019.

Kenyan pilgrims have made it a tradition to pray for the souls of their departed colleagues.

“On that day thousands gather in the forest early in the morning to celebrate the life of John Kibe and his companions who were killed in an accident,” says Ms Apondi.

The pilgrims arrive at Namugongo on June 1 and rest for a day as they wait for the celebration of the feast on June 3.

Martyrs Day is considered a public event in Uganda.

From Fr Louis’s experience, while taking a walk from Entebbe to Namugongo in 2023, he said he felt the power of martyrdom.

“We were six individuals. We started our journey at 3pm, walked throughout the night till 3am when we finally arrived at Namugongo,” he recalls.

“In the walk, there are many healings taking place because of the prayers that are offered during the journey. There was a particular lady who had health issues and walked from Kasese to Namugongo and got healed.”

Fr Louis says that many faithful have attested to experience a sense of peace and holiness whenever they tour the shrine to offer prayers.

Forgiveness and salvation

“Often we use our legs to go to a place to commit sin. So when we walk for a good course once in a year it will definitely bring grace, forgiveness and salvation to our lives,” said Fr Louis.

Henry Onyango, a Kisumu resident, says he experienced a breakthrough after going to the Namugongo Shrine to pray for his brother, who had a crisis at work.

“I had quite an interesting experience last year in June. I went to the shrine with a prayer request for my brother who had issues at his workplace with his bosses. When I got back to Kisumu, he told me the issue had been sorted out and he got a promotion at his workplace,” says Mr Onyango.

Vincent Owuor Otieno, another faithful from Kisumu, says he has visited the shrine six times. Four times before Covid-19 and twice after the pandemic.

He first went in 2011 with a group of friends while in college. Otieno draws inspiration from the youngest martyr, St Kizito, who was courageous enough to die for his faith.

“How thousands come to the place tells a lot about the powerful intercession of the Uganda Martyrs. Every year I have made it a tradition to go to the shrine and it has cemented my faith and spirituality,” said Mr Otieno.

After the three days of prayer and supplication, the faithful are free to leave the shrine for their home countries, only that this time around, they can ride on vehicles.

Parliamentary committee pledges justice for murdered Agnes Wanjiru,"The unexplained death of Agnes Wanjiru and delayed compensation for the 2021 Lolldaiga wildfire dominated the first public hearings into the conduct of the British Army Training in Kenya (Batuk), which began on Tuesday.

The National Assembly's Defence, Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committee has embarked on a three-day exercise in Laikipia and Samburu counties, where locals have been invited to give their views on incidents of human rights abuses and alleged ethical breaches by British soldiers.

Committee chairman Nelson Koech led his team in gathering views from the affected communities where foreign troops conduct their military training.

The team will then produce a report that will feed into a review of the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) between Kenya and the UK, which is renewed every five years.

The family of Agnes Wanjiru, who was allegedly killed by a British soldier in 2012, accused the Kenyan authorities of not doing enough to help them get justice.

""For more than 10 years since my aunt was killed, not a single Kenyan government official has given us a firm assurance that the culprit, who was well known, will be prosecuted. Agnes' daughter, who is now almost a teenager, is traumatised because she already knows that her mother was killed by British soldiers,"" Esther Njoki, a niece of the late Agnes, told the committee at Nanyuki Social Hall.

Njoki urged the committee to take the issue seriously and remove all hurdles that have delayed the prosecution of the culprit to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

Mr Koech described the unsolved murder of Wanjiru as a huge problem that had contributed to delaying the signing of the DCA by a year after his committee had demanded that it be resolved first.

Unfortunate incident

""We take this issue very seriously and that is why we are here. It was an unfortunate incident and we will ensure that the culprit is prosecuted because murder is a very serious crime. That is why we have proposed a clause in the DCA that foreigners who commit crimes here will be prosecuted by a Kenyan court,"" said the chairman.

Laikipia East MP Mwangi Kiunjuri, who accompanied the Koech-led committee, said he would mobilise his colleagues in Parliament to come up with laws to ensure that foreigners who commit crimes in Kenya face the law locally.

Mr Kiunjuri accused the British government of discriminating against locals on compensation, noting that the owner of the Lolldaiga farm had been compensated but the victims of the fire were yet to receive their pay more than two years later.

More than 5,000 people living near Lolldaiga Ranch went to court to claim compensation for damage to their health and environment caused by toxic smoke from the March 2021 fire.

""We understand that both the ranch owner and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) have been compensated. Why is the community that suffered the adverse effects of the toxic smoke from the wildfire yet to receive their dues?"" asked Mr Kiunjuri.

The parliamentary committee also heard of alleged discrimination in employment opportunities at Batuk Nyatti Barracks in Nanyuki, while local traders and investors complained of dwindling business opportunities, claiming that suppliers were being sourced from outside the county.

Other issues of concern raised during the public hearings held at Jua Kali Centre and Nanyuki Town on Tuesday included unexploded ordnance on the training grounds and unfavourable employment procedures for casual labourers and other staff at Nanyuki Nyatti Barracks.

Mr Koech and his committee will visit Archers Post Township in Samburu County on Wednesday before heading to Doldol Town in Laikipia on Thursday for further public engagements.

Advise! I fear losing my older girlfriend,"I am in a relationship with a woman from my village. She completes her nursing course in a few months. I plan to marry her as soon as possible.

My worry is whether we are a good match. Will she wait for me since I have a year to complete high school? She has promised to care for me and help me with my college fees. She is older by three years.

Will this work? I love her so much, and, at times, I fear we might lose each other. Kindly advise.

Hi

Relationships are based on knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. You should know what it means to be in a relationship and a marriage.

What brings you together? Infatuation is great but it will not hold a relationship together. You must be able to answer, “Why do I feel attracted to her and feel she is the right one? Where is she headed in life?”

Remember that by the time she completes college, you will be finishing high school or starting college.

Marrying her while in college and she is working will not only be an unwise idea but is a decision that will stress your relationship.

For example, who will pay your college fees, housing, and care for your upkeep and a baby if this happens sooner than expected? I am worried whether you are attracted to each other for the right reasons.

Enduring relationships are based on clearly knowing each other’s dreams and aspirations.

As much as you love her, let some facts speak for themselves.

First, you are still in high school and have no job yet. Second, both of you will find marriage responsibilities difficult and stressful.

Third, your responsibilities as a married man will interfere with your future dreams.

And finally, since you are yet to qualify for marriage, I suggest you concentrate on your studies, for now.

Take the necessary precaution

Relationships are not only about knowledge but also understanding. Are you aware of the consequences of the choice you would like to make?

As I implied earlier, finances play a significant role in any relationship because they help a family meet their basic needs.

I can authoritatively state that the pressure to meet the bills has caused many relationships to break apart.

In some cases, poor choices can lead to violence. With violence comes the separation of the family. Her words of committing to support you are noble but can be far from reality.

I don’t doubt her ability, but caution that promises are wishes to be tested. Your fear of the future is valid.

At times, fears are good at helping us take the necessary precautions.

However, a guaranteed marriage is based on wisdom that seeks to evaluate and understand all things in light of the facts and realities of life.

Avoid being drawn to each as a result of temporal things or desires. As far as age is concerned, it may never be an issue so long as the two are of acceptable age and can handle what it takes to build a strong and tested marriage.

You should put off any marriage plans and pursue your career. If she marries someone else, move on. You are still young.

Focus on building a career

Your future depends on the choices you make now. Don’t sell your future for a marriage you are not ready for.

Recall that young people who have experienced sexual intimacy may get swept away by a romance that does not guarantee them the life they had hoped for.

Additionally, I am sure that you have parents taking care of you. Listen to them. The wisdom of the elderly corrects the mistakes we might make now and in the future.

Do not dispose of their wisdom and guidance just because they are not of your age.

Redefine your future based on wise goals to create a pleasurable and honourable life. Many have rushed and regretted their choices. As the proverb “Hurry hurry has no blessing” goes, there is no urgency here.

The future ahead is bright, based on the right choices.

Avoid making promises, and set each other free to get into a stable career. If both of you will be available, solidify your dating into marriage.

As you focus on building a career, establish clear boundaries. You will need to reaffirm your commitment to achieving your desired career goals.

Maturity demands that friends respect each other’s choices and commitments.

Relationships swing those involved from one emotional state to another. However, a lack of self-control undermines our sense of judgment and kills our future dreams. Self-control keeps us grounded to make informed and well-thought-through decisions.

Think thrice before falling into adultery,"In her track, How Could an Angel Break My Heart, Toni Braxton sings: “I heard he sang a lullaby. I heard he sang it from his heart. When I found out, I thought I would die. Because that lullaby was mine.”

There is nothing as painful in a marriage as finding out that your spouse has been unfaithful. It does not matter how much the cheater justifies this level of betrayal or sanitises it. It speaks of their character more than anything else they can ever do to their betrayed partner.

Next to domestic violence, adultery is a betrayal that wounds so deeply that your spouse’s worldview, perception, and beliefs are altered, because of you.

When adultery and abuse happen simultaneously, a person is left so wounded that they must dig into their supernatural strength to survive it.

Read: Stop listening to those negative marriage stories

“Adultery is a betrayal that hurts deeper than a knife wound.” *Loice says. “It causes trauma and momentary insanity.” Adultery brings to the fore abandonment concerns, it makes you feel faint, angry, and murderous, but mostly, breaks your heart and faith in humanity.

I know that sounds dramatic. But ask those who have lived through it.

“I felt broken. I felt…worthless, a lesser man.” *Andrew Majuma says when he discovered his wife of 12 years was involved in an affair.

Remain faithful

When the one who vowed to desert all others and remain faithful, loving, and protective of you steps out behind your back, you land on your face, belly, and heart on the floor.

Even jumping off a cliff does not feel as hurtful or dramatic. When you have been faithful to them, blissfully trusting that they too were, you are stunned, shocked, and disoriented that they could so easily betray your trust and break the vows of fidelity.

Infidelity trauma causes a myriad of reactions in the victim, including feeling worthless, numb, angry, humiliated, depression, intrusive thoughts about the affair and so much more. It cuts deep, especially when committed by a so-called Christian spouse.

Read: I want to stop cheating and be a better man

This is because we hold them on a pedestal. We assume they meant every vow of fidelity, love, and honour they declared in the presence of more than 500 souls. But human nature is so often deceitful that we must let people earn our trust instead of giving it away simply because they made a vow.

As devastating as it is, you can recover. Therapy, long walks, times in isolation, copious bottles of wine to boot, but one day, as you are busy doing your mundane work, a light will flutter.

You will not even be sure that it is a spark. “Maybe an electrical fault.” You will tell yourself. But the light will not go out. If anything, it will continue flickering, growing, building, and one morning, you will wake up feeling lighter.

The world will look beautiful again. You will notice the red Nandi flame, whose vibrancy compliments the Jacaranda in bloom. You will smile at strangers, say, “Excuse me,” and “Pole” when you bump into each other in the streets.

Then, love will find you from the blues and when you were not expecting or looking. Time does not cure heartbreak. Love does. Your tears will dry. This person will make you laugh, without trying. They will make you smile.

You will find yourself watching the rain and dreaming about fireplaces, companionship, and ageing together. Maybe you are lonely after being betrayed and neglected, but who cares? This person feeds you the best medicine, laughter.

Read: My wife thinks I cheated on her

They become your accountability partner, in your healing journey and the pursuit of your dreams, your purpose.

They complement your curves, which you thought were the reason that your ex-spouse chose to cheat. But now you know better that someone committing adultery is their personal choice and has nothing to do with you.

Think twice, thrice even, before stepping out on your spouse. Unless you are a narcissist and are incapable of empathy, you do not want to be the source of the kind of pain for the mother or father of your children.

Yes, karma too does come around. She does not flinch. She metes out vengeance with glee.

Haiti transition council taps former PM Garry Conille to lead the country,"Haiti's transition council on Tuesday tapped former Prime Minister Garry Conille, who briefly led the country over a decade ago, to return to the role as the Caribbean nation works to restore stability and take back control from violent gangs.

The transition council voted 6-1 to install Conille as interim prime minister, a member told Reuters.

Conille's extensive resume in development, working largely with the United Nations, is considered key to shoring up international support as Haiti prepares to launch a UN-backed security mission led by Kenya, though its deployment has faced hurdles.

The transition council, which holds some presidential powers, and its head, Edgard Leblanc, acting as a de-facto president, are now tasked with holding elections before February 7, 2026, as laid out in Haiti's constitution.

""Following discussions within the transition council after hearings with the candidates for prime minister, Dr. Garry Conille was chosen by consensus to lead the government during this transition period,"" Leblanc said on X.

Conille's naming underscores progress in Haiti's political process and follows Prime Minister Ariel Henry's resignation in March after he left Haiti to seek support for the Kenyan security mission and was unable to re-enter the country.

President Jovenel Moise, who named Henry, was assassinated in 2021. Haiti has not had a president since.

""My sincerest congratulations,"" business leader Alix Didier Fils-Aime, who had also put his hat in the ring for the role, said on X. ""I'm still a patriot who believes in this country. Long live Haiti!""

Conille was prime minister for just seven months, resigning in February 2012 after losing the support of his cabinet and clashing with then-President Michel Martelly.

Conille and Martelly butted heads over reconstruction contracts following a deadly 2010 earthquake and a parliamentary investigation into politicians holding dual citizenship, which is illegal in Haiti.

Conille most recently held the post of regional director at U.N. children's agency Unicef.

He will now be tasked with fighting off rampant insecurity as gangs have expanded their reach.

More than 360,000 people are already internally displaced within Haiti, according to UN estimates, mostly from capital Port-au-Prince, due to the gang conflict.

Beatrice Chebet pays tribute to Ethiopia’s Tsegay,"World-great stories about middle and long-distance races in athletics can’t be complete without Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes.

Athletes from these two neighbouring countries have pushed each to great length and height, and as a result, world, championship and national records have tumbled.

From the days of Paul Tergat and Haile Gebrselassie in the late 90s and early 2000s to the trilogy of Vivian Cheruiyot, Tirunesh Dibaba and Meseret Defar - the two nations have given the sport endless memories.

Who can forget the battle between Olympic and world 1,500m champion Faith Kipyegon and former 1,500m world record holder Genzebe Dibaba that left fans on the edge of their seats?

Read: AK to select 10,000m Olympics team in USA

That story won’t end soon with Kipyegon, the current 1,500m world record holder, upholding her supremacy with the multi-world champion Beatrice Chebet and world 10,000m champion Gudaf Tsegay from Ethiopia joining the fray.

Chebet and Tsegay took their supremacy battle to the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League on Saturday in Eugene, United States, this time around, in the 10,000m race.

They say revenge is best served cold.

However, Chebet doesn’t think so after beating Tsegay to set a new 10,000m world record of 28 minutes and 54.14 seconds, making history as the first woman to break the 29-minute barrier over the distance.

Chebet erased the previous time of 29:01.03 set by Letesenbet Gidey from Ethiopia on June 8 last year in Hengelo, the Netherlands.

It’s at the Prefontaine Classic where Tsegay beat Chebet to second place and set a new 5,000m world record of 14:00.21 last year, where the Kenyan improved her personal best to 14:05.92.

Chebet, the 5km world record holder, has paid glowing tribute to Tsegay for playing a vital role in her success over the last two years.

“It wasn’t about revenge and rivalry painted negatively. We are best of buddies and we always try to help each other whether from Ethiopia, Kenya or somewhere else,” said Chebet, adding that Tsegay powered her to a world record-breaking feat at Prefontaine.

“Running with Gudaf makes me work hard to produce the best in me and Saturday's moments were no exception,” explained Chebet, the reigning Commonwealth Games 5,000m champion.

Chebet detailed how she faced Tsegay at the 2022 Zurich Diamond League final in a 5,000m race, where she won in 14:32, edging out the Ethiopian to third place in 14:33. They would again face off in the London Diamond League in July last year, where Tsegay had the final laugh, winning in 14:12.29 as Chebet settled second in a career-best 14:12.92.

Tsegay again beat Chebet to second place in 5,000m at the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League final last year, where she shattered Kipyegon’s three-month-old world record of 14:05.20 from Paris with a new time of 14:00.21.

“Facts don’t lie…I have improved my times in 5,000m and 10,000m because of Gudaf, who pushes me to the limit. We push each other to produce the best in athletics,” said Chebet, who had not planned to break the world record in Oregon.

‘Cornered’ Hit Squad fights for survival in Paris Olympics qualifiers,"Kenya’s “Hit Squad” hopes of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics hang in the hands of two boxers at the 2024 Boxing Second World Qualification Tournament in Bangkok.

The ‘Hit Squad’ only have three bouts left in the event being held at Indoor Huamark Stadium.

The dangling hope is in women’s 66kg - welterweight - where rookie Friza Anyango faces Sonvico Emille (France), while Peter Abuti - another newcomer in the global ring - will face the winner of round 32, pitting Polish Mateusz Bereznick against Australian Adrian Paolletti on Thursday in the 92kg - heavyweight category.

Martha Amina (bantamweight) was due to fight Mongolian Munguntsetseg En Khjargal in the Round of 32 Tuesday last evening.

The ""Hit Squad"" members who have exited the tournament include 75kg-middleweight Elizabeth Andiego, 80kg-light-heavyweight Edwin Okong’o and deputy captain Boniface Mogunde.

Qualification opportunities are dwindling by the day as the second World Qualification Tournament enters the home stretch.

Not even the training in Cuba, one of the boxing powerhouses in the history of the Olympic Games, could salvage the image of ""Hit Squad.""

Cuban boxers have clinched 41 Olympic gold medals in the Olympics. Only the Americans have won more (50). Cuban boxers have collected 78 Olympic medals in boxing, emerging as the nation with the third most podium finishes.

After a disastrous outing at Dakar, Senegal, last September and at the first World Qualification Tournament in Busto Arsizio, Italy, there is no reprieve for the ""Hit Squad"" in Bangkok.

Bangkok offered Kenyan boxers a final chance to secure a quota for the Olympic Games Paris 2024.

When the ""Hit Squad"" arrived in Bangkok, president of the Boxing Federation of Kenya (BFK) Anthony “Jamal” Ombok, who was accompanying the team, said they were razor sharp and ready for second-world Olympics qualifiers.

Jamal described the elimination of Okong’o and Andiego as a “sad day for the Hit Squad.""

German Irina Nicoletta Schoenberger defeated Andiego with a resounding 5:0 unanimous decision on Monday.

The German will face Mexico’s Citlalli Vanessa Ortiz, also known as “Bellatrix,” who outclassed her opponent from New Zealand, Deanne Shontel te-paea Read, in the Round of 16 today.

Okong’o lost on points to Dalai Ganzorig of Mongolia in the Round of 32 in the light-heavyweight on Monday.

“We gave our best shot,” Jamal, who was elected BFK president in 2019, posted on his Facebook page.

Robert Napunyi Wangila (welterweight) and Chris Sande (middleweight) won gold and bronze medals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

Philip Waruinge took bronze in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and silver in the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Ibrahim Bilali (lightweight) won bronze in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, while Dick Murunga (welterweight) clinched a bronze in the 1972 Olympics in Munich.

How caretaker’s bid to take over his German employer’s building failed,"A man who had attempted to short-change his employer by claiming ownership of his property has suffered a setback after the Court of Appeal okayed his eviction from a building he was occupying illegally in Malindi.

Mr Amin Mohamed Hamid, whom Mr Werner Sebastian had hired to look after his house, had tried to prevent the German national from evicting him by claiming that he had a share in the property and would incur significant losses if kicked out.

He requested the court to issue stay orders to protect his interests while awaiting the outcome of an appeal he plans to file against his eviction. However, the Court of Appeal rejected this request, stating that Mr Hamid did not adequately justify his application.

Justices Agnes Murgor, George Odunga, and Kibaya Laibuta said they were not convinced Mr Hamid’s planned appeal would become meaningless if the stay orders were not issued.

“Insofar as the applicant’s case is anchored on the claim that he expended substantial sums of money to undertake improvements on the property, any sums, if found due, would be recoverable,” said the judges.

Malindi Estates Limited

The case goes back to 2005 when Mr Sebastian bought the property from Malindi Estates Limited and registered it in his name. The foreigner then built a two-bedroomed house on the ground floor where he lived and two additional houses — two-bedroomed and one-bedroomed units — on the first floor.

He then travelled back to his home country, leaving Mr Hamid to look after the property.

The court record shows that sometime in 2013, Mr Hamid cautioned Mr Sebastian to never return to Kenya due to an alleged warrant of arrest which had been issued against him.

“When I returned to Kenya in 2015, I found that Mr Hamid had rented out the property to third parties,” he told the court.

The German then moved to court to ask for various orders including that Mr Hamid and his tenants vacate the premises and a permanent injunction be issued to block them from entering or interfering with his property.

He also asked for an annulment of an agreement that Mr Hamid had entered into alongside other orders for payment of damages.

Mr Hamid denied Mr Sebastian’s claim but admitted that the foreigner was the owner of the property and that he built the ground floor of the house.

But, according to Mr Hamid, he is the one who completed the first floor after Mr Sebastian had given it to him as a gift.

The defendant further filed a counterclaim, asking the court to issue an injunction preventing Mr Sebastian and his agents from accessing, occupying or in any manner interfering with his enjoyment of the property.

Refund any amounts owed

“The foreigner, his agents or assigns be compelled to unconditionally restore my water pipes and make good any other loss that he illegally caused to be occasioned or removed from the two houses built on the first floor of the building,” he said. Mr Hamid asked the court to recognise an agreement relating to the two houses constructed on the first floor of the building and dated October 15, 2013, as a valid and legally enforceable contract.

Environment and Land Court judge Millicent Odeny had initially ruled in favour of Mr Sebastian in a judgment issued in November 2023. Mr Hamid is, however, aggrieved with this decision and wants the Court of Appeal to overturn it.

In his appeal, Mr Hamid has faulted Justice Odeny, arguing that she erred in law and fact by considering matters that she ought not to have considered and overlooking the material he had placed before her.

In their decision to reject a request for stay orders by the appellant, the Court of Appeal judges also took into account Mr Sebastian’s offer to refund any amounts owed to Mr Hamid.

Additionally, they noted that the foreigner’s ownership of the property is undisputed and Mr Hamid’s occupation stems from his role as a caretaker.

“Mr Hamid’s claim that he invested Sh300,000 in the alleged development of the first floor would, if found to be due, be recoverable in a claim for special damages. Indeed, it would not be difficult to recover such sums in the event that its appeal succeeded,” said the judges.

Humanitarian crisis: Samburu families displaced by banditry struggle for survival,"Agnes Leshikuya's face bears a dry smile, betraying the anguish she has undergone in the last three months.

Jostling for space in a makeshift shelter during the heavy afternoon rain, she finds room for some of her children while others brave the downpour.

""This is not our wish. We have been pushed to the walls by these criminals, bandits and cattle rustlers,"" Leshikuya says, her voice breaking.

She then wraps her one-year-old child in a Maasai shuka, grateful to be alive after an escape from Soit Pus village in Samburu County three months ago.

""Bullets ricocheted daily. Let me say they (bullets) were just raining. I was very lucky to escape alive together with my children,"" she recounts of the bandit attack that forced her out of her home, where she lost hundreds of livestock.

Approaching the Nkabaai area, the crowd appears like a marketplace, but closer inspection reveals internally displaced families totalling close to 300 constructing makeshift shelters.

The people were forced to flee from their villages and are now seeking safety at the Nkabaai Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp after bandits ransacked and burnt adjacent villages.

But even here, the likes of Leshikuya lament abandonment by the government.

“We eat but not every day and we are not even sure of where it will come from. But we eat,"" she says.

Endemic poverty and heavy rains compound the insecurity for these vulnerable people, and road-daylight attacks have become routine despite intensified security operations by police backed by the military.

Now, a humanitarian crisis looms as more people flee bandit hotspots, with hundreds of learners out of school after closures due to banditry. Four schools remain shut despite learners in other counties continuing with learning.

Locals told Nation.Africa the government should resettle them and provide them with relief food and other material interventions.

""We are law abiding citizens. We have already been displaced, and also others have just been told to vacate. Please, let the government resettle us,"" said James Lenaseyian.

Samburu County Commissioner John Cheruiyot insists on relative calm and government efforts to eliminate banditry.

The administrator said the government had already deployed enough security personnel, including the National Police Reservists (NPRs), to patrol and beef up security in the area.

""There are no alarming cases, and therefore there is no need to fear. We have our security officers patrolling the areas. I urge parents to take children to school without fear,"" Cheruiyot said.

Samburu Woman Representative Pauline Lenguris said that the insecurity in the region had reduced hardworking pastoralists to unimaginable poverty levels.

Lenguris said that the locals live in unsanitary conditions and urgently need food and non-food items.

""These are hardworking Kenyans confined here unwillingly. They have been pushed to unimaginable poverty levels because their animals were recently driven away by armed bandits,"" said Lenguris, adding that the activities of banditry have disrupted farming, pastoralism, the main occupation of the people in Samburu West parts of Samburu North.

President William Ruto recently ordered the deployment of military officers to rehabilitate classes destroyed by bandits, assuring parents of security for all learners and institutions in the troubled North Rift region.

The government is preparing an aggressive aerial operation to combat armed bandits in Kenya's North Rift region counties of Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Turkana, West Pokot and Laikipia.

For the first time, police will utilize sophisticated gunship helicopters to enhance their capacity against banditry and complex crimes.

Three weeks ago, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki announced that these helicopters, equipped with advanced surveillance and firepower, aim to give security forces an edge over bandits who exploit the rough terrains for attacks and evasion.

""The decision to acquire gunship helicopters stems from the need to bolster security forces' capabilities in dealing with highly organised and heavily armed bandit groups,"" said CS Kindiki. The helicopters are expected to be particularly effective in Malaso in Samburu and Mkogodo Forest in Baringo.

He spoke at the Mombasa Port after flagging off the second batch of 10 Armoured Personnel Carriers for the police service.

"High Court in Embu suspends muguka ban in Mombasa, Kilifi counties","The Mombasa and Kilifi governors were dealt a big blow after the Embu High Court stopped them from implementing their executive orders which banned the sale and transportation of Muguka in their regions. The case was heard on Tuesday, May 28.

The move followed the application by Kutherema Muguka Sacco and Embu County Assembly which sought conservatory orders to bar the two governors from enforcing the ban imposed on Muguka trade.

Justice Lucy Njuguna issued the conservatory orders, restraining the respondents or their agents from interfering with the Muguka trade at the coast.

She said the Court was satisfied that the application should be treated with the urgency it deserved.

She ruled that the executive orders issued on May, 22 should be shelved until July 8 when the suit will be heard interpartes.

The Judge directed that the governors be served with conservatory order papers within seven days.

Following the directive Muguka farmers celebrated, saying justice had been done.

""We welcome the conservatory orders, it is a win on our side,"" one of the farmers said at Muraru Muguka Market in Mbeere South.

Earlier the farmers had lamented that the move had messed up their business and vowed to fight until the Mombasa Governor Abduliswamad Sharif Nassir and his Kilifi counterpart revoked the ban.

Meanwhile, Governors from Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta have agreed to take part in talks led by the Agriculture Ministry on the trade of muguka.

This was after a phone call with President William Ruto, State House said.

“President William Ruto on Tuesday had a phone conversation with Governors of Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta counties on their concerns in the sale of muguka. The three Governors agreed to participate in a meeting of stakeholders to be convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock this week,” said a statement posted on the President’s social media platforms.

The call was a follow-up to a session on Monday between President Ruto and the leadership of Embu County led by the Governor.

“We agreed subsequently to convene a meeting of political leaders of the affected Counties next week,” explained the President.

Police hunt for suspects who murdered Mbita boda boda rider and raped his wife,"Police in Mbita, Homa Bay County, are hunting suspects linked to the murder of a boda boda rider whose wife was also raped during the attack.

The criminals are said to have abandoned a motorcycle they stole from the rider before going into hiding.

The incident happened at Got Rateng B village in the Nyamaji East sub-location at 4am on Tuesday.

According to Lambwe East Sub-location Chief Bernard Onditi, the criminals raided the rider's house where they carried out the attack.

He said the gang wanted to steal money from the rider that well-wishers had donated to help him buy a new motorcycle after an earlier robbery.

""One of his motorcycles was stolen by unknown persons and he was left with the old one,"" Mr Onditi said. His colleagues heard about his misfortune and decided to help him buy a new one.

""He did not buy another motorcycle immediately but decided to repair the old one. It seems the criminals were after the money,"" the chief said. Mr Onditi said the rider was sleeping with his wife when the gang stormed their house.

The horseman was hacked while his wife was raped. Mr Onditi said the woman had recently given birth and was still recovering.

Died while receiving treatment

""She had a five-day-old baby,"" the administrator said.

The boda boda rider died while receiving treatment at the Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital.

His wife was also taken to the hospital for treatment. Mr Onditi said a resident found the stolen motorcycle abandoned in a thicket.

The resident also recovered a mobile phone belonging to the deceased. Mbita sub-county police commander Solomon Barng'etuny confirmed the incident and said a team of officers had been deployed to investigate.

The body of the deceased is at the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting post-mortem examination.

Last week, a group of boda boda riders asked police to step up night patrols in the town, claiming that a vicious gang of criminals was targeting them.

Homa Bay Town boda boda chairman Richard Opiyo said they had lost five motorcycles to criminals in the past month.

""Our only hope is in the hands of the police,"" the rider said.

African-American wants court to grant him Kenyan citizenship by ancestry,"An African-American who is seeking to be recognised as a Kenyan citizen by ancestry, has claimed that he suffered name-calling when he lived in the US.

While testifying before a Mombasa court, Mr Mubarak Abdul Muqsit Akram said since his childhood and into adulthood while in the US, he and his family were called “coloured people” among other derogatory names.

Mr Akram wants the court to order State authorities to issue him a Kenyan citizenship.

He says he chose to settle in Kenya because he feels it is close to him, adding that Kenyans are good people.

“I have chosen Kenya and not other countries. My choice of Kenya as my ancestral home is informed by the fact that modern-day Kenya was part of the larger African territory from where my descendants were forcibly caught and enslaved to America,” says Mr Akram.

Mr Akram, who was testifying before Justice Olga Sewe, added that Kenya is closer to the Red Sea where he can cross over and visit holy sites.

He explained that his parents were African-American and not Caucasian, as such he believes he has an inalienable right to return to his motherland and ancestral home, which is in Africa.

“I’m gainfully employed and not seeking any compensation from Kenya. I request a Kenyan identity card and passport. I am not a refugee,” Mr Akram told Justice Sewe.

He says that, cognisant of his roots and heritage in the African continent, he visited Kenya briefly for the first time in 2003 and later returned in 2008, and ever since, he has found solace, warmth and comfort albeit as a “foreigner”.

The petitioner is seeking a declaration that under the rules of international law and the Constitution, his right to return to his ancestral home and the choice of Kenya as his country of return is guaranteed and ought to be protected by the State.

National Identity Card

Mr Akram also seeks an order that the Director of Immigration and Citizen Services be directed to within 30 days of the judgment, recognise him as a Kenyan citizen and issue him with a passport and National Identity Card as a right.

The petitioner says he has made several applications for registration as a Kenyan citizen to the Department of Immigration but has never received any response.

Mr Akram says he was born in the state of Texas in 1946 to African-American parents and that since his return to Kenya in 2008, he has established and registered several businesses which he runs from his operating base in Kwale County.



The petitioner, who holds a foreigner certificate, has sued the Cabinet Secretary for Interior, Department of Immigration and Citizen Services Director-General and the Attorney General.

Upon cross-examination by lawyer James Kemei for the AG, Mr Akram told the court that the Immigration Department issued him with a foreign certificate.

Legal and justifiable claim

Assistant Director of Immigration Services Ronnie Akedi, in his replying affidavit, states that the petitioner’s belief and conviction that Kenya is his motherland is misplaced and ill-advised.

“There is no probable justification as to how the petitioner has singled out Kenya, out of 54 African countries, as being the country where his descendants’ origins emanate way before the partition of Africa into modern-day states,” says Mr Akedi, adding that the petitioner’s investing in the country does not in itself present criteria for one to be registered as a citizen.

Mr Akedi says the petition does not disclose any legal and justifiable claim against the respondents and that it ought to be dismissed.

According to the petitioner, his choice of Kenya as his ancestral home is anchored in and informed by the provisions of The Abuja Proclamation — a declaration of the Pan African Conference on reparations for African enslavement, colonisation and neo-colonisation, which was sponsored by the African Union held in Nigeria in April 1993.

The petitioner says that among the provisions of the proclamation was a declaration calling upon all African states “to grant entrance as of right to all persons of African descent and right to obtain residence in those African states if there is no disqualifying element on African claiming the right to return to his ancestral home”.

Hearing resumes on June 12.

Sende Moto: Inside an estate's struggle for a blessing,"To a stranger visiting Engineer Town in Nyandarua County for the first time, learning about Sende Moto estate might be shocking.

The estate’s name is notorious for its reputation for crime, prostitution and other illicit activities.

Of concern is that it has been a thorn in the flesh of law enforcers in the Kinangop area and is infamous for prostitution, murders, rape and being a notorious criminal hideout.

Locals, however, view the name as routine and unremarkable and having grown up there and knowing it since childhood, it's no big deal. The area is also well known for all the wrong reasons, including brothels and illicit brews.

Despite Sende Moto’s proximity to the Engineer Police Station and sub-County headquarters, it remains a headache for law enforcement officers.

“It is not unusual to hear someone shout in the streets that they are heading to Sende Moto, or identifying a person living there by that name. This is similar to how residents of big cities proudly identify with their urban dwelling,” says Joy Gachiri, a resident.

Previous attempts to cleanse the area have been in vain, as have been efforts by religious leaders to rename the area from Sende Moto to Kirathimo (blessings).

There is a common belief that ""the only thing one can't find at Sende Moto is life, but you can lose one there.”

Mugo Nyakerie, a resident, describes the place as a ""carefree world, where patrons can enjoy their life without fear. Things that happen there remain a guarded secret, whether they are done during the day or under the cover of darkness.""

Mugo told Nation.Africa he lost his property due to the estate's alluring lifestyle. He owned a shop and a plot within Engineer Town but took refuge in alcohol due to domestic squabbles.

He ended up selling the land in Sende Moto during one of the drinking sprees.

""This place is a comfort zone for anyone looking for peace, and you will get all the happiness you need. Most of those who have lost property were swindled by twilight girls and were easily lured by the cheap life at Sende Moto. Deals involving illicit land, vehicles, and other transactions are sealed at Sende Moto. Men have lost their property, and families have been auctioned since their property was sold and deals were sealed at Sende Moto. One can always get drunk with or without money,” he said.

Cleansing prayers

In November 2019, the clergy began cleansing the place with prayer sessions and anointments.

But Sende Moto has remained.

Bishop Mbuthia Njoroge, who led another clergy in cleansing the area, said the estate had destroyed families, with many men selling their land without family consent.

""The estate had also swallowed many businesses both small and prominent. By the word of prayer and confessions, we are never going to hear of murders, defilement, and rape incidents in this estate. Our youth, men, and women are going to change,"" said Bishop Mbuthia, who also chairs the local pastors' lobby.

However, Ms Gachiri believes that the cleansing by the clergy needs sustained efforts.

""We are talking of a community lifestyle, a lifestyle they have enjoyed for decades, some of them were born there. We can't change the name of a place before understanding that community, their lifestyle, and why they have accepted the lifestyle as a means of life. The change needed to start with reforming the residents, getting them alternative means of living,"" said the businesswoman.

She adds that life is affordable at Sende Moto, such that with Sh100, one will feed, get drunk, and enjoy cheap sex.

“It's only at Sende Moto where you can have a meal at Sh10 or Sh20, a cup of soup retails at Sh10, and a toast at Sh10, that is enough lunch for low-income earners. Most of the meals retail at Sh20 at Sende Moto, why would anyone leave such an affordable lifestyle without a better alternative? You can get a piece of meat at Sh10, but you don’t have to ask what animal it is or where it came from, that is why it's impossible for things to change at Sende Moto,” explained Ms Gachiri.

Cheaper housing

Rental houses are also affordable at Sende Moto, with monthly rent between Sh300 and Sh500.

Senior Chief Magdalene Kariuki shares these sentiments and notes that things have improved since the mass closure of bars in the area.

“We did everything to change the lifestyle, we had many prayer sessions and anointments but things have remained the same. All the bars in that estate were closed down, but we have a challenge because that is where most of the commercial sex workers reside. Unfortunately, most of them are not from Engineer Town, they come from neighbouring Laikipia and Nakuru counties, and some are from very far away,"" she said.

Chief Kariuki suggests that a lasting solution involves getting alternative sources of income for commercial sex workers.

""If we can change and positively keep the women busy, then we will have succeeded, Sende Moto will be the Kirathimo estate we want. I thank the national government for its commitment to fighting and eradicating alcoholic and drug consumption and trade. That support has helped, and the situation has improved at Sende Moto,"" said the administrator.

"Start-up turns marine plastic waste into eco-desks, chairs","Reasonably priced, durable and flexible, plastic pervades modern life, appearing in almost everything from packaging to clothes to beauty products. But it is thrown away on a massive scale.

According to the United Nations Environmental Agency, the world is inundated with plastic waste. Half of the 400 million plastic tonnes manufactured each year are meant for single use.

Large volumes of plastic remain in the environment for extended periods, posing a threat to both human and planetary health.

The primary cause of these escalating negative effects is the nearly exponential and ongoing rise in plastics usage and manufacturing worldwide.

The problem will probably get worse due to anticipated changes in consumer patterns, urbanisation and population expansion.

Less than 10 per cent of the 172 million plastic tonnes that are consumed in Africa get recycled. Between 19 and 23 million tonnes are thought to end up in lakes, rivers and oceans, having a catastrophic impact on the ecology, economy and society.

Local start-up TwendeGreen Eco-cycle recycles marine plastic waste from informal settlements into high-quality, reasonably priced, and long-lasting school eco-desks and chairs, while also fostering job opportunities and economic growth for the surrounding community.

This helps to address Kenya’s growing marine plastic waste problem while contributing to education development.

The social venture was founded in January 2023 by Churchill Muriuki, Lawrence Kosgei, Zainab Mahmoud and Faraj Ramadhan.

“Mombasa Plastics Prize; an initiative that brought together young innovators from Mombasa to find innovative solutions to tackle marine plastic waste, gave rise to TwendeGreen Eco-cycle. Our team won this competition overall, which confirmed our vision and gave us the first push to make our idea a reality,” says Mr Muriuki.

“For us, receiving this award was not just an accolade; it was a spurt that drove us forward and gave us the self-assurance and means to make a big difference,” he adds.

He says their initial capital was Sh3.5 million which they won from the Mombasa Plastics Prize.

“We used it to purchase some of the essential equipment, leased a workspace and covered initial operational costs. This financial support allowed us to establish a solid foundation, from which we could start collecting, processing and recycling plastic waste into school furniture,” he says.

Mr Muriuki outlines the challenges faced by schools nationwide due to the high prices of wooden school furniture.

Their solution, which is now being introduced in schools in Mombasa’s informal settlements, leverages recycled plastic waste to manufacture affordable desks, that are both environmentally conscious and uncompromising in quality.

The company buys plastic waste from the local plastic collectors from informal settlements, community-based organisations, and plastic waste collecting companies that transport the plastics to the warehouse.

“The plastic is sorted, cleaned and shredded upon arrival at our facilities to get it ready for transformation. Plastic boards are then produced by compressing the shreds of plastic with a press moulding machine under high pressure and temperature. Our carpenters then cut and assemble these boards to create eco-friendly school furniture, including desks and chairs,” he says.

The main goal of the TwendeGreen Eco-cycle is to simultaneously address the severe issue of marine plastic pollution and the shortage of school furniture.

“As Mombasa natives, we all witnessed the grave challenges of degraded environmental conditions and insufficient educational resources,” says Mr Muriuki, adding that by combining these two urgent problems, they envisioned a solution to address both the environmental degradation and the community’s need for education.

An innate love of the environment drove the founders’ foray into the recycling industry. Their mutual love of sustainability and environmental preservation drew them together and inspired them to explore the potential of recycling.

“Mombasa generates approximately 120 tonnes of plastic waste every day, of which only five percent is recycled. A significant portion of this waste is dumped into the ocean. It takes 13 kilograms of plastic waste, which would otherwise end up in the ocean and pollute the marine ecosystem,” he says.

TwendeGreen Eco-cycle has developed close ties with the Mombasa County Ministry of Education, which has acknowledged and supported the company’s efforts to supply sustainable school furniture.

The company has also received approval and support from several respectable organisations, including USAID and Challenge Works UK.

“We serve primary schools, corporate entities, junior secondary schools, and non-governmental organisations. Our furniture solutions are made to last and are reasonably priced to cater for the different needs of our customers,” he states.

Currently, the company has employed seven people, including experts in a range of fields. Their prices, which range from Sh4,500 to Sh5,500 per desk, he says, are reasonable for their items and that once they start bulk production, the price will go down to affordable rates.

Their goals include becoming Kenya’s premier supplier of sustainable furniture, drastically lowering plastic pollution and supporting environmental conservation, even though he recognises that they have encountered challenges, such as changing people’s attitudes towards recycled goods and obtaining the necessary machinery for effective production.

Regarding entering the cut-throat market, he agrees that a multifaceted strategy is required.

“We leveraged social media to showcase our products to a larger audience. Our dedication to sustainability and quality helped us stand out in the congested industry, and marketing and advertising were key factors in developing our brand presence,” he says.

Looking ahead, TwendeGreen Eco-cycle intends to diversify into various types of office and household furniture, according to Mr Muriuki.

“We are committed to leaving a lasting impact through our work, and we believe in the power of innovation and collaboration to create a better world. In addition to endangering coastal tourism and marine life, marine plastics contribute to climate change. When plastics get into oceans, they break down into micro-plastics which are consumed by marine animals,” he says in conclusion.

The company has accomplished several noteworthy milestones. In addition to receiving the Mombasa Plastics Prize, they were privileged to meet both the US Ambassador to Kenya and King Charles during his royal visit to Kenya.

"Start-up turns marine plastic waste into eco-desks, chairs","Reasonably priced, durable and flexible, plastic pervades modern life, appearing in almost everything from packaging to clothes to beauty products. But it is thrown away on a massive scale.

According to the United Nations Environmental Agency, the world is inundated with plastic waste. Half of the 400 million plastic tonnes manufactured each year are meant for single use.

Large volumes of plastic remain in the environment for extended periods, posing a threat to both human and planetary health.

The primary cause of these escalating negative effects is the nearly exponential and ongoing rise in plastics usage and manufacturing worldwide.

The problem will probably get worse due to anticipated changes in consumer patterns, urbanisation and population expansion.

Less than 10 per cent of the 172 million plastic tonnes that are consumed in Africa get recycled. Between 19 and 23 million tonnes are thought to end up in lakes, rivers and oceans, having a catastrophic impact on the ecology, economy and society.

Local start-up TwendeGreen Eco-cycle recycles marine plastic waste from informal settlements into high-quality, reasonably priced, and long-lasting school eco-desks and chairs, while also fostering job opportunities and economic growth for the surrounding community.

This helps to address Kenya’s growing marine plastic waste problem while contributing to education development.

The social venture was founded in January 2023 by Churchill Muriuki, Lawrence Kosgei, Zainab Mahmoud and Faraj Ramadhan.

“Mombasa Plastics Prize; an initiative that brought together young innovators from Mombasa to find innovative solutions to tackle marine plastic waste, gave rise to TwendeGreen Eco-cycle. Our team won this competition overall, which confirmed our vision and gave us the first push to make our idea a reality,” says Mr Muriuki.

“For us, receiving this award was not just an accolade; it was a spurt that drove us forward and gave us the self-assurance and means to make a big difference,” he adds.

He says their initial capital was Sh3.5 million which they won from the Mombasa Plastics Prize.

“We used it to purchase some of the essential equipment, leased a workspace and covered initial operational costs. This financial support allowed us to establish a solid foundation, from which we could start collecting, processing and recycling plastic waste into school furniture,” he says.

Mr Muriuki outlines the challenges faced by schools nationwide due to the high prices of wooden school furniture.

Their solution, which is now being introduced in schools in Mombasa’s informal settlements, leverages recycled plastic waste to manufacture affordable desks, that are both environmentally conscious and uncompromising in quality.

Sakaja suffers blow as his supplementary budget is slashed,"Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has been dealt a heavy blow after the office of the Controller of Budget (COB) cut down his Supplementary Budget for the ending financial year 2023/2024.

The Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang'o said some of the project funding have been reduced and some completely scrapped in the 2023/24 FY for failure to adhere to the Public Finance Management Act (PFM), 2012.

The Act provides specific guidelines on how budget variations should be conducted legally.

Section 135 of the Act states that the supplementary budget is required when there is a need to reallocate funds to different areas than those originally planned.

In its submission, the county had amended the recurrent budget expenditure for the County Public Service Board from the current Sh127 million to Sh130 million, which is an increase of Sh3.5 million.

However, upon examination, Ms Nyakang'o slashed the development budget under the Public Service Board by Sh10 million.

In the Public Service Management sector, the COB has reduced the Development Budget from Sh20 million to Sh10 million.

The development budget in the Agriculture sector has also been slashed from Sh96.3 million to Sh27.7 million.

The development budget that had been allocated to the County Assembly has equally been reduced by Sh915 million, leaving only Sh300 million in the budget for development out of the current total budget allocation of Sh2.4 billion to the County Assembly.

In Nairobi Revenue Authority sector, which the governor has been relying to collect Sh20 billion target in the ending year, COB has scrapped off the development funding of Sh100 million which had been allocated by the governor.

Additionally, COB has further revised down the development budget in the Inclusivity Public Participation and Citizen Engagement sector.

The original development budget in the Inclusivity sector was Sh560 million, which the country through Supplementary Budget had slashed Sh175 million.

However, that did not stop COB from reducing it by Sh476 million, only leaving the sector with a budget of Sh1.8 billion.

The Innovation and Digital Economy department has also been affected as COB reduced the development expenditure from Sh9.7 million.

The budget for the Ward Development Fund has equally been reduced by Sh655 million, leaving the sector with Sh1.3 billion, and not Sh1.96 billion as captured in the ending year.

The development budget in the Boroughs and Public Administration sector has been slashed from Sh1.19 billion to Sh748 million.

Health department has not been spared by COB, downgrading Sakaja’s development budget from Sh1.13 billion to Sh519 million.

The Mobility and Works sector has also been reduced from Sh3.3 billion to Sh1.7 billion.

Ms Nyakang'o COB stated that the reallocation of funds in the supplementary budget exceeded the ten percent limit of the total expenditure approved for some programs or sub-votes, which contravenes Section 154(2) (c) of the PFM Act.

Additionally, the COB said that some of the approvals were made without necessary approvals from the County Treasury, and in some cases, the County Assembly was not properly informed or did not approve the changes.

Governor Sakaja has also been spotted for requesting for relocation in some sectors without detailed explanations or justifications, which is a requirement under Section 154(2) (b) of the PFM Act.

Defending the Supplementary Budgets after being flagged, the County Executive Committee Member for Finance and Planning Mr Charles Kerich stated that budget estimates for the FY 2023/24 were submitted to among others make the budget alive to the realities of revenue inflows, and budget absorption among other factors.

Mr Kerich said the development budgets for County Public Service Board and Nairobi Revenue Authority were scrapped and that the allocations have been carried forward to the next financial year with the purchase of revenue mobilisation vehicles.

“The budget for the County Assembly was reduced as a result of an agreement with the County Government to provide land for construction of the administration block. The cost of acquisition of land and other attendant costs were hence knocked off the budget,” Mr Kerich said.

"Israeli attack on Rafah tent camp kills 45, prompts international outcry","CAIRO/JERUSALEM, May 27 - An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.

Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties.

""In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,"" he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers.

Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.

""We were praying... and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,"" said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf.

""All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.""

Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames.

More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.

Medics later said an Israeli airstrike on Monday on a house in Rafah had killed seven Palestinians, with several others wounded.

Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on ""precise intelligence"", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.

That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip.

Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

The U.S. urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion.

""Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said. ""But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.""

French President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""outraged"" over Israel's latest attacks. ""These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,"" he said on X. Several thousand demonstrators later gathered in Paris to protest against the offensive in Gaza.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected.

""International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,"" Baerbock said.

Canada's government said it was ""horrified"" by the deadly airstrike in Rafah, and called for an immediate ceasefire.

""Canada does not support an Israeli military operation in Rafah,"" Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a post on X. ""This level of human suffering must come to an end.""

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange.

NO SAFE ZONE

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings.

Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds.

Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze.

""The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,"" he said.

The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned ""the heinous massacre."" Egypt also condemned Israel's ""deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people"", state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law.

On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.

Egypt's military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating.

Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said.

In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

Damaris Okumu: My baby’s well-being made me quit nursing to start flourishing daycare,"Long working hours often left Damaris Okumu, a nurse, worried about her newborn son’s welfare. Barely six months after resuming work from maternity leave, the now mother of three had been treated to lots of inconveniences by her housekeepers.

So bad was the situation for Ms Okumu, a first-time mother then, who had to abandon her profession in 2015 to be a stay-at-home mother.

“I had spoken to my husband about the challenges and after some time, I decided to sacrifice my job for the safety of my son,” she says.

Her decision, she says, had been inspired by the injuries her son was nursing almost every week. The months-old boy also had rushes around his genitals which kept increasing, the doctors had advised that they could have resulted from the toddler overstaying in diapers.

Leaving the workplace earlier to take care of the young boy was also close to impossible since sometimes the duties would stretch to late at night.

Challenges

But this was not the first time she had witnessed similar challenges with a house help.

“I worked in the children’s section at a health facility before going into early retirement. During the few years I was employed, women would check into the facility with children who had sustained injuries or were unwell due to poor supervision by their caregivers,” says Ms Okumu.

While at home, she enrolled for a master’s degree course in public health and graduated in the year 2020.

During her free time, she was always researching on how to establish a daycare. Upon graduation, together with her husband, they decided to start up a baby care unit. A place where career mothers would drop their children without fears of the babies being mistreated; a home away from home.

After renting a space at the Kisumu Milimani Estate, she settled on constructing and equipping the facility.

The daycare founder says she had used Sh6 million family savings, to cater for new constructions, play parks, security camera installation, stationeries, landscaping, school van, renovation and license.

“The thought of having a daycare first crossed my mind before I left my job, I wanted to bring up my children the way I deemed right, check on them whenever I wanted to and without any fears,” says Ms Okumu.

Ms Okumu says she was also looking forward to fusing her nursing and public health skills to run the facility. The daycare's operations- Inventist School- kicked off in late 2021 with only six children; two were Ms Okumu’s sons.

She says she had employed a manager who also came in with her two children.

“The rest of the children belonged to two parents who had kept in touch after seeing us kick off the daycare construction and had promised to stay in touch,” says Ms Okumu.

When Powering SMEs visited Investist School, Ms Okumu was busy admitting new children.

She says that within the past two years, the school’s population has grown to 57. She has also expanded her services from the daycare to Grade Four.

“More children kept coming to our facility through referrals, by the end of the year, we had admitted quite a number,” she says, adding that the admission age is from one year.

She says they avoid admitting children below the age of one so as not to interfere with their breastfeeding programme.

Primary school

When the toddlers outgrew the daycare and were ready for primary school, their parents requested that the school could as well offer learning services.

Ms Okumu says she saw this as an opportunity and started with PP1 and PP2, years later, the parents had requested that she upgrade and before she knew it, they were in Grade Four.

“Hopefully, by next year, we will be at Grade Six. While I had only hoped to put up a daycare, look at how far we have moved,” says Ms Okumu.

Read: Drive to upgrade daycare facilities in city launched

The school founder says she charges Sh43,000 per term for the daycare services due to the range of services offered to the toddlers.

At the daycare, the one-year-olds are taught basic and academic skills to use washrooms while observing hygiene. The caregivers also have a role in helping the toddlers with their speech development.

“We train them how to express themselves, the basic words like salutation and sorry to help with socialising,” Ms Okumu says.

They are also taught how to hold objects including pens. The daycare also ensures the learners are well-fed with a balanced diet to help their growth and development.

The institution has developed a routine of mentoring young individuals, bathing, feeding and allowing them to sleep daily before their pick-up time. The learners in pre-school pay a fee of Sh42,000 while Grades one to four pay Sh43,000 per term exclusive of a uniform fee.

Safety of learners

“The daycare services kick off as early as 6am and may close as late as 8 pm depending on requests from parents,” says Ms Okumu.

She further explains that for the safety of the learners, they have employed trained teachers to take the children through the sessions. The facility has also mounted CCTV cameras in various rooms to monitor how the teachers and caregivers take care of the toddlers.

Ms Okumu however says that she is considering running the daycare during school holidays this year due to requests she has been receiving from parents.

Currently, all her three children are at the institution with the last born who just moved to Grade One last year.

Back at home, Ms Okumu says she still has a house help, but her duties are now only restricted to housework.

She says one of the challenges is having a few toddlers at the daycare during school holidays.

“My motivation has however been staying on despite challenges and acknowledging that I was starting something that should outgrow our lifetime and aspiration,” she says

She concludes: “I believe I have helped to solve the problem faced by most career mothers including myself.”

Okutoyi battles for last shot at Paris Olympics,"African Games women’s singles tennis champion, Angella Okutoyi, starts her last lap of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games on Tuesday with two tournaments lined up on the hard courts of Tennis Club A.S. Marsa in La Marsa, Tunisia.

Okutoyi, who is up six places to 496 in the latest WTA singles rankings, is in the main draw in the W35 La Marsa tournament and will face Georgian fourth-seeded Mariam Bolkvadze (329) in the first round.

The Kenyan needs to get into the top 400 by June 10 to qualify for her first Summer Games set for July 26 to August 11 in the French capital.

The Auburn University second-year student currently has 109 points. To get into the Olympic qualification bracket, Okutoyi must get not less than 50 points from this week’s  W35 La Marsa tournament, and the W50 La Marsa tournament from June 3-9.

ITF requirements

“I don’t have much to say at the moment, but I’d like Kenyans to put me in prayers as I head to these two tournaments,” Okutoyi, 20, told Nation Sport yesterday.

In a women's pro tennis tournament of W35 level with 16 players in the main draw, one gets four points for reaching Round 16, eight in the quarter-final, 14 in the semi-final, 23 in the final, and 35 for clinching the title.

The W50 tournament with 32 players in the main draw sees one collecting one point in the Round of 32, six in the Round of 16, 11 in the quarter-final, 20 in the semi-final, 33 in the final, and 50 for winning the crown.

This means Okutoyi has her work cut out as she must make it to the final of the two events to meet the International Tennis Federation (ITF) requirements for players ranked outside the Top 400, who are also champions in their continents.

Anything less than a final could end her hopes of becoming the first-ever Kenyan to compete in tennis at the Olympics.

First-round bye

She placed herself in the race for the Paris 2024 Olympics by winning the African Games in March in Accra, Ghana.

Enroute to the title, she got a first-round bye and then saw off Zambian Naomi Chileshe 6-3, 6-1 (Round of 32), Egyptian Merna Refaat 6-3, 6-3 (Round of 16), Moroccan Aya El Aouni 6-4, 6-4 (quarter-final), Egyptian Mayar Sherif 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (semi-final) and Lamis Alhussein from Egypt 6-4, 6-2 (final).

Beating Sherif, who was ranked 70th globally at the time, was Okutoyi’s first-ever victory over a player ranked in the Top 100.

Sheriff, who won bronze at the African Games, is currently ranked 72nd after dropping 19 places in the latest rankings after losing 2-0 to American Peyton Stearns in the Morocco Open final in Rabat on May 25.

The top 56 players in the world qualify directly for the Olympics.

Teen gang sucks life out of vibrant Tana River town,"It is no longer safe to be out and about after dusk in Madogo town.

A marauding gang of teenage criminals christened the “Kayole Brothers”, has taken over the bustling urban settlement that used to be the pride of Tana River County as the only town that operated 24 hours a day in the region.

But now, when darkness falls, terrorised residents shut themselves in their houses hoping for the best but resigned to their fate.

By 6pm, businesses begin to close and by half past 7pm, the town yields to the darkness, opening the door for the teenage gangsters to reign.

A power blackout that has persisted for the past 30 days has made matters worse.

“I have had to retrench workers from my pub business because we can’t operate at night and running a generator has proved to be too expensive,” Mr Japheth Mutua, who operates a bar in the town, told the Nation on Monday.

Gang protection fees

For those willing to risk it and run their businesses till daybreak, they must pay the gang protection fees.

The criminals charge Sh1,000 per night for bar owners and Sh500 for shopkeepers and hoteliers. The protection fee is, however, valid only while within the premises and the client's safety while outside is not a guarantee.

Residents leaving work at night have also mastered the art of negotiating with the delinquents for their security.

“I part with Sh100 every day to be escorted home. Once I leave work, I must tag along with one of them or else I become a target,” said Ms Anne Silwa, a shop attendant.

Tana River County Police Commander Ali Ndiema told the Nation that patrols have been intensified.

He notes that whereas the teen gang dubbed the “Kayole Brothers” is a menace, security officers have reduced their activities and influence around the town.

“We are doing our best and appeal to residents to support us by reporting cases of crime and helping us to catch these characters instead of tolerating them,"" he said.

Further, he warned that parents of suspected gang members will equally be held responsible for crimes committed by their children if they are arrested.

“Every parent should know where their children are. If we get bad reports or we happen to arrest any child involved in criminal activities, the parent will also be charged for conspiracy,"" he said.

Madogo is in darkness because the electricity poles for the main power line fell as a result of the flooding along the Madogo-Garissa highway.

The lack of power has inconvenienced residents. The few people who are able to own solar panels are charging phones for people at a fee of Sh50.

Clean water has also become scarce because electric water motors cannot be used as a result of the blackout. Locals are forced to buy water from vendors or fetch from River Tana amid a cholera crisis in the county.

""We are suffering, businesses are making big losses and others cannot operate. People are losing jobs. This is killing our economy,"" said Hashim Bamaru, a resident.

Schools are not able to have evening preps, and management of the learning institutions are spending a lot of money to buy water.

Residents say that their appeal to Kenya Power Company to restore electricity has fallen on deaf ears.

Restoring power line

""Nobody is explaining to us the difficulty in restoring the power line. We are not seeing any explanation online nor have heard anything on the radio. They just decided to ignore us,"" said Mohamed Abdikadir, a resident.

Human rights activists have announced a week-long protest if the situation is not resolved at the end of a seven-day ultimatum.

“These people have a right to Kenya Power services and they have a right to proper explanation. If Kenya Power is having a problem we should be told so that we can know the way forward,” said James Rashid, secretary-general Civil Society Organisations Network.

Kenya Power County Manager Silas Limo said flood waters from River Tana knocked down electricity poles.

""We are keen to restore power in Madogo, but the area is still flooded, so it may take time to fix the poles. I appeal for patience,” Mr Limo said.

Mitigate climate change by using green energy,"By Ann Amollo

Green energy comes from natural sources that are clean and renewable, contributing to a sustainable environment.

Advances in technology have enabled organisations to innovate and develop energy sources with lower carbon emissions, resulting in reduced environmental pollution. This leads to fewer cases of diseases that affect both children and adults.

These natural energy sources are highly beneficial as they are cost-effective. For example, solar energy harnesses power from the sun and wind energy uses the wind, both of which are abundant and free.

Renewable energy sources are emerging, significantly impacting our environment and helping to mitigate climate change.

Advocating green energy use is essential to raise public awareness of climate change. By promoting these energy sources, we can achieve long-term environmental sustainability and positive climate change.

Green energy has many benefits to society. Through awareness campaigns, communities have adopted these renewable, clean energy sources, creating a conducive environment for sustainable living.

Let us be custodians of nature by promoting clean energy for long-term environmental sustainability and climate improvement.

Ann Amollo, Migori

Record-breaking Beatrice Chebet sets target for Olympic Games,"Freshly-minted world 10,000 metres record holder, Beatrice Chebet, has set herself an ambitious target of competing in both the 25-lap race, and women’s 5,000m at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

On Saturday night, the 24-year-old world cross country and world 5,000m champion broke the world record in women’s 10,000m by seven seconds at the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, in USA.

She became the first woman to run the race in under 29 minutes when she shattered Ethiopian runner Letesenbet Gidey’s world record of 29 minutes, 01.03sec from June 8, 2021 in Hengelo, the Netherlands with a blistering new time of 28:54.14.

This is the second world record that Chebet, who is also the Commonwealth Games 5,000m champion, is breaking inside a year.

Chebet brought down the 5km world record (women-only) on the road after clocking 14:13 at the Cursa dels Nassos road race in Barcelona, Spain on December 31, 2023.

“I am going to double in the two races in Paris but my target is to run the 5,000m first, then the 10,000m ,” Chebet told Nation Sport on Saturday. It was her first victory over 10,000m in a race held outside the country and her second ever over the distance.

“I’m particularly happy to run a world record here at the Prefontaine Classic,” explained Chebet, who produced the best last kilometre of two minutes and 47 seconds on her way to rewriting women’s 10,000m history books on track.

Even though Athletics Kenya was using the race to pick its team for the Paris Olympic Games, the focus was on Ethiopia’s world 10,00m champion Gudaf Tsegay, who had called for a world record pace at the race.

Things turned bad for Tsegay, the 5,000m world record holder as Chebet, the world 5,000m bronze medallist turned on the screws.

“The last lap just motivated me, especially when Gudaf dropped off. I then realised I had a good chance of winning and I took it,” said Chebet. She took up the challenge to go toe-to-toe with Gudaf, who had requested a world record pace.

“I decided to keep pace with her so as to see how I would respond. My body responded well then I decided to go to the end,” Chebet, who thanked her management Rosa Associate, her coach Gabriel Kiptanui and everyone at home for their great support, said.

Chebet also shattered the national record of 29:32.53 held by Vivian Cheruiyot from the 2016 Rio Olympics Games.

Tsegay and Chebet treated fans to thrilling moments as they battled at the front to stay ahead of the green wave light that indicated the world record pace by two metres. Chebet dropped Tsegay with 1,000m to go to win.

Seasoned road runner Daniel Mateiko won men's 10,000metres race ahead of world 5km bronze medallist Nicholas Kimeli to second place.

Mateiko won in a world lead and personal best time of 26:50.81 as Kimeli also set personal best 26:50.94 to all claim the Paris Olympic tickets.

Bernard Kibet came third also in personal best 26:51.09 in a race where six athletes ran under the Olympics standards of 27 minutes.

However, world 10,000m silver medallist Daniel Simiu came a distant eighth in 27:24.33 and can only bank on selectors for a node in the team for Paris Olympics.

Kenya is yet to win the men’s 10,000m title at the Olympics since the late Naftali Temu’s exploits at the 1968 Mexico City Games.

The country has yet to win in women’s 10,000m since the race debuted at the Summer Games in 1988 Seoul. Sally Kipyego (2012 London) and Vivian Cheruiyot (2016 Rio) claimed silver medals as the best performers.

Other Kenyans - world 800m champion Mary Moraa and Beatrice Chepkoech - finished second in their respective 800m and 3,000m steeplechase races.

Moraa clocked season's best 1:56.71 but lost to Olympic Games silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson, who set a world lead of 1:55.78.

Chepkoech, the winner in Xiamen and Shanghai, timed 8:56.51 to lose to Olympic champion Peruth Chemutai from Uganda in a world lead and national record of 8:55.09.

BAT offers farmers Sh200 per kilo to stem mass exit,"BAT Kenya has raised tobacco leaf prices to nearly Sh200 a kilo in a bid to rein in a sustained drop in the number of contracted farmers.

Latest disclosures show the cigarette maker raised the pay per kilo by five percent to Sh198.75 in the financial year ended December 2023 (compared to Sh189.2 the prior year) even as grower numbers fell below 2,000 for the first time in years.

The fall in the number of contracted producers, mainly in western Kenya and who numbered over 5,700 a decade earlier, has coincided with a fall in the amount of tobacco being supplied to BAT, putting the company under pressure.

The firm has been responding to this decline through different initiatives such as offering free tobacco seedlings, fertiliser and personal protective equipment as well as encouraging crop diversification by issuing farmers free or subsidised maize and avocado seeds to plant and earn an extra income without abandoning tobacco.

1,672 farmers

BAT closed last year with 1,672 farmers, a 19.7 percent drop from 2,083 in the previous year, meaning that it has lost about 67 percent of the 5,000 farmers it had five years earlier.

Many tobacco farmers, mainly drawn from Bungoma, Busia, Migori and Homabay, have been transitioning to alternative high yielding crops like beans and maize with help from anti-tobacco lobbies.

BAT’s Sh198.75 per kilo paid to farmers last year amounted to Sh954 million, marking the second straight year that the payout is below Sh1 billion. Total pay in 2022 was Sh946 million.

The amount of tobacco leaf delivered to BAT has declined for the fourth straight year, coming from 8.9 million kilos in 2019 to 4.8 million last year to mark the first time in about a decade that the number has dropped below five million kilos.

Hybrid tobacco seed varieties

BAT has been increasing the prices per leaf, hitting Sh198.75 last year, having crossed the Sh170 mark in 2022. The price per kilogramme was Sh118.70 in 2017.

It has also introduced ‘Thrive’, a global initiative that was rolled out by its parent company, BAT Group, in 2016 to make tobacco farming attractive.

BAT Kenya used the programme to introduce hybrid tobacco seed varieties to enhance crop yield and disease resistance. The firm has also introduced low-cost technology, including the use of mechanised ploughing and ridgers, as part of efforts to cut costs and maximise returns for farmers.

"Police, Leopards semis clash called off due to crowd trouble","The second semi-final of the Mozzart Bet Cup between Kenya Police and AFC Leopards at Police Sacco Stadium was on Sunday aborted in the second half due to crowd trouble.

Police were leading 1-0 courtesy of Tito Okello’s seventh-minute header when centre referee Brookes Onyango brought the match to a halt in the 62nd minute after assistant referee Simon Kuria was hit by a projectile by a suspected Leopards fan.

Things were made worse after a section of fans breached the barrier between them and the pitch.

Leopards chairman Dan Shikanda criticised the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) for allowing the match to be held at the Police’s turf, saying it can’t host a high-risk match.

Shikanda said FKF turned down their request to have the match played at Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Kisumu was turned down by the federation and vowed not to have the match replayed at the same venue.

“It will be very unfair (if FKF awards Police a win in the match) because we were on top of our opponent since the second half started,” said an angry Shikanda. “We want the match replayed in a proper stadium with the proper organisation for us to get a proper team to play in the continental.”

Part of the FKF rules states that “if a match cannot start or cannot be played in full, or remaining match time shall be played and/or concluded on the next day, without prejudice to any possible disciplinary measures.”

Shall fix a new date

“In case a match is abandoned, and the Organising Committee decides a continuation of play, the match shall recommence with the same score at the minute at which play was interrupted. For the avoidance of doubt, the Organising Committee may decide a full replay of the match that was abandoned. If the match cannot be rescheduled the next day, the Organising Committee shall fix a new date.”

By the time of going to press, FKF had not issued a decision on the match. But sources at the federation told Nation Sport that the match is likely to resume behind closed doors at the same venue today at 10am.

Earlier at the same venue, KCB progressed to the final after defeating 2018 champions Kariobangi Sharks 4-2 in post-match penalties after they battled to a 1-1 draw in normal time.

Apart from pocketing Sh2 million, the winner of the Mozzart Bet Cup also represents the country in next season's Caf Confederation Cup. Both Police and KCB are eying their maiden appearance in the continental club football tournament.

Saved two penalties

Goalkeeper Faruk Shikalo was the hero for KCB after he saved two penalties.

Striker Derrick Otanga had put KCB ahead in the 76th minute, but Fortune Omoto equalised for Sharks two minutes later.

With the two sides still tied 1-1 at the end of an additional 30 minutes, the match was decided in penalties.

Otanga, Henry Onyango, Danson Chetambe, and Brian Ochieng were on target for KCB, while Sharks’ two goals were scored by Kevinluke Otiala and Fredrick Alushula.

Stanley Wilson and Geoffrey Onyango were denied by goalkeeper Shikalo. KCB’s coach Bernard Mwalala is hoping to lift the Mozzart Bet Cup for the second time after guiding Bandari to victory in 2019 where they defeated Sharks 3-1 in the final.

“We played very well but there are areas we must improve on ahead of the finals. It feels really good to again be in the finals,” said Mwalala.

Holders Kakamega Homeboyz were bundled out by KCB by a solitary goal in the quarterfinals.

Trump booed and heckled by raucous crowd at Libertarian convention,"Washington,

Presidential candidate Donald Trump was booed and heckled by many in a raucous audience at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night, a marked change from the adulation he receives at rallies from his fervently loyal supporters.

Libertarians, who believe in limited government and individual freedom, blame Trump, a Republican, for rushing through the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and for not doing more to stop public health restrictions on the unvaccinated during the pandemic.

When Trump took to the stage in Washington, there were loud boos and jeers. A smaller section of the crowd, Trump supporters, cheered him.

Shortly before he appeared, one Libertarian Party member shouted: ""Donald Trump should have taken a bullet!""

Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hostile reception.

Trump, who was president between 2017 and 2021, immediately mentioned the total 88 felony charges he faces in four federal and state prosecutions.

""If I wasn't a libertarian I am now,"" he said. He denounced the administration of President Joe Biden, his challenger in the November 5 election rematch, and Biden's fellow Democrats as being part of a ""rise in left-wing fascism"".

Trump was trying to appeal to libertarians, who have more in common with Republican policy positions than Democrats on issues including taxes and the size of government, in what is expected to be a closely fought election.

1.8 million votes

He added: ""We should not be fighting each other."" He asked libertarians to work with him to defeat Biden, an appeal which was greeted by many boos, although the vast majority in the crowd were fiercely opposed to Biden and his administration.

Libertarians garnered only 1.2 percent of the national vote in 2020, or about 1.8 million votes, but November's election could be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states, so Trump is seeking to peel away some libertarian support.

Trump's appearance at the libertarian gathering, unusual for a Republican White House candidate, also signalled how seriously he and his campaign take the threat of third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long opposed vaccines and mandates, and who spoke to the convention on Friday.

Trump has been ramping up attacks on Kennedy, who is running as an independent, recently calling him a ""fake"" anti-vaccination proponent.

Opinion polls suggest Kennedy will siphon votes away from both Trump and Biden, but it is not yet clear which of the major-party candidates will be hurt more by Kennedy's long-shot White House bid.

Libertarian Party

Libertarian Party organisers said Biden was also invited to speak to the convention but he declined to attend.

""The Libertarian Party can make a big difference. If we unite we will be unstoppable,"" Trump said to a mix of applause and jeers.

Trump said he was a ""libertarian without even trying to be one,"" and that the Libertarian Party should endorse him, another line greeted by boos and jeers.

Undeterred, Trump poked fun at the crowd, saying if they did not back him, they would continue to garner just a tiny portion of voter support in national elections.

He pledged to put a libertarian in his cabinet if he wins the election, which was met by cries of ""bullshit!""

Trump did get huge applause for one promise. A rallying cry for libertarians is the case of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a life sentence for creating and operating the website Silk Road, which allowed users to secretly buy and sell drugs and other illegal products.

Libertarians believe Ulbricht's 2015 sentence represents government and judicial overreach. In front of a crowd holding ""Free Ross"" signs, Trump promised to commute Ulbricht's sentence if he wins back the White House.

 ,"Sitting in a makeshift shade on a seat with two cushions and two pillows for comfort, he nodded as he sang along to some gospel hymns playing in the background.

This is where Moses Kiprop Rerimoi, 28, from Kipkoriony Village in Eldama Ravine, has been staying since February 2016 after being discharged from the hospital following a road accident that left him immobile.

Despite his condition, he manages to put a smile on his face as he sits down on the sofa to exchange pleasantries.

Kiprop's father, Symon Cheruiyot, remembers the fateful day as if it were yesterday. It was on August 6, 2015, when family members, relatives and friends had gathered at a hotel in Kabarnet town to fundraise for his elder brother, Dennis Rerimoi, then a student at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), who was to fly to India for a kidney transplant.

Diagnosed with diabetes

Dennis had been diagnosed with diabetes in 2000, and his situation worsened, leading to kidney failure in 2004.

In the afternoon of the same day, Kiprop, who was in Form Four, preparing to sit his national examination the following term, had closed school for a holiday and joined his family members for the funding in town.

Shortly after, Kiprop was sent to pick something in their Kaptimbor home, on the outskirts of the town, close to a kilometre away. He rode a motorcycle to save time.

That is when their world came crumbling down. Some few minutes after leaving, they received reports that their third-born son had lost control of the motorcycle he was riding at Kapkogorwa village and crashed his head on a stone.

“I don’t even want to remember the feeling I had after I received the news of my son’s accident, but all the same, I had to be strong to handle the situation. We were just going on with arrangements to fundraise for his elder brother, who was set to be flown to India for a kidney transplant when I received a call that Kiprop had been involved in an accident, a kilometre away from Kabarnet town,” said Mr Cheruiyot.

“He was a Form Four candidate at that time and he had closed school for the August holiday that particular day. We sent him to go and pick something at home, little did we know that could be a turning point in our lives, adding to the myriad of tribulations we had. I was forced to leave the fundraiser and attend to him in hospital,” added the distraught father.

At the accident scene, the motorcycle was a wreck, and his head was seriously injured after he crushed it into a stone after he lost control.

Specialised treatment

He was rushed to the Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabarnet and later referred to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret for specialised treatment.

Due to his condition, Kiprop needed to be in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), but the bed capacity at MTRH at the time was exhausted.

“I remember we had a challenge in getting admission in the ICU and went for three more facilities in Eldoret without success, eventually, he was finally admitted at the Reale Hospital. He underwent a head surgery the following day and the medics indicated that he had suffered a brain damage that even cracked the inner membrane of the skull,” said Cheruiyot.

After the surgery, he was in the ICU for more than 21 days. He later spent more than six months in the general ward after his family failed to raise the medical bill that had accrued to more than Sh3 million.

“He was discharged on October 6, 2015, but we had drained all the funds we had to pay the medical bills that had accumulated to more than Sh3 million. We were retained until February the following year after the family fundraised for some amount and Kiprop’s grandmother also parted with her title deed,” he explained.

A month after his discharge, Mr Cheruiyot had to organise another funds drive to take his second-born son Dennis for a kidney transplant in India - he travelled with him and his first-born son, who was also the donor.

After undergoing a successful kidney transplant at Indraprastha Apolo, New Delhi Hospital in India, the family got another challenge after Dennis suffered some complications, prompting some more stay and money for treatment at the ICU.

The family had to sell their two remaining cows to finance their upkeep in India as they planned another fundraiser.

Road accident

They were discharged from the facility months later but needed to spend more than Sh20,000 every month on his drugs and another Sh20,000 for his bedridden brother, who was still recuperating from the injuries he sustained in the road accident.

Sadly, Dennis died in February 2021, six years after undergoing a kidney transplant.

“We have exhausted all we had in treating our two sons. So far, we have spent more than Sh10 million in their treatment. Sadly, Dennis died in 2021 due to complications. Kiprop is still bedridden owing to the injuries he sustained in the accident, and he still needs more money to take him for further medication,” said Mr Cheruiyot.

“It has been a challenge because, after the accident, Kiprop is dependent on people in almost everything because he cannot move on his own. The brain damage made him immobile and he also suffered a memory lapse. In recent years, we also realised that his left leg has turned shorter than the other, indicating that there is a problem,” he explained.

According to the father of four, his bedridden son uses three diapers every day and medication at a cost of Sh10,000 every day.

“My mother deposited her title deed in the hospital as a surety to allow him to get discharged in hospital in 2016 because we could not manage to offset the Sh3.3 million. To date, we still have a debt of more than Sh2.1 which we have not settled yet due to the myriad of challenges. We are also appealing to well-wishers to allow us to take him for further medication because his situation has not improved,” he noted.

“We fear that our land will be auctioned if we do not settle the debt as agreed,” added Cheruiyot.

Pauline Cheruiyot, Kiprop’s mother, couldn't contain her emotions.

“We have had a challenge since 2000 after Dennis was diagnosed with diabetes which later led to kidney failure. After spending more than Sh6 million on his treatment and kidney transplant in 2016, he died six years later. Before he was flown to India, his younger brother was involved in an accident that had made him bedridden for years. It is so painful as a mother seeing your children just slip away like that,” said Pauline while fighting back tears.

Suffered complications

“I even remember that when my husband and our two sons went to India, they were detained after Dennis suffered complications after the transplant, forcing him to be put in an ICU thus inflating the bill. Back at home, I was nursing Kiprop after being released from the hospital following the accident. I had to sell our two remaining cows at the time for their upkeep in the foreign land. Since then, life for us has been tough. We just appeal for help to take our bedridden son for further checkup and treatment,” said Pauline.

With a visible scar on his face, a sharp reminder of the motorcycle crash in 2016, Kiprop, who is struggling to communicate owing to the memory lapse, is very hopeful that he will one day stand on his feet.

“I am appealing for help from well-wishers to help me walk again. My feet are very feeble owing to the accident I was involved in but I am very certain with further medication, I would walk again. Every morning after doing some exercises and being assisted by my father to take a bath, I am forced to sit on this seat under the shade as we pass the day with my grandmother,” said Kiprop.

Chief Kadhi Abdulhalim Athman stops man from evicting estranged wife,"Chief Kadhi has issued an order stopping a man from evicting his estranged wife from their matrimonial home or taking anything from it, pending the hearing and conclusion of a case involving a property dispute between the couple.

Chief Kadhi Abdulhalim Athman said the woman, identified as MAM, will suffer irreparable damage if she is evicted from the matrimonial home and her household items are taken away.

""MAM has nowhere else to go and her right to dignity, housing and accommodation will be prejudiced,"" he said.

At the same time, Chief Kadhi has temporarily delegated the management of the property to an estate agent while a dispute between the couple over its ownership is resolved.

The agent will be selected by the couple's lawyers and approved by the High Court before taking charge of the property, which includes rental houses, and collecting rent.

Rental houses

""The rent proceeds will be distributed as follows while this matter is pending: 35 per cent to the woman and 65 per cent to the man,"" said Chief Kadhi Athman.

However, Chief Kadhi ruled that the man, identified as the COR, had contributed significantly to the construction and development of the rental houses.

""He will thus suffer more damages than the MAM if the orders sought are granted as prayed,"" he said.

Since both parties would incur losses in the event of an unfavourable ruling, Sheikh Athman ordered that the rent be collected and distributed according to the contribution ratio until the dispute was resolved.

Last year, the woman went to court to seek injunctions against the man, his family members or representatives to prevent them from entering, building, trespassing or interfering with her matrimonial home, property and property rights.

She complained that the COR had threatened to evict tenants from rental houses and to collect all household items from the matrimonial home.

The man, however, opposed the application and requested that it be dismissed.

Court records show that the parties were married more than 10 years ago under Islamic law.

Matrimonial home

They initially lived together in rented houses owned by the woman's mother, before jointly purchasing a plot of land on her mother's land and building three-bedroom houses. The man worked abroad to earn an income and often visited his wife in Kenya.

Sometime in 2011, they bought an additional plot of land next to their matrimonial home and built rental houses on it.

Following the completion of this project, ownership and management became a point of contention between the couple.

The court noted that there was no dispute that the parties were still legally married under Islamic law, that the matrimonial home was purchased jointly, and that the rental houses were built during the marriage on land originally owned by the woman's relatives.

""However, the court has the right and authority to declare the rights of the parties to the disputed matrimonial property,"" Sheikh Athman said.

The Chief Kadhi, however, noted that the division of matrimonial property begins upon the dissolution of the marriage.

 ,"Nyawe Deyo, 76, who comes from the Dasanach tribe, a small community with slightly over 19,000 people living in Kenya, fashions her clothes from hide, which she also sleeps on. She once tried a mattress, but it made her itch so much, she never used it again...

Before the boom in modern clothing hit Kenya during pre-colonisation, many tribes and communities donned their finest animal skins, infused with plants and woven with other natural fibers.

While much of this attire is replicated every so often during cultural or national celebration days in Kenya, a woman from a small tribe living in Northern Kenya has made it an intentional effort to never wear modern clothing for the past 76 years.

After a journey that lasted just under two days, we arrive at her manyatta, nestled along the jagged and dusty path that makes up the road network in the village of Illeret, which sits just near the Ethiopian border, in Marsabit County.

Nyawe Deyo, 76, tells Nation.africa hat she already knows why we are here before our interview starts. Her smile, which is characterised by a wide gap between her two front teeth, and which is viewed as a sign of beauty, remains as constant as her energy as she greets us and our translator, who we will require because Nyawe only speaks in the vernacular language of the Dasanach tribe.

To ensure we are comfortable during the interview, she goes into her hut and pulls out a large mat made of goat skin. After we sit, she says she is ready to begin.

“Since I was born, I have never worn a t-shirt or trousers like what you people are wearing. My body has never been in contact with any piece of modern clothing. I have always worn the traditional Dasanach tribe clothing which is made of animal skin,” Nyawe says.

Nyawe is wearing an aged slip skirt made out of goatskin that is the colour of cedar brown, and a gingerbread-coloured, off-shoulder dress- top, embellished with tiny colourful beads. Typically, the top half of her body would be uncovered, but when she first sees us, she is rather awkward and uncomfortable and pulls the top part up.

“What I am wearing on top is pure goat skin. Once a goat is slaughtered, I remove all of the meat until only the skin is left. I work on it until it is completely soft. My shoes are also made from cow skin. I then add accessories such as beads and my colourful necklaces so that it brings out the beauty of the piece,” Nyawe explains.

The Dasanach tribe is a small community with slightly over 19,000 people living in Kenya, even though some Dasanach people are also found in southern Ethiopia.

“The colourful necklaces I am wearing are the most modern thing on me, but the black ones are made from the tail of a dead giraffe, which was found some time ago. I do not think there is anything wrong with modern clothing, but I have just never liked it or wanted it on my body,” she says.

A background search on the Dasanach tribe shows photographs of how the traditional Dasanach woman used to dress back in the day, which mirrors exactly what Nyawe wears. The women from this community often wear their hair in short braids with a part in the middle.

“I have never been embarrassed about how I dress because I believe I am beautiful. People are often shocked and like to follow me around to touch my goatskin clothing. Even when white people sometimes come here, they really look at me. But I believe I am always beautiful in what I wear so why would I feel awkward or embarrassed?” she poses.

We offer Nyawe a t-shirt to see if she will be receptive to it.

“Because I do not want to hurt your feelings, I will take your gift, but I will not wear it. Maybe I can give it to one of my children,” Nyawe tells Lifestyle.

When Kenya witnessed its worst drought in 40 years in 2023, Nyawe says it halted life, as many know it in Illeret, in more ways than one.

“Before the long drought killed many cows and goats, I would send money to someone in Marsabit town to bring me cow or goat skin to make my dresses. I also sleep on hides. I once tried a mattress, but it made me itch so badly that I never used it again,” she says.

Dressing in the Dasanach way is something that Nyawe’s late mother taught her, which is among the reasons she holds on to her way of life so dearly.

“Young traditional Dasanach girls wear something similar to mine, but their attire is called “zahn,” while the one I am wearing, which is for older women is called “nyonkolos.” Amongst my peers, it is only me who has never dressed in any modern clothing. The rest converted,” Nyawe tells us.

The 76-year-old believes that her diet has played a major role in enabling her reach her 70s.

“I only eat traditional foods. I do not eat foods that have chemicals, even though they are as tasty as people say they may be. I mostly eat porridge, milk and beans, and I do not put salt in my food. I cook the food using only the fat extracted from the milk of a cow,” Nyawe says.

Does Nyawe believe that the culture of the Dasanach people is fading?

“Yes, because previously the Dasanach tribe was living the way I am living, but because of changes over time, they have stopped wearing animal skin attire. Many of them now wear clothes and even plastic shoes, which I will never wear,” she vows.

Due to her short frame, Nyawe is not easily the first person you would spot on entering the homestead that is filled with several huts, but she is the most authoritative, as the members of the community, both young and old, male or female, listen to her instructions keenly and keep their distance whenever she moves around, and will only approach her when she calls out to them.

True to her word, she hands the t-shirt that we brought her to one of the small children around her, who is only wearing a pair of orange trousers. The young boy excitedly runs off with it.

She watches him keenly.

“You see, even the young ones do not want to wear our animal skins,” she remarks before walking away

 ,"It is 8am on a Friday in Masol area, West Pokot. A bare-chested man, with a kikoi wrapped around his waist stands atop dung that has just been scooped from a goat's stomach. The man's hair, legs, hands, and chest are smeared with the goat dung.

He is Tulel Ng'uriangole, a 35-yearold. An elderly man holds Tulel's hand and turns him around for another man to smear a new, thicker layer of goat dung on his head. They complete the ritual.

Tulel puts on his sandals and carries his spear, the one he had used to kill the goat, and leaves the men to lap up the raw blood, directly from the belly of the goat. Welcome to Sapana, a ceremony held among the Pokot to usher a man into manhood. Without this dung-smearing and killing an animal with a spear, a man is not considered man enough to marry.

The smearing with dung, fresh from a goat’s stomach by a respected elder, is a sign of wiping childhood into adulthood. When this dung session is done, Tulel holds the spear to prove that ""he can do it"" as ululations rent the air. There are tens of women and men here to feast and perform the ritual.

The men are wearing tiny shorts tucked inside kikois, the women in lokwa skirts and lots of beaded jewellery. The women are allowed to participate in the ceremony because they bring milk.

They jump up as they sing a Pokot chorus of folk songs. Other men are gathered at a bonfire in a semi-circle, and women on the other side are drinking fermented local wine. “I have never seen a huge crowd like this. I'm now a full man.

Now I will offer honey and organise another ceremony for thanksgiving to give out the honey,” Tulel says. The West portends evil According to Pokot tradition, a bull (not one whose tail has been cut, or without horns or a hollow eye) must lie facing the East for blessings, because the West brings about evil.

Tulel pierces the goat on its right side until it dies before it is burned over a fire, whole, without cutting it into pieces, a requirement in this ritual.

A special group of village men take over and open up the slaughtered animal, taking turns to lap up the clots of blood. Some of the blood is kept in a container to be mixed later with milk, a traditional delicacy to be shared. After all this is done, the goat is skinned and cut into pieces. The elders inspect it thoroughly while explaining the contours of the goat’s intestines to predict calamities, ranging from death to strange diseases, and forecast the weather pattern. From the intestines analysed today, it was established that the village would experience rain and everyone should go to the farm to cultivate.

The men then take their place in a semi-circle (Kriket) and wait for the animal to be cooked and served to them. Once the ‘sapana’ is over, a ""special kind of soil"" is applied on Tulel's head and he is adorned with brown ostrich feathers as the women dance in celebration. For decades, the Pokot community that lives in Northern Kenya has been known for its retrogressive cultural practices of cattle rustling and female genital mutilation (FGM), which are gradually dying off.

But there are positive ones, like the modern “Sapana” ritual, which centres on the initiation of boys into adulthood, and the gateway to manhood, which the elders hope will stay on.

Years ago, sapana was done to prepare men for war, but now it is a rite of passage for a man. 12 years Starting at around 12 years of age, young Pokot men would traditionally undergo the Sapana ritual.

The day before an initiation ceremony, the initiate climbs on the back of a cow near his home. On D-Day, the man who kills the bull, goat, or ram goes into the kraal, brandishing his spear. He pierces the bull on its right side.

Usually, a single thrust of the spear should kill the bull. It is directed at the heart. If the animal falls and fails to die, it must be pierced again, but that means the initiate is a sinner. William Lopetakou, a Pokot culture elder, says the Sapana ritual allows young men to sit at the table with the elders and take part in their community’s decision-making. Mr Lopetakou says the ritual originated from the Ateker Karamojong people in Uganda. “The Pokots have embraced it for many decades now.

The ceremony is somewhat religious to chase away evil spirits. It also brings togetherness. For instance, a wooden trough of milk is shared amongst all the people to remove bad omens,"" he says, ""and it reminds the Pokots of the respect they have for cows.

Read: Why 100-year-old Pokot fig tree remains untouched two years after it fell

After God comes a man, a cow, and then a woman."" He adds that the initiator is washed with milk to get rid of curses.

“This indicates that you are free from dirty things like sexually transmitted diseases,” Mr Lopetakou says. The ceremony also seals marriages. ""A married Pokot woman wears a traditional ring on her hand, through the Sapana rite.

If you try seducing such a woman, you are fined,” he says. With modernisation, he says, educated people have shunned the ceremony. “But an undergraduate degree or Master's degree alone doesn't make you a man.

Even if you have these, how will you interact with elders? The rite of passage will see you eat and drink with others, they no longer see you like a child,” he says. Julius Loparar, an elder from Nyangaita Village, says the ritual improves men's marriage prospects. ""Only after a Sapana are you able to negotiate dowry with the elders,"" he says.

Benson Lemnyang, the West Pokot Director of Culture and Heritage, says the ritual improves one’s chances for marriage, once the man and his family have accumulated a dowry of cattle,” he says.

John Muok, who is currently the Pokot Council of Elders Chairperson, and is 80 years old, underwent the rite when he was 25. He says he performed the ritual after marrying two wives. “I slaughtered a big bull. It was a great ceremony, and my parents were very happy to see how blessed I was,” he says.

Heroine Evelyn Prech, who is the Executive Director at the Center of Indigenous Child Rights, (CIC), says the county should start marketing the ceremony as a tourist attraction.

""There is a need to show positive cultures like Adong’o and Sapana, good farming, and honey displays,"" she says.

Okutoyi wins doubles title in Tunisia tourney,"Africa Games champion, Angella Okutoyi of Kenya, playing alongside Egypt’s Merna Refaat, has won the doubles title in W15 Monastir tournament in Tunisia.

Okutoyi and Refaat defeated the Chinese duo of Yi Liu/Jiayu Xu 6-2, 6-2 on the hard courts of Hotel Skanes Family Monastir in Tunisia yesterday.

Fourth-seeded Okutoyi and Refaat went into the final having caused a major upset by seeing off top seeds Zeel Desai (India)/Daria Khomutsianskaya (Belarus) 6-3, 6-1 in the semi-finals in 58 minutes on Friday evening.

The Chinese pair defeated Alyssa Reguer (France)/Arlinda Rushiti (Kosovo) 6-1, 6-3, in the other last four match.

The W15 is the lowest tier of women’s pro tennis.

Okutoyi from Auburn University in the USA is warming up for make-or-break tournaments in the Tunisian city of La Marsa beginning next week as she seeks to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

In the final, Okutoyi and Refaat dominated in serves and won four of six break points compared to Liu/Xu, who did not win at break point five times. Okutoyi/Refaat won all eight games when serving and were also good in receiver points.

It is Okutoyi’s second W15 Monastir doubles win after clinching her first with French partner Beverley Nyangom on July 16, 2023.

En route to her second doubles win in Monastir, Okutoyi/Refaat swept aside Jiaying He/Ying Xhang (China) 6-2, 2-6, 10-7 in the first round and then earned a walkover in the quarter-final against Onyu Choi (South Korea)/Bianca Compuesto (Australia) before tossing out Desai/ Khomutsianskaya in semi-finals.

Okutoyi, who will be leading Kenya's Billie Jean King Cup Africa Group III at the Nairobi Club from June 10-16, did not compete in singles in Monastir where fellow Kenyan Cynthia Cheruto got knocked out 6-2, 6-1 by Daria Kudashova from Russia in the first round.

W15 doubles winners get 15 world ranking points and losing finalists 10, as well as prize money of Sh127,015 and Sh68,495, respectively.

Okutoyi, who became the first Kenyan woman to win a women's pro tournament singles title during the W15 Monastir tournament on July 30, 2023, which was also her first professional title, now shifts focus to W35 La Marsa slated for May 27 to June 2 and W50 La Marsa scheduled for June 3-9 where she will be competing in singles while hoping to collect crucial points to get into the top-400 to qualify for the Paris Olympics.

She is currently ranked 502 globally with 109 points in singles, meaning she needs 50 points from the two tournaments to get into top-400 before June 10 deadline.

 ,"Mfangano is a tiny island covering some 65 kilometres square in the heart of Lake Victoria in Suba North Constituency of Homa Bay County.

On a “Mashemeji derby” match-day when Gor Mahia are playing AFC Leopards, the island’s 30,000 inhabitants could fit into the Nyayo National Stadium arena.

Takawiri, Kibwoge, Remba, Ringiti are other small fishing islands near Mfangano, all famed for their white sandy beaches. Mfangano Island has, however, suffered neglect since Kenya gained independence in 1963.

If marginalisation was to be quantified, then Mfangano residents have borne a heavy brunt. It was only as recently as October last year when the Island was visited, for the first time, by a sitting president of the Republic of Kenya.

President William Ruto, who was accompanied by Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga, visited the Island on October 6 and commissioned the improvement of the Mfangano Island Ring Road.

The highest ranked government official to have visited the Island before the President’s tour was the late Professor George Saitoti in 2001, and former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka in 2010.

Not even ODM leader Raila Odinga visited the Island when he served as a Prime Minister between 2009 and 2013, despite its heavy support for the opposition leader.

In 2009, a group of professionals from the island petitioned the Ministry of Education to be fair with the setting and administration of national exams because they felt it was unfair to students coming from the area.

The infrastructure was poor. There was not a single tarmacked road in Mfangano, and the only means of transport was walking on foot, or taking a boat ride.

“Eight of us went to Professor Karega Mutahi who was Education Permanent Secretary at the time and complained that the children from the island had not seen a tarmacked road and they were being examined on what they had not seen.

""How would you want a child who has not seen a road to write a composition about a road accident?” posed Kasujaa Onyonyi, a former Gor Mahia official who comes from the island.

Mutahi would then tour the island in a boat, accompanied by a videographer who captured the situation. He then lobbied the government to build a ring road in the tiny island.

That was the ring road President Ruto commissioned to be improved while on his five-day Nyanza tour in October.

Despite the neglect, the island has a place in the history of the country.

It made history in the 1999 Kenyan football season by producing the youngest ever Gor Mahia Chairman and Treasurer, who are blood brothers.

The island has also produced top players for Harambee Stars despite lacking sports facilities to date.

In fact, the first ever Kenyan footballer to go competitively professional in modern times, Zedekiah “Zico” Otieno – who went on to play in Oman in the 1990s - comes from the island.

Custodian Tobias Maira, Tilen Oguta, Francis Odhiambo, Felix Otieno and George “Blackberry” Odhiambo all played for Harambee Stars and Gor Mahia, and all hail from the tiny island.

George “Sollo” Otieno, who won Mandela Cup with Gor Mahia in 1987 and also turned out for Harambee Stars, and Tom Ogweno, an ex-Ulinzi Stars player, also come from Mfangano.

Kasujaa and his elder brother Vincent Onyonyi took over as Gor Mahia treasurer and chairman respectively in 1999.

It was precisely in May 1999 when a group of angry Gor Mahia fans gathered at City Stadium and confronted the club officials then led by Chairman Lesley Okudo

The fans were irked by the poor results the club was registering resulting in a relegation position on the league table.

A sweating Okudo and other officials, try as they did, could not convince the angry fans that there would be a turn around in results.

The upshot

The fans stormed the centre of the pitch and unanimously elected Kasujaa and Vincent as interim officials for the rest of the season.

Kasujaa was then 27 years old and Vincent, 30, as they accepted the role to lead the club even without consulting their families.

They say the family fully supported them when they later informed them of the decision to lead one of the biggest supported club in the region with notoriously demanding fans.

At that time Kasujaa was working as a journalist with Japan-based news agencies Kyodo while Vincent was the area sales manager for USA-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca

The duo have a chapter in K’Ogalo’s history as they saved the recently crowned 21-time Football Kenya Federation Premier League champions from relegation with just six matches to the end of the season.

“Lesley Okudo (then Gor Mahia chairman) and other officials were ejected from office because the team was going down.

“Gor were number 16 out of 18 teams and were going to be relegated with only six matches to the end of the season. We managed to win all the six matches and avoided relegation,” adds Kasujaa.

Rough patch

The two brothers talk of the rough patch they went through while rescuing K’Ogalo.

They were drained financially, at one time sold a personal car and failed to spend time with their families as they voluntarily executed their mandate without a salary.

Kasujaa narrated an incident where he had no option but to sell his car to save the situation.

Gor were going to Eldoret for a league match against Rivatex and had exhausted all its resources and Kasuja had to sell his car for Sh400,000 to hire a vehicle to help the team honour the match.

“Apart from selling my car, we travelled for the Rivatex game without a striker because of the politics at the club which had seen some players snub us.

“We won with a makeshift team. Our top goalkeeper had an accident before the match and was in goal wearing a bandage. The players then had the club at heart,” said Kasujaa.

Former Gor and Kenya defender Tobias Ochola “Jua Kali” was the coach then.

The same season, Vincent had to spend Sh350,000 after the team was held hostage in a hotel in Kisumu when they went for the finals of Hedex Super Cup against Mathare United at Kisumu’s Moi Stadium.

“Moments before we left the Rock Motel, we were locked in because of a an unpaid bill from the former office yet fans had filled the stadium and were waiting for us. We turned 'yellow'. I had to dash out and get Sh350,000,” Vincent says.

“What would you tell the fans if we had not gone to the stadium? We had prepared well and had to deliver. Had the situation not found a solution even the hotel itself would have been attacked,” added Vincent.

The two brothers opine that football has taken a great development in terms of infrastructure but says that passion and support to community clubs like Gor and AFC Leopards has since dwindled.

“The fans used to contribute money and give players cash during training sessions.

“The passion is unlike today where only a few fans attend matches. We spent money from our pockets to run the club and we don’t regret it because of the support we got,” says Vincent.

The two brothers feel that despite some minimal infrastructural improvement, Mfangano needs a modern stadium and a lot of talent enhancing programmes to tap a lot of talent.

For Gor, they feel the club is nowadays used by individuals to advance their political agenda and that is why fans should keenly watch those who are aspiring to get into office in the next FKF elections.

“Sammy Merino Owino “Kempes” is the best bet. He has football at heart and is among the players who left a history in the country,” says Kasujaa.

"Mombasa-Nairobi expressway will not hurt SGR, Murkomen assures traders","Construction of a six-lane Nairobi-Mombasa expressway that is expected to reduce travel time from Kenya’s capital to the coastal city to 4.5 hours, down from 10 and a half hours, will not affect the operations of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), the government has said.

Roads and Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said the toll-road deal, which involves a 440-kilometer link between Nairobi, and Mombasa that serves as a gateway for several East African economies will complement the existing infrastructures to make the Northern Corridor more competitive.

Mr Murkomen dismissed fears that once the toll road is ready, the SGR will be disadvantaged as cargo shifts to road transport.

He added that the SGR extension, the Mombasa-Nairobi Expressway and later Rironi-Mau Summit Expressway will make the Northern Corridor an irresistible option for many businesses in the East and Central African region.

“I am the CS of both roads and rail [and can assure you] the government has no intention of prioritising one over the other. We shall ensure rail and road provide seamless flow of cargo from the port of Mombasa to other parts of the region,” said Mr Murkomen.

Speaking during the launch of the Kenya Railways Strategic Plan 2023-2027, the CS said the railway intends to increase cargo volumes from 26 percent to 42 percent in 2027.

“We are challenging Kenya Railways to improve its services to attract more users so as to attain its vision. The government will not favour any mode of transport by issuing mandatory use of rail edicts to increase its volumes,” Mr Murkomen pledged.

The announcement comes few days after local private investors were given a chance to participate in the financing of the Sh472.9 billion expressway after the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and US-based private equity Everstron Capital LLC signed a deal to kickstart construction.

""The road, dubbed ‘Usahihi’, is expected to have four to six lanes and will be constructed over the next 3-4 years.

""Usahihi will pay its way, not burdening the government as it is structured as a Public-Private Partnership with revenue coming from road users. Usahihi will organise finance, construction, tolling, operation, and maintenance of the expressway under a 30-year concession with construction lasting 3-4 years,"" read the press release announcing the deal.

The CS spoke a day after he held a virtual meeting with US Secretary for Transportation Pete Buttigieg on several areas of cooperation, including road safety, mass rapid transport and aviation.

Also Read: Explainer: Privileges Kenya will enjoy as a Major Non-Nato Ally

Mr Murkomen and Mr Buttigieg discussed green transport in the Nairobi Metropolitan Area and explored avenues for knowledge exchange and capacity building in the sector.

Apart from the Mombasa-Nairobi expressway, the government is committed to extending the SGR from Naivasha to Malaba on the border with Uganda and beyond to enhance competitiveness of the Northern Transport Corridor.

“To this end, we will collaborate with the Interstate Ministerial Committee on the SGR Cluster to explore viable financial options to ensure that SGR extends from Malaba through Kasese in Uganda and finally Kisangani, in the DR Congo, to boost regional trade,” said Mr Murkomen.

He said the Kenya Railways Strategic Plan 2023-2027 is meant to steer the implementation of priority initiatives in the rail transport sector over the next five years.

The Plan outlines ambitious goals for Kenya Railways, including the development and enhancement of rail infrastructure, expansion of freight and passenger transport, increasing market share of the port of Mombasa, fostering a skilled workforce, and institutionalising Environmental, Social, and Governance standards.

Why law requires seizing suspected rabies animals,"May 4, 2024 shall remain etched in my memory as one of the days I handled a case with possible devastating consequences, that fortunately never materialised.

I was busy doing a report when Emily, our admin, alerted me of boys with a sick dog in the waiting room.

She asked me to quickly attend to the animal as the children said the dog had bouts of fainting. In her opinion, the animal was very ill. She said the doctor on duty was busy with another patient while Dr Mwikali had already left for a house visit.

I trust Emily’s judgment and case scheduling because her many years of experience and operational training have positioned her to organise patients for the doctors available at any time at the clinic.

Newly-qualified doctors and students, encountering her in action for the first time, ask how she manages the work without formal animal health training.

I explain that professionals need to understand and appreciate that operational management is common in all fields of practice and is better carried out by people who are not trained in the particular discipline as long as they are initially trained in administration and well-trained in operations of the specific professional service they are employed in.

Read: Do not confuse this cow disease with deadly rabies

I found seven boys in the waiting room. One was holding a dog on a leash. The animal was coiled up under a seat and looked oblivious of its environment.

The boys appeared under 14 years. One stood out as the obvious leader of the troop.

He smiled, stood up and extended his hand to greet me.

I clenched my fist and gave him a “corona” greeting. The dog’s posture and red eyes immediately raised my rabies antennae. Greeting the boy with an open hand could expose me to the rabies virus.

Saliva foam

Emily gave me a disapproving look and shrugged out of sight of the children. She later explained to me she thought my action was customer unfriendly. She had quickly changed her mind when she heard me tell the boys to thoroughly wash and disinfect their hands immediately.

The dog was a rabies suspect and the boys who had handled it were probably exposed to the virus.

One of the boys said he had wiped off saliva foam from the dog’s mouth with his bare hands to keep the animal clean.

Francis, the band leader, demanded to know why I thought the dog was rabid, yet it appeared very calm and had not attacked them.

They had walked with the animal for about two kilometres. The only thing they observed was weakness in the hind quarters and the animal would tire easily and collapse.

That was the only reason they had brought it to the clinic.

Readers of this column may recall I have narrated cases of rabies in cattle and dogs.

However, each has a different perspective that helps understand the various aspects of the deadly disease.

Read:   Beware, that beloved dairy cow could kill you

In this case, the history of hind leg weakness, frothing at the mouth, dullness and inability to swallow two doughnuts the boys had given the dog were rabies infection red flags.

The red eyes I observed, even without touching the dog, further enhanced my suspicion.

After getting the history and making observations, I secured the dog with a catcher, fitted the mouth with a muzzle and continued examining it closely.

The eyes were very red, there was dried saliva on the lips and two bite wounds on the face. The lymph nodes were swollen and the dog had lots of ticks. The animal failed the water test.

Dogs with rabies show hydrophobia or fear of water. They turn away their heads when water is presented to them to drink.

This reaction is caused by a painful throat due to paralysis of swallowing muscles caused by rabies infection. Even water swirling causes the dog to turn its head away from the direction of the sound.



Rabies infection

I took some blood for in-house lab analysis. The results showed dehydration and some blood parasites spread by ticks. It is the parasites that had caused the swelling of the lymph nodes.

I treated the dog for the dehydration and blood parasites. I then explained to the children that their innocence had made them vulnerable to rabies infection.

They had seen a dog mistreated by other children and made to fight another dog. That is how the animal got the bite wounds on the face.

The boys had decided to bring the dog for treatment at the clinic, oblivious of the danger they were in.

Fortunately, the animal had the dumb form of rabies where the patient is deeply depressed and prefers to coil and rest.

I told the boys that the animal would remain at the clinic until we confirmed if it had rabies or not.

They protested they only had Sh100 and could not afford the treatment and admission cost.

I explained the matter was no longer about money but their safety, that of their community and the other animals in the village, including cows, goats and pigs.

The law requires us to impound all rabies-suspected animals presented at the clinic, confirm the disease and report to the veterinary and health authorities.

We agreed with the children that they would bring their parents to the clinic because they could not legally make decisions.

On May 7, the National Veterinary Research Laboratories in Kabete confirmed the dog indeed had rabies.

The rabies confirmation report started a new cascade of events that are ongoing. I shall narrate it in future.

 ,"My name is Felix. I live in Nakuru town and I am married with two children. I am employed as a contract employee with a net salary of Sh38,000.

My expenses are as follows: Rent Sh10,000, food Sh12,000, special shopping for my last born infant baby Sh5,000, airtime Sh2,000, transport Sh1,600, water and power bills Sh1,200. The remaining amount has been going to savings, miscellaneous expenditures and black tax. Together with my wife, we have saved Sh250,000 in a bank account.

My wife runs a printing, cyber and MPesa shop in town. This shop has been making Sh10,000 monthly after paying rent. However, similar shops have mushroomed around her and she wants me to take a loan of between Sh800,000 and Sh1 million and convert it into an electronics and phones business.

I am not sure if this is a good idea for us. Should we go for it?



Chacha Nyaigoti Bichang’a, a financial coach at Chachanomics Consulting Firm and the author of Mastering Your Money, says:

Before addressing your dilemma on whether to start an electronics business or not, let us first examine your actual financial position. Your total expenditure is Sh22,200 against your net salary of Sh38,000.

This leaves you with a balance of Sh15,800 which is roughly spent on savings, miscellaneous expenses and black tax. From your breakdown, it is not clear how much goes into these expense items. This implies that you neither operate with a spending plan nor track your money after spending.

You need a comprehensive audit of your financial lifestyle to determine your net worth (sum total of your assets minus liabilities), find out whether you are living within your means or not, and identify what you can do to earn more money from both your job and business.

You need to work with a clear spending plan or budget that contains details of your expenditure items and be able to track where your money goes on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. By doing so, you will determine areas where you need to cut down on unnecessary expenditure.

For instance, your expenditure on rent of Sh10,000 (26 per cent) supersedes the recommended average of 15 per cent (Sh5,700).

This would necessitate moving to a cheaper house of about Sh6,000 or Sh7,000 and save about Sh3,000, and or boosting up your income to make up for the shortfall if your circumstances really cannot allow you to move to a cheaper house.

Food expenses of Sh12,000 (32 per cent) surpass the recommended average of 20 per cent (Sh7,600).

This might be plausible given the increase in prices of commodities. But you can still get discounts by buying foodstuffs in bulk especially when in season for cereals, and storing them well. You can save around Sh4,000.

You can equally reduce spending on airtime by Sh500 to Sh1,000 once you buy a monthly package.

If you can institute these cuts on your expenditures, you will save about Sh8,000 which can be channeled to savings for emergencies or investment.

Second, you need to save at least 20 per cent of your income – according to the 80/20 rule. This translates to a round figure of Sh8,000.

This leaves you with Sh7,800 from the remaining amount of Sh15,800 as per your financial breakdown.

This amount can be saved in a Sacco or Money Market Fund. You need to diversify your savings into various vehicles to meet your financial obligations and investment goals.

Therefore, saving in a Sacco and MMF comes in handy. Consider channeling your bank savings of Sh250,000 to a compound interest-earning money market fund manager offering at least 13 per cent as per the prevailing market rates.

Ensure, you channel monthly deposits of around Sh8,000 so that in three years you will have realised a gross sum of Sh710,817.

You can also go for a reputable Sacco with dividends above 10 per cent to benefit from interest as well as possibility of financing using the 3X multiplier effect.

Third, audit your wife’s cyber and MPesa business. Review the business’ monthly income versus expenditure. Ensure proper accounting and bookkeeping are done.

It is not clear how much is paid on rent and other operational expenses like your wife’s salary. It is important to determine how much the business should pay your wife as salary depending on the business performance or profitability.

How is the profit utilised? Is there a separate bank account for the business? Is the profit ploughed back or used for your wife’s personal upkeep?

Competition from similar mushrooming business ventures may not be a big challenge once you have cultivated a reliable business niche and built a loyal clientele. Meanwhile, consider reviewing and rebranding your current business as you assess the possibility of expanding it.

Fourth, before you take a loan to start the new electronics business, consider a number of factors.

One, identify the big WHY propelling you to launch the new business. Ask yourself: Why are we starting an electronics’ business? What problem do we intend to solve considering the existing market trends? Do we have the required passion and skill set to manage the business?

Conduct an intensive market survey to establish the existing gap, needs and demands of customers.

Two, come up with a workable business plan that spells the framework of your business in terms of exact business location, products to sell (such as smartphones, laptops, TVs, radios), legal structure, unique selling points, risk analysis, market analysis, personnel, marketing strategies, pricing, financing options, operations, managing business finances and the like.

Your biggest dilemma Is how to finance the business. If you were to opt for a bank loan of about Sh800,000 to Sh1 million, you have to bear in mind your repayment ability, total cost of the loan (principal plus interest) and duration of loan repayment.

Your salary alone may not be enough to finance the bank loan.

Your current business too will strain on account of its low profitability. Consider using the joint bank account savings to improve the existing business for a higher profit which you can save for one year or so before securing a loan to expand the business after conducting due diligence.

I earn Sh25,000,and have no savings despite working for two years; should I quit and go for a house-help job in Saudi Arabia?

My name is Joyce. I am turning 26 and I earn Sh30,000 and after deductions it gets to around Sh25,000 (I also get small monthly commissions that range from Sh1,000 to Sh4,000 but they are not guaranteed). I live with my mum (I am thinking of moving out) so I handle most of the monthly expenses. My transport to and from work is between Sh3,200 and Sh4,000 a month and I also tithe. I don’t have any savings despite working for two years. By the end of every month, I find myself in small debts of up to Sh10,000 that I can’t explain. Most are mobile phone app debts. My dream is to build my mum a house and get a side hustle, but with my current earnings I don’t think I will ever achieve this. I am now considering paying an agent to get work in Saudi Arabia as a house help. I have seen women who have built rentals back home from such jobs despite the risk. Is this a good move? Should I quit my job and go for it? If not, how do I manage my small money to achieve my dream?

Building wealth and achieving goals such as constructing a home for your mother take time. With proper planning, financial discipline and patience, you can reach these and many other aspirations. Since you are young, you have ample time to learn, fulfil your dreams and succeed financially.

The first step you need to take to achieve your goals is to establish the right financial discipline, starting with a budget. One effective method of establishing a budget is the 50:30:20 rule. This approach allocates 50 per cent of your disposable income to basic expenses such as transportation, food and other necessities. Another 30 per cent goes towards your wants (discretionary spending) and the remaining 20 per cent is saved or invested.

Given that your transport expense is Sh4,000, you can allocate Sh6,000 for monthly shopping and home support. Additionally, set aside Sh2,500 for unforeseen expenses, bringing your total needs budget to Sh12,500 or 50 per cent of your income. Next, budget Sh7,500 for discretionary spending on items like apparel and entertainment. The remaining Sh5,000 or 20 per cent of your income should be saved.

Once you’ve established a budget, you then need to develop the discipline to stick to it. One effective strategy for establishing budget discipline is to allocate funds immediately upon receiving your income. For example, you can do your monthly shopping, tithe, contribute to your savings fund and make other necessary payments right away. Then use a mobile app to allocate and manage your daily expenditure.

Another method is the envelope system. Label envelopes for each expense category such as transport, home shopping and personal care. At the beginning of the month, withdraw your income and place the designated amounts in each envelope to help manage your spending.

If sticking to your budget is a challenge, consider getting accountability from a trusted friend or relative.

As you establish this discipline, grow your savings to achieve your goals. Your first goal should be to get out of debt. Use your savings from the first two months to pay off all mobile loans so that you do not need to take on new debt to get through the month. Once you are free from mobile debt, keep off these loans to avoid being in a debt cycle as this will keep you from progressing financially.

Once out of debt, work on investing to raise capital for your side hustle. I would advise you to consider investing your savings in a Money Market Fund or Bond Fund account. These investment products offer an annual interest rate of between 12 per cent and 15 per cent while providing easy access to your funds. Research on the various fund managers available to find your best option. To build your saving discipline, I would advise you to invest for at least one to two years as you raise capital for your side business.

Once you have achieved this goal, you can now start saving towards building your mother a house. You can consider saving with a Sacco so that you can access a loan and accelerate this goal. Do your research on available Saccos to find the ideal one for your savings.

Developing strong financial discipline is more critical to your financial success than simply increasing your income. I would therefore advise you to focus on building the discipline rather than quitting your job to relocate to work as a house-help in Saudi. Note, if you don’t get a grip on your money here, moving to Saudi will not improve your saving and spending habits. Also bear in mind the implications of making such a move, including costs, emotional readiness, and the career you’re establishing in Kenya and its future progression.

 ,"The moment Juliana got married, her husband persuaded her to stop working. He jokingly said that she was too beautiful and men in the office would “disturb” her. Because of his insistence, Juliana resigned from her job.

She was expectant and tired at that time anyway and was barely coping with work.

Her husband thereafter developed a habit of shopping for her. He said she needed to rest at home and that there was no need for her to go to shop.

Progressively the man started checking her messages on the phone. He would sometimes call back anyone who had talked to Juliana during the day and if it was a man, there would be war in the house.

She was not allowed to call any man because her husband believed she had a “secret affair!”

Juliana used to take the child to the clinic on her own but this is no longer the case. Her husband insisted on accompanying her just in case the “secret lover” met her on the way.

What worried Juliana was that her husband had hired a security firm not just to keep security around the house but to also monitor her movements and arrest “her lover” whom the man believed came to the house when he was at work.

Further, her husband had stopped her from making her hair and nails and had confiscated some of her clothes because “they made her look too sexy and seductive.”

Now, the man is threatening Juliana with death. He has severally said that his sixth sense tells him that Juliana is sleeping around with a neighbor. He is threatening to kill her if he confirms the suspicion.

“I can’t figure out any reason why he is making this wild allegation,” Juliana said on phone. “What is scaring me most is that he is referring to some recent femicide cases that have been in the media and telling me that I will soon end up like those women.”

Juliana opted for a phone consultation because she would never be allowed to leave the house. She had also learned to delete phone records to keep her safe in case her husband checked her phone later.

Now in her early 30s, Juliana and her husband Andrew have been married for seven years. What started as a happy marriage marked by a grand wedding was turning out to be one hell of a life. Juliana had toyed with various options of getting off Andrew’s hook, including suicide.

“I decided to consult with you because I am about to make a decision,” she said. “I have to get out of this bondage.”

Following a thorough assessment, my conclusion was that Juliana had no secret lover and had no intention of being unfaithful.

I would have wanted to talk to Andrew and possibly do couple therapy but, of course, that would land Juliana in very serious trouble.

“Most likely he will say that you are my boyfriend,” Juliana said.

Whatever the case, I had to make a diagnosis, even if provisional, and find a way of rescuing Juliana.

I diagnosed that Andrew was suffering from pathological jealousy, also known as obsessional jealousy, or sexual jealousy.

This is a situation where a person has an intense but false feeling of being cheated on.

They have a deep feeling of being tricked and deceived. They see every move as aimed at tricking them and accumulate false evidence to prove their point.

They go all out to respond to this perceived threat accordingly, spending money and time to prove their case as well as “guard against further cheating”.

Pathological jealousy is more common in men, making women the most caged.

Women should be alert for this disease if the man in your life is always asking for your whereabouts, finding reason to believe that you were with another man, restricting you from talking to any man, confining you so that you do not meet any men, checking for uncalled for evidence of non-existent extramarital affairs, drawing false conclusions that you are being unfaithful, and fiercely developing strategies to control and monitor your movements.

In severe cases, the obsession may stop the man from doing his work and he may stop working to spend time monitoring the woman.

There have been many instances of femicide of late. No research has been done to find out what makes men kill the women they say they love. Pathological jealousy is one possible reason for the killings.

Resolving pathological jealousy on your own can be difficult. It is important to seek the intervention of a professional early. Should the man become violent or threaten to kill at any point, it is safer to disengage and stay away to keep safe.

This is unfortunate but necessary because the sick man will threaten and mete small acts of violence before finally terminating your life. If they are amenable to therapy then follow that route as a matter of urgency.

 ,"We all have unfinished love stories. If you are the type that wrung out every emotion and all feelings for your ex-lover, good for you, because for the majority of divorced men, moving on is never easy.

Any mention of their former lovers reminds them of the painful journey that began in love, joy and happiness, and ended in pain, regret, and resentment. Resentment over broken promises, broken families, unrequited love and a story that may never get finished.

In a society where men often hesitate to express their emotions, Saturday Magazine asked five previously married men to share their innermost thoughts about the people they once called ‘wife.’ Each lays bare his unique sorrow, hurt and disappointment, the goal being to reconcile their past, seek closure and express their regrets and frustrations with the ones they once held dear.

Dear Ex-Wife

I hope this letter finds you well, although I doubt you care much about my well-being anymore.

It's been three years since our marriage crumbled, but I am still bitter. I keep wondering why you left me. I did everything that you asked me to, but you left. You promised me so many things. But one promise that I'm unlikely to forget is that you would be my life partner. How does a life partner cause so much pain to someone they claim they love?

I wish you could understand the magnitude of the hurt you inflicted upon me. Maybe then I could find closure and finally move on.

I have so many questions with no answers. These questions have made it hard for me to move on, even to date.

I fear that this new woman will drag me into another emotional pit, again. Sometimes I dream. I see you. I wonder if this will give me closure.

I miss you, not just for the love we once shared, but for the partnership we forged. There are things I cannot say out loud. I cannot confide in anyone that I miss the sound of your laughter, your warm body and hugs, the moments we shared...

But despite the ache in my heart, I wish you the best. May you find happiness and fulfillment. Perhaps you have found peace, which has escaped me.

-- John



Dear Ex-Wife

Never in this world or any other would I have imagined that you and I would be among the couples going through divorce.

And never did I ever think that one day you would become an ex of mine. Throughout the nine years, we created the most beautiful memories. I’ve never loved anyone like this before, and although I am the reason we parted ways, I will forever hold the memories dear. I know I messed up and hurt you deeply, but I was dealing with midlife crisis. I am so sorry. I am still learning.

All I ever wanted was to have a beautiful family and a peaceful home, and you made all of that come true. You made so many of my dreams come true. I wanted nothing more than to be the best husband, a romantic lover, the most selfless provider, and one day, the world's best dad.

I failed you, I failed our children, and I failed myself. My dear Grace, I hope one day you will forgive me.

Although we are no longer together, your happiness remains my top priority. Seeing you happy brings me immense joy. Although our paths have split, the memories we created together remain cherished and irreplaceable.

As for me? I am content and at peace, believe it or not. Work keeps me occupied more than ever. Guess what? I have discovered a new passion for beekeeping. I am in the process of rebuilding this life that has previously been shattered. I still harbour dreams of starting a family and being a present father, and my longing for love and genuine happiness persists.

The only thing I can say is thank you for giving me the best children in this world.

-- Morris

Dear Ex-Wife

It's hard for me to find the right words to tell you how disappointed I am in you. You were supposed to be my support, but you ended up hurting me so much. Your betrayal hurt me, and I don't know if I can ever fully heal from it.

I often look at our daughter and wish she never turns out to be like you, her mother. I thought I knew who you were, but it turns out you were just pretending to be someone you're not, for a whole year! Why did you do that?

I hope you realise the damage you caused. We could have had something great if you had just been honest. Honest about your past, about your children from the previous relationships, and especially about the kind of job you do to survive. But you chose to lie to me, and that destroyed everything good that could have come out of our union. I hope I never see you again.

-- Mike



Dear Ex-Wife

I want to take this moment to acknowledge the positive impact you had on my life for 12 years, despite the way things ended between us. You were there for me during some of my darkest moments. You offered me support and encouraged me through so many challenges. You always knew what to say and always came to my aid when I needed it most.

I am sorry I was reckless. I was ignorant and arrogant, and I did not acknowledge your feelings. Not only did I hurt you, but I hurt our children. It kills me to know that I have set a bad example for them, and I am sorry. I regret everything and I wish I could tell you that in person, but I lack the courage to do so. I miss your gentleness and how you would submit wholeheartedly to me. I am sorry.

I found another wife, Lena, with whom I have two children. However, with respect I have to tell you that despite my new status as a married man, I wish that things between us remain cordial. I also want to send my deepest apologies to you for breaking the promises I made to you during our marriage. I am sorry. Looking back, I think I just wasn’t ready for marriage. I think I am now, and I am determined to make my new marriage work. I hope you don’t hold that against me.

I am taking this chance to redeem myself by being the best husband to this new wife that God has brought my way.

Thank you for being a part of my journey and for teaching me valuable lessons about love, resilience, and the importance of forgiveness. I wish you nothing but the best in all your future endeavours.

Warmest regards,

-- Peter

Dear Ex-Wife,

Honestly, I don’t have words for you, I am still trying to heal from the wounds you left me with. By the way, tell your mother and your relatives to leave me alone.

Tell them the truth about why we broke up and what you did. I have not told them anything out of respect for you, although you don’t deserve it, but if they don’t stop calling me and coming to my house, I will tell them what you did.

And as you tell them the truth, let them know that there is no you and I, and we shall never and can never get back together. I can’t bear living with a lying, cheating, careless parasite like you.

I will not allow you to come near my children unless you get clean from those prescription drugs and from alcohol. It is hard to take care of them alone but it is better than taking care of both the children and you. You have chosen your bed, and you have chosen to elope with another man. Now lie in it.

Have a nice life!

-- Edward

Paris Olympics trials: Just who’ll blink first?,"The Kenyan trials in 10,000 metres for the Paris Olympic Games will take the limelight at the Prefontaine Classic scheduled for tonight at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon in the United States of America.

And some fast times are expected in both the men’s and women’s 25-lap race, especially with the additional Ethiopian flavour in the women’s battle. The programme starts at 10.40pm (Kenyan time), with the women’s 10,000m race taking place from 10.50pm. Men’s 10,000m race will take place from 12.05am, and men’s 100m early tomorrow (1.12am). Women’s 800m race will be run tomorrow morning from 2.34am.

Two-time reigning world cross country champion Beatrice Chebet, who is the world 5km, the world cross country champion and world 5km silver medallist Lilian Kasait, will once again take on each other at the stacked Olympic trials.

World half marathon silver medallist Margaret Chelimo, world half marathon bronze medallist Catherine Reline and the 10km world record holder Agnes Jebet Ng’etich are also in the mix.

Emmaculate Anyango, who rose to fame this year to represent the country for the first time at the World Cross Country Championships and Grace Nawowuna, who competed at the World Cross Country and World Championships last year, are on the start list.

Commonwealth Games 10,000m bronze medallist Selah Jepleting also joins the party. Apart from Kasait, who is eying her second Olympic Games appearance after finishing 12th in 5,000m at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games, the rest hope to make their first Games appearance.

Interestingly, world 10,000m champion Gudaf Tsegay from Ethiopia will join the Kenyans but on a different mission - to continue her record-breaking form.

Tsegay won

After downing Faith Kipyegon’s 5,000m world record of 14:05.20 within two weeks last year with a new time of 14:00.21, Tsegay took a shot at the Kenyan’s 1,500m world record of 3:49.11 at the Doha Diamond League on April 20 this year.

The Olympic Games 5,000m bronze medalist, who ran a superb 3:50.30 to win in Doha, will be taking a shot at the 10,000m world record held by fellow Ethiopian Letesenbet Gidey of 29:01.03 from 2021 Hengelo.

The 2023 world 10,000m silver medallist Daniel Ebenyo, who has the event’s leading time this year, and Benson Kiplangat, the 2021 world Under 20 champion, are among the Kenyan men to look out for. Both events are non-Diamond League races.

The 2022 world 10,000m silver medallist Stanley Waithaka and Nicholas Kimeli, who finished fourth in 5,000m at the Tokyo Olympics and world cross country this year, are also on the men's start list.

Kibiwott Kandie, the former world half marathon record holder and Commonwealth Games 10,000m bronze medallist, the 2021 world under-20 10,000m champion, and Samuel Chebolei, who finished fifth at world cross country this year, are among others to look out for.

Chebolei is also joined by his elder brother Ronald Kwemoi, who represented Kenya in 1,500m at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, finishing 13th in the final and Daniel Mateiko, who finished eighth in 10,000m at the 2022 World Championships.

Kimeli and Simiu were part of a trio that represented Kenya in 5,000m at the Tokyo Olympic Games, where they finished fourth and 12th, respectively and will be eying their second appearance at the Summer Games.

“It’s every athlete’s dream to be at the Olympics and I hope to perform well,” said Simiu, who upon settling for silver at the World Half Marathon in Latvia, declared that it was the last time that Kenyans would see him winning silver as he plans an assault in 10,000m at the Paris Olympics.

With home athlete Olympic 800m gold medallist Athing Mu out of the race, the focus is now on the reigning world 800m champion, Mary Moraa, in the 800m.

Moraa, who won the Doha Diamond League in 1:57.91 on May 10 before cracking 50.56 in 400m at the Los Angeles Grand Prix on May 18, will test herself against Keely Hodkinson, the Tokyo 2020 Olympics 800m silver medallist.

“My target is to run good times from what I have done this year, “said Moraa, who won the Kip Keino Classic in 1:57.96 and Doha in 1:57.91.

Africa record holder Ferdinand Omanyala will take on three-time world champion medallist Christian Coleman, the Olympic silver medallist Kenny Bednarek and the reigning World Indoor 60m bronze medallist Jamaican Ackeem Blake in 100m.

Coleman won the race last year, beating world champion Noah Lyles and Omanyala to second and third places, respectively.

More than 300 buried in Papua New Guinea landslide,"Sydney

More than 300 people and over 1,100 houses were buried by a massive landslide that levelled a remote village in northern Papua New Guinea, local media reported on Saturday.

Hundreds are feared dead in the landslide that hit Kaokalam village in Enga Province, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of capital Port Moresby, around 3am on Friday (1900 GMT on Thursday).

The landslide in the Pacific nation north of Australia buried more than 300 people and 1,182 houses, the Papua New Guinea Post Courier said, citing comments from a member of the country's parliament, Aimos Akem. Akem did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment via social media.

More than six villages had been impacted by the landslide in the province's Mulitaka region, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said on Saturday.

""Australia’s High Commission in Port Moresby is in close contact with PNG authorities for further assessments on the extent of the damage and casualties,"" a DFAT spokesperson said in a statement.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported on Saturday that four bodies had been retrieved from the area after emergency teams reached the sparsely populated area, where the death toll is expected to rise.

The landslide has blocked highway access, making helicopters the only way to reach the area, the broadcaster reported.

Social media footage posted by villager Ninga Role showed people clambering over rocks, uprooted trees and mounds of dirt searching for survivors. Women could be heard weeping in the background.

Prime Minister James Marape has said disaster officials, the Defence Force and the Department of Works and Highways were assisting with relief and recovery efforts.

Kenya’s ‘Hit Squad’ on the ropes with final chance to punch 2024 Paris ticket,"If there is one qualification that is making hearts of genuine boxing fans in Kenya skip a heart beat, it is the elimination tournament at The Indoor Stadium Huamark in Bangkok, Thailand.

This world qualifier, that started yesterday and runs unto June 2, is the last opportunity for the hitherto-feared “Hit Squad” to punch a ticket to the Paris Olympic Games.

The six Kenyans who are hoping to turn their lifelong Olympic dreams into reality include female fighters Amina Martha (bantamweight), Friza Anyango (welterweight) and veteran Elizabeth Andiego (middleweight).

The men's brigade has Edwin Okong’o (light-heavyweight), Boniface Mogunde (light-middleweight) and newcomer Peter Abuti (heavyweight).

The technical bench has head coach Musa Benjamin, David Munuhe (deputy coach) and John Waweru (trainer) who are all International Boxing Association (IBA) three–star coaches.

More than 600 elite boxers from 133 different countries will be battling for a spot in the Paris Olympic Games 2024 scheduled to take place from July 26 to August 11.

A total of 51 (23 for women and 28 for men) Paris 2024 Olympic quota places are available in this qualifiers.

Winners in each category together with first and second runners up will earn their passage to the Games

Die-hard boxing fans in Kenya have every reason to worry considering no boxer from the country has secured their place in the Games thus far.

So the Bangkok tour is literally a do-or-die affair for the six fighters.

Kenya’’s tale of missed chances started on September 9-15 at the Dakar Arena, Senegal where all the country’s boxers flopped.

The pattern was repeated at the first World Qualification Tournament in Busto Arsizio, Italy, from 3 to 11 March 2024.

The worried boxing fans are aware that anything short of a first three placing at The Indoor Stadium will mean Kenya pugilists not climbing the North Paris Arena and at Roland-Garros Stadium where the boxing tournament will be held in Paris.

The stark reality is that Kenya is at the risk of failing to have a boxer at the Olympic Games for the first time since 1964 when five represented the country

The “Hit Squad” made their maiden appearance in the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games where the late Philip Waruinge from Nakuru and Alex Oundu finished ninth overall in the featherweight and lightweight categories respectively.

The Other Kenyan boxers at the 1964 Games were John Kamau (flyweight), John Olulu (light welter) and Gichere Gakungu (welterweight).

Kenya boycotted the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada and the 1980 Moscow Games due to political reasons.

Celebrated international boxing referee and judge Joseph Mwangi Muthoga popularly known as “Don King” who has officiated in the Commonwealth Games, five editions of the All African Games, the 2008 Beijing Olympics and at numerous international says the lack of youthful boxers may be Kenya’s undoing .

“The average age of our boxers is 30 years while our opponents from Europe, Asia and the US are 20 years. Kenyans boxers cannot match their speed and agility in the ring. Our opponents have graduated through the youth development,” said Muthoga.

At the same time, he said officiating in the international qualifiers is key.

“African referees and judges are very few and don’t get equal opportunities like their counterparts in Europe and Asia. It is important for Africa to have enough officials in such qualifiers because you can’t rule out the possibilities of officials ganging up to favour their teams,” said Muthoga who qualified as IBA referee/judge in 1994 in South Africa.

He added: “The final qualification is in Asia and I worry that officials from Asia may collude and favour their fighters who did not qualify in Italy.”

However, Muthoga who is a two-star IBA referee/judge blamed African governments for failing to support the advancement of boxing referees and judges in their countries.

“Development of referees and judges in Africa is zero. African government must go back on the drawing board and ensure we have many qualified international referees and judges to counter Europe and Asia.”

He said the failure of qualified IBA international referees and judges to accompany ‘Hit Squad’ in competitions outside the country due to lack of funds denied them the much needed exposure.

However, he said the six-member ‘Hit Squad’ has what it takes to qualify for the Paris Olympics as they had gained relatively good exposure last year and this year.

“12 members of the team went to Havana, Cuba last year for special training where they got the required exposure, which is very rare to come. If you add the Italy and Dakar qualifiers, Kenya should not miss victory in the Bangkok qualifiers,” said Muthoga.

“I have officiated Okong’o. He’s a powerful boxer with a vision. Mugunde is an equally skilful boxer while the rest are also perfect according to their records,” said Muthoga.

Muthoga said Kenya lacks junior boxing and women development strategies to prepare budding boxers for international assignments.

“Boxing should start at the school level but when we have primary and secondary school games boxing is not featured and that is where there is a weak link in the development of this game. Counties should invest in boxing through inter-county games to raise our standards,” observed Muthoga.

Super clash of the big cats,"Two-time champions Cheetahs and Lions have made tactical changes ahead of their Rugby Super Series final clash today from 4pm at the RFUEA ground, in Nairobi.

Lion’s head coach Oliver Mang’eni, though, has opted for minimal changes, putting his trust in the side that stunned Buffaloes 20-5 in their preliminary round encounter in Kakamega.

Emmanuel Silungi takes over from Collins Kabayo, who drops to the bench at second row while Bob Muhati takes up the inside centre position replacing Charles Twandam, who moves to outside centre replacing Kennedy Claude.

However, Cheetahs coach Lawrence Buyachi has made seven changes, replacing Kevin Kiget and Brian Onyango with Francis Atiti and Desterious Ifedha as props.

Clinton Odhiambo replaces Barry Opondo as second row where he will partner with Tyson Okoth while Elkeans Musonye returns to replace Nelson Tengeye at number eight.

Seasoned former international Samson Onsomu takes charge at scrum-half, replacing youngster James Muthoni while Kenya Under-20 Philip Okeyo comes in for Javan Okwaro at centre where he will be paired with Tyson Maina.

Beldad Ogeta comes to the left wing instead of Alvin Khavoli’s while Dennis Abukuse will operate from right.

Lions, who have won the title once, are keen on gaining revenge on Cheetahs who beat them 18-16 a fortnight ago.

Lions won the title last in 2008 while Cheetahs clinched the second and fourth edition in 2004 and 2006 respectively.

Mang’eni said that his boys are yearning for revenge, having amended the mistakes they committed in their loss to Cheetahs in the series opener.

“We were lethargic and slow in reaction. More so, we didn’t take one-on-one tackles,” said Mang’eni.

Mang’eni reckoned one doesn’t change a winning outfit after he opted for minimal and tactical changes to the squad.

“Claude was red carded in our last match hence his replacement while Silungi’s return is tactical owing to his strong presence in the scrum,” said Mang’eni.

Buyachi expects quite a competitive and entertaining match of direct and running rugby.

""Cat fights are always vicious. We we shall be out to do what we are known for - play good rugby,"" said Buyachi.

He said he had made several changes after resting most of his players in their previous match, having already qualified for the final.

""We wanted freshness in the final match and more so give all the players some airtime,"" explained Buyachi.

Seasoned referee Constant Cap will be in charge of the duel assisted by Duncan Kioko and Kevin Wambugu.

 ,"A river that burst its banks during the recent floods in Mukuru flows near people’s houses, carrying debris and filth. A stench fills the air. Breathing is a Herculean, especially for a visitor.

Next to the river water is rubble of destroyed houses. Debris that once formed parts of warm homes is all one can see.

Men are hauling the remains of their houses and household items to makeshift homes for the night.

The wounds of the demolitions by the government are still fresh and may never heal.

Authorities demolished hundreds of shacks that many called home following President William Ruto’s directive, leaving thousands homeless. The government said it was enforcing resettlement notices issued to families living on riparian land in Nairobi.

Next to Mukuru Kayaba’s open ditches and sewage, children run around with no houses to call their own.

The hundreds of children are on a mission: to scavenge for items from the places they called home and sell them. They then take the little money earned to their parents to buy a plate of githeri – boiled mixture of maize and beans.

Mr Bonface Ouko, who owns the metal loaded onto a lorry, was the caretaker of his brother’s rental property before the demolitions.

He accuses the government of terrorising citizens.

Mr Ouko shows the Saturday Nation team the places residents are struggling to salvage whatever they can before earthmovers arrive to tear down the still standing structures.

“It is a severe blow. In the many years we have lived here, nothing like this has happened. We have been messed up. The house has been our source of income since 2013 when my brother built it,” he says.

The demolitions could not have come at a worse time for Mr Ouko. As the family was still recovering from the destruction caused by floods, the earthmovers arrived. He now stares at a huge burden as the schools his children go to have increased fees.

“We have lived as a community in good and bad times. Things have never been this bad, not even during the 2007/2008 post-election violence. Families here have lost hope. It is a catastrophe to be reduced to nothing when you were a landlord,” he says.

Then we stumble on Ms Margaret Ngina’s mabati shack which has survived – perhaps for now – because her pleas. The 70-year-old has 10 children who live with her in three single rooms. Ms Ngina arrived home as the earthmovers were about to flatten her house a week ago.

She says the people in charge of the demolitions were touched by her cries, though the septuagenarian does not know her fate in the days to come.

She has lived in Mukuru for 60 years. It is here that she raised her children. Her husband died 20 years ago.

Many of Mr Ngina’s neighbours have asked her to leave the slum and retire to the countryside, but her family has no land.

Her mother moved to Nairobi when still young. The elderly woman says she cannot trace her roots.

“Some people think I am insane. I feed most of the children you see here but they are not even related to me,” she says.

To make matters worse for the granny, one of her daughters is mentally challenged.

Ms Ngina has moved from one hospital to another seeking her daughter’s treatment for 17 years.

The elderly woman uses crutches as she has arthritis and ulcers. She has fractured her leg three times.

Her household is not financially sound as the adult children have no stable jobs.

“Before becoming sick, I used to sell vegetables and githeri. Now we have no option but to beg,” she says.

The Saturday Nation team remained around to witness the gruelling transition from day to night with no house to sit in, eat from or sleep.

The hundreds of families that have not moved out are in the open, exposed to the elements.

It is 6.50pm, and the sun is resting behind huge dark clouds. The displaced Mukuru families are bracing themselves for a new downpour. Night and rain tag along with anguish written on the women’s faces. Shivering children struggle to find sleep.

“Isn’t it enough that we are homeless? Does it have to rain?” one asks dejectedly.

They rummage for sticks from the rubble and light a fire to keep them warm at night.

Ms Talia Achieng is at one of the fire circles with her five-month-old baby wrapped in a blanket. She is sitting at the exact spot her house stood.

The woman has known no other home for more than 20 years. The baby is oblivious of her mother’s sullen face and fatigue. Mr Achieng says she does not know where she and her child will end up. The father of the baby was sent to prison months ago over a crime Achieng says she does not know.

“My baby was fast asleep in the house when the bulldozers made their way here. We didn’t know they would reach our house. When we realised what was happening, we had to stop them quickly and save my daughter,” she says.

The women take turns to carry the baby throughout the night. Whoever has the infant must sit closest to the fire. The baby is kept under a shade of iron sheets when she sleeps during the day.

Ms Achieng is a nursing mother but cannot afford meals. Even getting a cup tea in the morning is a mountain to climb.

“I and those who used to be our neighbours before the demolitions now live together as one big family. Whoever wakes up first is in charge of the day’s meal. If that person gets nothing, we go without meals on that day and hope for a fruitful search the following day,” she says.

Bathrooms and other necessities have become a luxury. The most affected are women. They wait until midnight to take a bath in the dark as they have to use the few toilets around.

“We have not received help from the government. Mukuru Kwa Kayaba, a public primary school, provides us with lunch on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,” Ms Achieng says, adding she hopes to become an engineer and give her daughter the life that she never had.

Ms Pauline Njoki, a mother of four, prays for shelter daily.

“They demolished our house, making us homeless. During flooding, we could remain in the house until the water receded. The floods did not make us homeless. We even moved out of the houses to higher ground but returned,” she says.

“The 48-hour notice from the government was too short for us to get a new home. When the house was torn down, we moved to Kenya Railways land and begged the guards to allow us in as we look for a way out of this situation.”

Ms Njoki adds that finding a house is no mean feat.

“A family might move to safety, but the government will still come with tractors to destroy the remaining houses,” she says.

“We are with 10 other displaced households of different sizes. I live with my sister’s mentally ill sons that I rescued them from the streets.”

The interview is interrupted by a baby’s cry from a dark corner. It is, in fact, Ms Njoki’s grandson who has woken up.

This is the grandson’s new sleeping area. The baby sleeps there with his mother – Ms Njoki’s daughter.

She also remembers applying mosquito repellent to her two small children who have rashes all over their faces.

“This oil was recommended to me by a chemist near here yesterday. He had seen the rashes on my daughter. It cost the family Sh60,” Ms Njoki adds.

“It has been a week and a few days since we moved here. We are yet to see the help the government promised. A Good Samaritan sponsored one of the children here.

""They had come to look for the child’s parents when they found us. The least they could do was include our names on a list for easy access to assistance. Unfortunately, there has been no action since,” she says.

When the adults stay up around fires at night, children sleep in whatever space available.

Daytime when the youngsters are up and playing is when grown-ups put their bodies down to rest, for a few hours at least.

There is no time for hygiene in these makeshift shelters. The families “clean” themselves with dirty water, which is also used for cooking. A small bottle of clean water goes for Sh10.

“The children are not in school because uniforms, books, shoes and other materials were carried by the floodwater. The headteacher has asked them to remain in school until we get the items,” Ms Njoki says.

On May 6, President Ruto said every households affected by floods in Nairobi would receive Sh10,000.

He added that the cash would ease the financial burden of the families and help them recover from the effects of the downpours.

“Proper planning must include providing food, blankets, money and mattresses to the residents. The 40,000 displaced families will be given Sh10,000 each,” President Ruto said.

“A total of 40,000 households were affected during the evacuation. Every family will get Sh10,000 to look for alternative housing.”

Government Spokesman Isaac Mwaura dismissed reports that the victims have been abandoned, stating that disbursement of the money is on.

Mr Mwaura said 9,972 households received the cash promised by the President on May 17 and 18.

“We are targeting 40,000 households and have verified 26,000,” Mr Mwaura told the Saturday Nation by phone, adding that the payments are being made through mobile money.

Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leaders on Wednesday accused the government of failing to fulfil its promise to provide emergency financial assistance to households affected and displaced by flooding in Nairobi.

Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna criticised President William Ruto and the government “for making empty promises while those affected by floods continue to suffer”.

“President William Ruto promised to give Sh10,000 to every family whose house was demolished. That pledge is yet to be fulfilled,” Senator Sifuna said in the city after receiving donations sent to the ODM Disaster Response Unit in Chungwa House.

He added that the government should increase the amount to at least Sh20,000 as Sh10,000 “cannot meet the requirements of the households”.

 ,"The last four weeks have been special for Philip Kipkemoi Bor and his family.

On Thursday, April 25, 2024, Bor, 54, walked out of the Eldoret Prison a free man, escorted by prison wardens and his lawyer.

He had walked behind prison walls, handcuffed, at the age of 18 in 1989, and this had been his home for 35 years, serving in Kamiti, Naivasha, and Eldoret prisons.

Bor had killed his neighbour while suffering from cerebral malaria, and the courts had, on July 7, 1989, found him guilty of the offence of murder committed while mentally unstable.

The late Justice Daniel Aganyanya had found him guilty of killing his neighbour using a blunt object and sent him to Kamiti Maximum Prison, where he would be detained at the pleasure of the President.

His tribulations began on February 26, 1988, in Lessos, Nandi County. According to the prosecution, Bor, who was resting in his bedroom, had accused the deceased of disrupting his sleep by waking him up.

Startled, he woke up and hit him with a blunt object, and he later succumbed to the injuries. This led to his arrest, and eventually, he was imprisoned.

Thirty-five years later, on April 11 this year, he received reprieve through the courts, thanks to the 2010 Constitution and his lawyer Oscar Oduor from the Centre for Legal Support and Inmate Rehabilitation (CELSIR), who put up a spirited fight to get him out of the confines of the prison walls.

Through his lawyer, Mr Bor filed a fresh High Court Criminal Petition last year, convincing Justice Reuben Nyakundi of the High Court in Eldoret that he deserved freedom.

In the petition, which turned out successful, his lawyer challenged the imprisonment of his client, who had been serving indefinitely at the mercy of the presidential power of mercy.

While challenging the sentence, Mr Bor recounted that he was recovering from cerebral malaria for which he had obtained treatment on the fateful day.

Unplanned attack

He recalled he was asleep in his bedroom when a neighbour woke him up, resulting in the unplanned attack.

The lawyer told the court that it was illegal to jail a mentally unfit person. He argued that because of his state of mind at the time of the incident, he couldn't respond adequately to questions from the investigating officers.

It is alleged that during interrogation, he was beaten by investigating officers who accused him of refusing to respond to their questions and had to seek medical attention at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret for injuries sustained. He was arraigned in court for a plea on March 3, 1988.

In 1991, with his father’s assistance, he embarked on the journey to obtain his file at Eldoret and Nakuru Court registries to appeal, but to no avail.

His attempt to petition for release by the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee over the years had failed.

On April 19, Justice Nyakundi issued his release order, but it wasn't until April 22, when Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) released a psychiatrist report confirming that he was mentally fit, that he walked out of the Eldoret Prisons gate a free man on April 25.

His first stop was at a men’s fashion shop in Eldoret Town, where he acquired a new dirty green suit and brand-new brown leather shoes, courtesy of CELSIR.

We caught up with him at his lawyer’s office at Meadows Building, Off Elgeyo Road, where he had gone to thank his lawyer, Oduor, and the entire staff of CELSIR.

He thanked his lawyers for their commitment that enabled him to get freedom.

Mr Bor said the 35 years he spent in jail was an opportunity for him ""to learn the hard way.""

Despite the challenges in prison, he was ready to face the future. He said that he was ""born again"" during his stay there.

“The far that I have reached is because of God and as I start a new journey in life, I will dedicate my life to serve God as his minister to declare His goodness to the world as a living testimony,” said Mr Bor.

His lawyer said the court agreed with his client that the impugned provisions of Section 166 of the CPC breached the doctrine of separation of powers.

Guilty but insane

“The court also agreed that a finding of guilty but insane is ironic as the fact that he is insane would mean that he cannot understand the charge sufficiently to answer it. It follows that putting such a person through a hearing is a breach of his constitutional rights. Furthermore, Mr Bor’s actions in 1988 were not only unintended but also unforeseen,” said Mr Oduor.

In his judgment, Justice Nyakundi ruled that the appropriate reliefs sought in the petition were meritorious to be granted by the court under Article 23 of the Constitution in favour of the petitioner.

“The review of the conviction of guilty but insane be made and the said conviction be replaced with a finding of not guilty for reason of insanity,” he ruled.

Justice Nyakundi noted that the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (POMAC) failed to take advantage of its constitutional mandate to alleviate Mr Bor’s suffering and ordered and set aside his detention.

“Under Section 12 of the Penal Code, an accused person cannot be held criminally responsible for his acts if it is established that he did not know what he was doing or that he was incapable of understanding that he ought not to do the act,” the Judge stated.

In his early days in prison, the court heard that he was severely sick, and prison management referred him to Kenyatta National Hospital, where he received medical attention for one year. He was discharged from the hospital between August and September 1990.

During his imprisonment, he served at Kamiti Prison from 1989 to 2009, Nyeri Main Prison from 2009 to 2010, and Eldoret Main Prison from 2010 to April 25, 2024.

Back at his home in Cheptel village, Kapsoit ward, Kericho County, it was tears of joy as family, relatives, and villagers gathered to welcome him back home. The firstborn in a family of six was in disbelief and could not control the tears that rolled freely down his cheeks.

Did not hide her joy

His mother, Grace Misik, 72, did not hide her joy after receiving her son, who had been in prison since 1988.

“I lack words to express my gratitude to God. I just say thank you, God, thank you, God,” she said.

Despite the long time that her son spent in prison, she revealed that she did not give up praying for him and kept hope alive that what happened to the biblical Paul and Cyrus would one day happen to him.

Her determination and hope in God for her son’s release was demonstrated in her frequent visits to see him in prison.

“We visited him at least three times a year just to show him we valued him as our son,” said Misik.

His brother, Musa Bor, said: “Throughout we have been hopeful that one day Bor will come home and take over his mantle as the eldest child,” an elated Musa said.

“As Kalenjins, one cannot assume the role of an elder brother if the elder brother is alive. I was only acting but now I am relieved since the real head of this family has come back,” he said.

His sister, Alice Cherono, said prayer and fasting were part of the family menu, with the hope of seeing Bor back home.

Similar sentiments were shared by Bor’s neighbours led by Samuel Langat, who described him as a polite man.

“Growing up together, Bor was just a good man. Whatever happened caught us by surprise. That is why we have been hoping that one day he will be a free man just the way it is today,” said Mr Langat.

Back home, Bor plans to marry soon as he settles down and raises a family.

For his reintegration into the community, however, elaborate traditions have had to be conducted in line with the Kalenjin beliefs. The rituals are to cleanse him in line with the Kipsigis customs.

""Before we help him get married, we have to perform some rituals to cleanse him even as we plan to construct him a house,"" his friend Langat said.

His friend has been tasked with finding a wife.

His father had long died by the time of his release, and he had to undergo certain rites before visiting his grave.

Mr Langat explained that the cleansing was to keep away demonic forces associated with the spirit of murder, which resulted in his imprisonment.

“I haven’t given up in life. I hope to marry shortly and continue serving God together with my wife,” an elated Bor told Nation.Africa's team at his home in Kericho on Monday.

To help him reintegrate into society, CELSIR, which facilitated his release from prison by catering for his legal services, conducted a social bonding session to counsel him on some basic social reintegration expectations he would encounter after prison.

They also gave him an exit care package comprising some household stuff and money to start his life with.

“We will be following up with him to ensure that he settles down in the community where he came from and to encourage him to live a law-abiding and self-sustaining life. This is one of the great achievements of our organization,” said CELSIR Founder and Executive Director Anne Munyua, promising that her institution will work with him to ensure that he successfully settles in the community and starts a fresh life after 35 years behind bars.

"Israel's Netanyahu to address US Congress soon, says Speaker Johnson","WASHINGTON, May 23 - Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would soon address a joint meeting of Congress amid heightened tension with President Joe Biden over the Israeli leader's handling of the war in Gaza.

Delivering a keynote speech at the Israeli embassy's annual Independence Day reception, Johnson, the top congressional Republican and a critic of the Democratic president’s Israel policy, said it would be “a strong show of support for the Israeli government in their time of greatest need.”

Such a speech is sure to further anger progressive Democrats critical of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and Biden's support for it. Netanyahu has closely aligned himself with Republicans.

The diplomatic gathering in Washington comes amid strains between Biden and Netanyahu over a US push for Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians in the war against Hamas militants in Gaza.

The embassy gave equal billing to Democratic US Representative Pete Aguilar, who shared the high-profile platform with Johnson at a more subdued event under the shadow of the Gaza war. ""As Americans, we reaffirm our commitment to Israel's sovereignty,"" he said.

Speaking first, Johnson said to applause: ""Tonight I'm happy to announce ... we will soon be hosting Prime Minister Netanyahu at the Capitol for a joint session of Congress.""

Successive US administrations have usually sent a high-level official to the Independence Day receptions.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who in recent months has called the situation in Gaza a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and has urged a ceasefire, delivered last year's keynote, mostly extolling U.S. backing for Israel.

An Israeli official said this year the embassy wanted to honour lawmakers in a bipartisan way in appreciation for congressional approval of billions of dollars in new US military aid.

The reception took place on the same night as a White House state dinner for Kenyan President William Ruto, which the Israeli official said created a scheduling conflict for cabinet members.

Several less senior Biden aides were in attendance, including Derek Chollet, Secretary of State Antony Blinken's counsellor.

The White House declined to comment when asked whether it was consulted about the invitation to Netanyahu or whether Biden, who has denied an Oval Office meeting with the Israeli leader, might see him in Washington.

JOHNSON'S VEILED SWIPE AT BIDEN

Johnson and Aguilar both condemned the International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision this week to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence chief, Yoav Gallant. The prosecutor also asked for warrants to capture Hamas leaders responsible for the deadly Oct. 7 cross-border attack on Israel, which triggered the Gaza war.

Johnson took a veiled swipe at Biden, saying ""some leaders"" have sought to withhold ""vital weapons"" from Israel. Biden has paused one shipment of bombs and warned he could delay others if Netanyahu carries out an all-out ground offensive in the refugee-packed city of Rafah in southern Gaza. But the flow of weapons has mostly continued.

Security was tight around the National Building Museum where the reception was held. A small group of pro-Palestinian protesters shouted ""shame on you"" at guests exiting the event. One person held an Israeli flag stained red to simulate blood. Another on a megaphone accused Israel of war crimes.

On Tuesday, Johnson said he was close to inviting Netanyahu, a right-wing leader who had warm relations with former President Donald Trump.

Johnson, a Trump ally, had issued Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer an ultimatum to sign a letter inviting Netanyahu or else he would only speak to the House of Representatives.

Schumer had signalled he was open to Congress hosting Netanyahu, despite declaring in March that the Israeli leader had “lost his way” and calling for new elections in Israel.

Johnson did not specify a date for Netanyahu's speech.

Addresses to Congress are a rare honour generally reserved for the closest US allies.

Netanyahu has already given three speeches, most recently in 2015. That year, Republican leaders invited him without consulting Democratic then-President Barack Obama, as Netanyahu joined them in an unsuccessful bid to derail Obama's international nuclear deal with Iran.

Dozens of Democrats boycotted Netanyahu's last speech, raising the prospect that some could stay away this time.

Johnson, struggling to keep his fractious Republican House majority intact, has been a prominent voice in the U.S. political divide over Israeli policy. The politicisation of the issue has intensified ahead of the November election in which Biden is running against Trump.

In contrast to past years’ gala celebrations, this year’s reception, marking the 76th anniversary of Israel’s founding, was billed as a “solidarity event.”

Israel is fighting to wipe out Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Palestinian authorities say more than 35,000 people have been killed during Israel's campaign in Gaza.

The big secret: Why I don’t reveal my true income,"In the world of finance, transparency is king. Yet, where family and friends are involved, full disclosure can sometimes breed tension, enmity and unrealistic expectations.

Money, like a capricious spirit, can alter dynamics in the most unexpected ways. For this reason, some individuals keep their earnings tightly under wraps, a personal boundary set not out of deceit, but from the desire to preserve the authenticity of their relationships.

Jatoh Jemimah, 28Data Analyst I can never reveal my actual income. Disclosing such sets high expectations regardless of your financial commitments. People may not understand that your budget is tight and will expect financial help at any time.

From my experience, family members always expect financial support. Most parents assume their children are obliged to give them money. To manage this, I usually quote a lower income than I earn. When asked for an amount I don't wish to part with, I usually say I need to check my finances first, even though I know very well how much money I have.

I had a friend who was always ready to lend money. However, when she began facing financial difficulties, none of those who had benefited from her generosity offered help. This experience taught me to always be cautious about who I assist financially. People often exploit generosity, so I avoid revealing my wealth to prevent being taken advantage of.

My parents don't ask too much about my earnings, they are content with whatever I say I make. They support me through their prayers and only inquire about my financial well-being when necessary. They trust that I will be honest with them and honour my obligations.

My advice to other young professionals is, whenever you’re asked for assistance, offer a non-committal response like, ""I'll try my best."" Promising to send them a specific amount builds expectation. Keeping financial details private helps control expectations and ensures you don’t get overwhelmed by requests or added responsibilities.

Mukumba Edouard, 25Entrepreneur and InvestorI keep my income private because I realised it influences how people perceive me. With parents, I demonstrate self-sufficiency without disclosing any specifics. Among friends, openness varies. Some respect privacy, others do not. I noticed that discussing your finances openly among friends can introduce competition and make others start comparing themselves with you. It is a delicate balance where you need to share just enough and tactfully withhold the nitty gritty. This helps maintain harmony in relationships.

When discussing money, I often tell people that my income levels fluctuate depending on the profits we make. This shows that even I can't predict my exact earnings. It's about being realistic and also preserving personal boundaries. The way we present ourselves influences how others perceive and interact with us.

Managing personal finances can be hard, especially if there are people who rely on you for support. If you're assisting someone financially, they might keep expecting that help with little regard for your budget. For example, if they know you earn Sh100,000 monthly, they may wonder why it is so hard for you to support them with Sh10,000 every month.

In business partnerships, if one partner finds out that the other earns more, it could affect their commitment and contribution to the venture. One has to balance between being generous and maintaining good financial health. I know of a friend who instantly became the breadwinner of his extended family the moment he got a job. They all depended on him for support and this really drained him.

I have set strict financial goals for myself. I make a budget monthly to ensure I take care of my expenses and save, without exceeding Sh40,000. It's not about the amount you earn but the discipline to manage it wisely. Without discipline, you can't attain financial stability and independence.

Phancy Faisha, 24Videographer at CARE KenyaAdulthood has its own challenges, especially when you attain some level of financial independence. My parents have always supported me financially, but now that I earn from temporary NGO contracts, I have learned to keep my finances pirate.

Since I live at home, I am expected to contribute to household expenses. My family believes that because I earn, I am obligated to share my income with them. Thankfully, I have learned to balance between contributing to my family and maintaining my financial independence.

I also know that finances can strain friendships, particularly when expectations around spending arise. For instance, a friend might invite you to a party on a Friday night and expect you to buy drinks or food for everyone.

Failure to do so often leads to misunderstandings. Your friends will label you ‘stingy’ or ‘proud’, especially if they themselves are yet to find jobs. They may feel neglected or say that you've changed. This can significantly affect friendships especially if they don’t understand the boundaries and targets you've set.

When discussing salaries with friends, I prefer not to disclose exact figures. Sharing such information can lead to comparisons and potentially affect the mood and attitude in the group. I choose to keep the specifics of my earnings private to avoid unnecessary tension or jealousy.

Frankincense Wesley, 24Administrative assistant at Kenya Film Classification BoardI once had this conversation with one of my parents. It was exactly a month after I had secured a contract. Requests for money followed and a friend explained that it is called black tax. I don’t have many responsibilities, but I feel burdened with expectations simply because I am a man.

In my opinion, the decision to reveal one's earnings is largely influenced by cultural factors. Revealing such information can make one feel exposed and vulnerable. People may judge your spending habits. Conversely, if you earn well but choose to be frugal, you might face pressure to spend more than you want to. The only time I have disclosed my income was to individuals who I trusted. I shared the details knowing there would be no repercussions, and nothing more would be expected of me.

Some individuals can be quite intrusive and eager to put their noses in your financial matters. Balancing transparency with discretion is key. I am fortunate to have friends who rarely probe, but when financial topics arise, we discuss them in general terms, focusing on ranges or tax brackets rather than exact figures. Although a tax bracket can hint at one's income levels, it still maintains a level of ambiguity due to its broad range.

As a young adult, I am careful not to reveal too much because I don’t want others to scrutinise my spending habits or financial decisions.

I believe there should be a balance that involves withholding some details. I wouldn’t want everyone around me to know exactly how much I earn. So, I usually tell them a quarter of the actual amount to ensure I remain with enough to sustain myself and afford what I want.

This way, I balance the situation, knowing that the amount they will ask for won't put me in a difficult position. I call this amount a ‘hustler fund.' It gives me some breathing room. It might seem like deception, but I'm confident they would understand the need for me to survive, despite their expectations.

Vivian Alusa, 25Businesswoman and ModelI prefer to keep my income levels and sources confidential. Many people are unaware of my profession, and I believe that before one can inquire about my earnings, they should understand what I do. I choose not to disclose where my income comes from because I consider it a personal matter.

Whether I am financially well-off or not, that's a private aspect of my life that doesn't need to be shared with everyone. Revealing one's income often leads to judgment based on financial status, which I prefer to avoid. My take is that financial matters are private and should be treated as such.

I once confided in a close friend about my income, believing she would keep it confidential. However, she felt jealous and inferior because I earned more. I never intended to make her feel that way. Generally, I am open about this with friends and family, but I've learned that money is a sensitive and divisive issue. You have to walk a tight rope between transparency and privacy.

Also, when an individual learns that the next person earns a significant amount but still relies on others for support, it may raise some very difficult questions. Full disclosure is good, but it leaves one vulnerable. I strive to protect my financial information for my own safety and security.

Caleb Mumo, 29English and Literature TeacherPrivacy in financial matters is crucial. If relatives know you earn a substantial income, they may impose expectations or forget you have your own plans and challenges. Keeping some details of your income private keeps a bit of the pressure at bay.

I have also noticed that when some people get to know how much you earn, they may start spreading rumors that you are engaging in illegal or immoral activities. Additionally, if someone with a Bachelor's degree earns more than someone with a Master's, it could lead to disrespect or condescension, which could hurt professional relationships.

Some people are perceived to be selfish, but remember that the amount they can give depends on their financial situation and current needs. For instance, if I apply for a loan and get it, I will definitely not disclose this information because it can lead to unwelcome demands for money, and some may expect much more than I can provide, which may breed conflict and affect my goals and plans.

I don't feel pressured to share my income. Even when I choose to talk about it, I never disclose the exact amount. I always underquote. This way, I avoid setting unrealistic expectations. By being discreet, I allow others to form their own assumptions, thus preserving my financial privacy and autonomy.

Income disclosure is a personal choice, influenced by one's character traits and background. Allowing others to speculate rather than providing exact figures helps one set realistic expectations.

Top Kenyans athletes threaten to boycott Olympics trials,"Against the backdrop of a looming national trials for the Paris Olympic Games boycott by athletes, Athletics Kenya has insisted that the selection process will be held at a World Athletics-certified venue.

Athletes, who sought anonymity, vowed not to attend the trials that are scheduled for June 14 to 15 if they are held at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

Reacting to the athletes’ sentiments, AK President Jack Tuwei said he would not allow the trials to be held at a venue whose track has not been approved by Word Athletics.

Tuwei said he would strive to ensure that all athletes were given the opportunity to try and qualify for the Olympics.

Closed for renovations

Tuwei spoke on Wednesday during the last day of the National Athletics Championships at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

Athletics trials for Paris Olympics Games were initially programmed to take place at the Nyayo National Stadium but the Ministry of Sports has since closed the venue, forcing AK to consider holding the event at Ulinzi Sports Complex whose running track does not meet WA certification.

The Nyayo Stadium and the Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani that are the only venues approved by World Athletics were earmarked by for major overhaul in readiness for the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations.

MISC is in fact closed for renovations while Nyayo Stadium is partially open for athletes to use for training only.

Olympics standards

Nyayo is also one of the venues for this year’s African Nations Championships (Chan) in September. While launching the architectural designs for the venues last year, Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba promised that one of the facilities would be available for the national trials.

“Even though I have attained the Paris Olympics standards I will not attend in solidarity with those who would like to strive and get the standards at the trials,” said one of the athletes who participated in the recent National Championships at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

“These are sentiments shared by all the athletes because they have missed a great opportunity to qualify for Paris Olympics with the National Athletics Championships being held at Ulinzi Sports Complex,"" said the athlete.

One of the country’s top sprinters said that Nyayo Stadium track was fast and offered runners an excellent opportunity to qualify for the Paris Games.

Aggrieved athletes

The athlete singled out the 400m athlete Zablon Ekwam and 400m hurdles athlete Wiseman Were who attained the Paris Olympics qualifying standards during the Kip Keino Classic at Nyayo on April 20.

""We shouldn't allow for another boycott by athletes following what happened before the African Games trials,"" said another middle-distance athlete.

During trials for the African Games, aggrieved athletes staged a sit-in demanding for more spots in the continental affair.

AK had been given 35 slots. Namwamba intervened leading to the slots being increased to 52.

"Shock as missing woman found raped, murdered under neighbour's bed in Embu","Residents are in shock after a woman who had been missing for three days was found raped and brutally murdered in the sprawling village of Riangiri in Embu County.

Surprisingly, the decomposing body of the deceased, identified as Lilian Nkatha, 35, was found hidden under the bed in a neighbour's house.

Nkatha had injuries on her head, neck and left hand, a clear indication that she had been brutally murdered.

A casual labourer who was last seen with the deceased is now the prime suspect in the gruesome murder of the married woman with two children.

The man who owns the house has gone into hiding and detectives are looking for him for questioning.

According to the family and residents, the deceased disappeared around 11am on Sunday when she was last seen alive.

The family said Nkatha was called by the labourer in the neighbourhood and they went together, but the family became suspicious that something was wrong when the deceased did not return home in the evening.

On Monday, the family and residents began a thorough search of the farms and bushes for the deceased, but they did not find her.

Resumed the search

On Tuesday, the family and locals resumed the search and when they did not find the deceased, they reported the matter to the police for investigation.

On Wednesday, however, the family became concerned when they saw flies hovering over the neighbour's house and a foul smell emanating from it.

They reported the matter to the police, after which detectives went to the scene and broke into the house, which was locked from the inside, only to find the deceased lying in a pool of blood under the suspect's bed.

""When we learnt of our daughter's mysterious disappearance, we searched everywhere for her without success and then informed the police and took statements,"" said Rose Makena, Nkatha's sister.

Fell on deaf ears

Ms Makena narrated how their pleas to a local administrator to help them search for the deceased fell on deaf ears.

""When we told the administrator that our daughter was missing and we wanted his help, he ignored us,"" said Ms Makena.

The family said Nkatha called her husband Peter Muriithi, who works in Meru, on the suspect's mobile phone on Sunday morning and they spoke.

Nkatha asked her husband to send her money to buy food and he agreed.

But when Muriithi later called his wife on Monday to find out how she was, he could not reach her because the suspect's phone had been switched off.

Sensing danger, he rushed home and was shocked to find his wife missing and joined residents in the search.

""Sadly, my wife's lifeless body was found in the house where the suspect was staying,"" lamented Mr Muriithi.

The family wants to know the motive behind such a cruel act that has left everyone baffled.

They are also calling on the police to ensure that the suspect is tracked down and brought to book.

Crying for justice

""We are now crying for justice, our daughter's life has been lost and the person responsible should be punished according to the rule of law,' said Mrs Makena.

According to other reports, Nkatha was seen having drinks with the suspect at a local bar before she was reported missing.

Detectives have assured the family and residents that no stone will be left unturned.

""We are appealing to the family and locals to be patient and wait for the conclusion of investigations,"" said one of the detectives, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to brief the media on crime matters.

Detectives said the matter was being treated as a murder and the suspect would be charged with a capital offence once arrested and investigations complete.

They appealed to residents for any information that could help in the swift arrest of the suspect, who is well-known in the area.

Earlier, angry residents tried to demolish the neighbour's house in protest but were stopped by police.

Avril: This is why I have been away from the limelight,"Judith Nyambura, better known as Avril, has been a prominent figure in the music industry for nearly 20 years. She is also an actress best known for her role as Miss B'Have in Shuga: Love, Sex, Money. Formerly signed to Ogopa Deejays, one of Kenya's leading music production and record labels, Avril captivated audiences with singles such as Mama, Kitu Kimoja, Chokoza, and Hakuna Yule. The mother of one studied design at the University of Nairobi but shifted her focus to music during her second year when she recorded her debut single, Mama.

1. When did you discover your acting talent and how did the film industry receive you?I stumbled into acting. So many years ago, producers of Shuga were in Kenya doing auditions and my songs were topping the charts at that time. I approached them and asked if I could have my music in there. MTV's Staying Alive show was a hit at that time, and my dream was to have just one of my songs play on MTV.

I went to the auditions purely to market my music, but as I was auditioning, the producer said there was a musician’s character in the script, and asked if I would like to audition for it. I did and got the role! That marked my entry into acting.

2. You have been absent from the music scene for a while, what have you been up to?I have taken a backseat because of my company (My Everything) and other things that I am focusing on right now.  It is like my small baby. I am nurturing it so I have to give it a lot of attention. My Everything is a company that sells organic cosmetics, which I started a few years ago. I started the company after facing challenges dealing with acne and many other skin conditions. When I started learning about skincare, I got fascinated and decided to explore the field. So far so good.

3. How has motherhood impacted your career? Why don't you post pictures of your child online?My son just turned six and motherhood is a very interesting balancing act. It is not easy. As a mother you are tasked with taking care of life and are responsible for how the child is going to turn out and how they are going to relate with other people. And, there is no manual so you have to learn on the job. My son does not like the limelight and even when you take a photo he will tell you not to post it on social media. I also do not want a conversation after 18 years where my child is asking me why I put his pictures online.

I want that to be his decision. That does not mean he is not on social media, he watches things on YouTube shorts and TikTok and he is living a full life the way he wants. I would love for him to enjoy his childhood like a normal child. If he wants to be in the limelight, I will support him in every way.

4. What achievements are you most proud of? I am surprised by the things I have done in my music career. I have performed as far as Lodwar, Nigeria, and India. I have had such an amazing journey, to be honest. I get emotional thinking about the things I have been able to do, the people I have met, the doors that I have been able to open for myself and other people. Life has been beautiful and I love every bit of it. I chose this path and it has brought so much joy in my life right now and every experience has been so valuable in my life. I want to be remembered as a resilient person. When you are resilient, you know what you want in your life and so you will have the discipline to stay committed.

5. What did you study in school and how do you ensure your brand remains relevant?I have a degree in Product Design from the University of Nairobi. I use it every day in my career as a musician and also for my company. You have to learn how to build your business and how to take your brand to the next level. I thank my parents for educating me because that is the most expensive thing you can ever give your child. I stay relevant by constantly rebranding.

I tell the younger generation to always look at trends, technology and what is happening in the industry they are in. Don't become too comfortable. Always know that there is someone who is looking to get that spot you occupy. If you are not constantly learning and re-learning the industry, you might end up fading. Like right now there is TikTok, do you have the app? We are in the age of AI, are you looking at how you can apply it in your industry? It is always an evolution game and you have to keep on evolving.

Tribulations of experienced teachers employed by TSC as JSS interns,"In 2015, Edna Kamuren from Tenges in Baringo Central left her work as a laboratory technician at Kabarnet Boys High School and enrolled for a Bachelor of Education in Arts at Kisii University.

The motivation behind the decision was to improve her life and that of her three children.

The 40-year-old had earlier graduated with a Diploma from the Eldoret Polytechnic, where she pursued Analytical Chemistry, a course that earned her employment at Kabarnet Boys High School for more than 13 years.

She joined Kisii University, where she studied Kiswahili and Christian Religious Education.

“I was very optimistic that my future would be bright by changing my career, from a laboratory technician to a secondary school tutor, but I didn’t quit my work,” she tells Nation.Africa.

She would report to the school during the day and attend classes in the evening. The salary would go to her school fees, but it was not easy though, she says.

“With all the struggles of work, school, and taking care of my three children, I managed to graduate in 2018,” she says.

Read: TSC to renew contracts for 46,000 interns in January

She continued working as a technician after she applied for jobs at several schools without success until 2022 when the government announced opportunities for junior secondary school teachers, and she gave it a shot. She was elated this would change her life for the better if she got enlisted, she reveals.

Despite applying for employment on permanent and pensionable terms, she received feedback that she had been employed as an intern JSS teacher, which took her aback since some fresh graduates were employed on permanent terms.

She, however, was comforted by the employment letter, which indicated that she would be confirmed after a year.

The year would soon be over, only for the government to fail to honour its promise, meaning she and others in her fate would continue working on internship terms.

She now regrets quitting her well-paying job as a lab technician to pursue teaching.

“The Sh17,000 monthly earnings are inadequate to cater to my needs and my children,"" said Ms Kamuren, who has since withdrawn her three children from a private school for a public school.

Like many other JSS teachers in her shoes, she wonders what criteria were applied to employ recent graduates on Permanent and pensionable terms while denying the experienced teachers the same.

“I am so discouraged because I was looking for ‘greener pasture’ as a secondary school teacher after quitting my job as a lab technician. I had big dreams for my children, and had so much hope in my employer, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), to give me a bright future,” she says.

She had to secure a loan to pay school fees, now deducted from her meagre earnings.

“As a lab technician, I earned more. But I wanted a better future, and I felt I needed to go back to school. I am appealing to the government to just honour its promise and confirm us on permanent employment because we are suffering,” she said.

She reveals that due to the shortage of teachers, some have to teach subjects they never studied in university, implying a workload for the underpaid intern teachers.

Specialised in CRE and Kiswahili

“Though I specialised in CRE and Kiswahili, I teach other subjects that I never studied at the university because of a shortage of teachers. It is very unfair because the workload and roles are shared equally with those on PnP,” she says.

It is the reason intern teachers have been staging protests in the country demanding confirmation on PnP terms.

Joan Toroitich from Karne in Baringo, a mother of two, graduated in 2016 after pursuing a Bachelor of Arts at Mount Kenya University.

She has resorted to doing menial jobs during weekends to make ends meet.

Like Ms Kamuren, she struggled to complete her university education, having come from a humble background.

At some point, she deferred her studies due to school fees challenges. Besides her two children, she has younger siblings looking up to her, all depending on her paltry Sh17,000.

She spends more than Sh250 daily on her bus fare to school, hence her decision to supplement her income through menial work over the weekends.

“Most of those who were employed graduated from the university recently. Why didn’t they consider us who graduated earlier? What criteria was used to employ us as interns because this is very unfair,” she told Nation.Africa.

She, too, points at the understaffing challenge that has presented a heavy workload on JSS teachers, regardless of their employment terms.

“We have two classes, and one has 40 lessons per week, meaning I have eight lessons per day. There is no time to rest, we work from morning to evening,” she states. I am supposed to teach English and Literature, but I have to take other subjects too, which I didn’t study in university because there is a shortage of teachers,” she notes.

“Such a workload and so little pay is very demoralising,” she states.

During protests in Kabarnet Town last week, JSS intern teacher Nicholas Keror took issue with TSC’s argument that the internship programme was meant to equip them with skills and experience.

“What experience do they want us to have when some of us here graduated in 2015 and have been teaching since then in several schools under the Board of Management? We have served as intern teachers for junior secondary for one and half years and we want the government to honour its promise and employ us on permanent terms. You cannot promise us heaven and deliver hell,” he protested.

Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Baringo branch executive secretary Zacharia Nyomboi said JSS intern teachers have gone through challenges, with some unable to cater to their families.

“What type of internship is this, and yet you have given the same job to someone who graduated a year ago? Where is the fairness here?” posed Nyomboi.

Kuppet has asked the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (KUPPET) to investigate TSC and release a report on how many teachers have been employed in the last two years permanently.

He took issue with Members of Parliament for staying silent on the matter.

“They (legislators) are silent yet they are aware that JSS children in public schools are not learning. It is not business as usual unless the government is ready to waste a generation. The government must fund TSC to employ JSS teachers on permanent and pensionable terms,” added Nyomboi.

Mungai's lungs of steel that earn him a decent living,"To say Simon Mungai has lungs of steel would be to exaggerate the power he packs in his chest. However, that might be the best way to illustrate his prowess with an instrument capable of leaving anyone breathless — the trombone.

As illustrated recently in a video that went viral of a policeman passionately playing the brass instrument, operating a trombone is no child's play. But once one gets hooked, Simon says, it is a fun ride.

He is a third-year student of medicine at the University of Nairobi, and learnt to play the instrument at the Safaricom Youth Orchestra. He joined the orchestra in 2014 and graduated in 2020.

Today, Korogocho-born Simon juggles between studying, playing in church, performing, and teaching music. Teaching brings him an income while medicine, in his own words, is “delayed gratification” that will bring an income later.

The trombone instrument must require a lot of energy to play…Yes. You have to eat well, exercise, and do lots of swimming to increase your lung capacity because you have to hold your breath for long periods.

Have you got your own trombone? I read that at some point you were getting one from Ghetto Classics…Yes, I have one trombone currently. It’s called a Holton. It is a privilege to have one because they are quite expensive. They cost about Sh100,000, so getting one is an achievement.

How are your studies going?I am a third-year student at the University of Nairobi. I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree.

That means you are putting in a lot of effort because medicine isn’t easy…I couldn’t say it’s hard. The only problem is that there is humongous content to be retained. But if you’re a bookworm, it becomes quite easy and enjoyable too. You know, it’s like solving puzzles. Sometimes it’s so beautiful. But sometimes it can be, let’s say, too much to handle, especially when you’re also engaged in other extracurricular activities like music and other stuff like teaching. It can be a lot.

By the time you graduate, you will be a qualified trombonist with a degree in medicine, how do you plan to use the two skills? To be honest, I’m planning to practice medicine. I really look forward to being a doctor and furthering my education to a Master’s, and sub-specialise in surgery. But also I’m a passionate musician. When I finished Form Four, I had a hard time choosing between going to medical school or going to music school. But over time, I’ve come to realise these things are doable; they intermarry. You can do one while also pursuing the other. So, I have no intentions of dropping music anytime soon because at least for now, music is paying my bills.

You say music pays your bills…how?I’m lucky to be earning from both teaching and playing music. And I’ve had the privilege to gig with some of Kenya’s finest musicians like McKinley from NHP. Currently, I’m working with Eddie Grey. I’ve worked with Sanaipei (Tande), and I’m also currently playing for Wyre.

Is it the training you got at the Safaricom Youth Orchestra that you are imparting on your learners?Most of my foundation started at SYO (Safaricom Youth Orchestra). I learnt a lot of stuff. Apart from music, I also learnt a lot of leadership skills, because most of the time I was the section leader, and also the principal trombonist. In layman's terms, that means you’re in charge of your section. You have to be a good leader to manage your section, to make sure everybody is up to speed with the music we are playing. So, SYO has really impacted me well, positively with leadership skills, with my playing, with all the knowledge I have.

You’re also a conductor?Yes, I do conduct at Ghetto Classics. I’m an assistant conductor. I usually help our music director, Mr Eric. I also take conducting classes online from The Juilliard School. Juilliard is like the Harvard of music. It is a number one musical school based in New York.

Can a trombone player perform solo or you have to be part of a band?People are used to seeing trombones as a backup instrument, but it can actually be a solo instrument. It blends well with other instruments and it can also take the lead.

Kenyans are used to seeing brass instruments only with police bands and in some churches…You know, it’s a culture thing. Apart from police bands, things like orchestras are viewed as Western ideas. But with time, people have come to accept it as part of our culture. I have seen the emergence of such wonderful orchestras like the Ghetto Classic Orchestra, the Kenya National Youth Orchestra, and the mighty Nairobi Orchestra. The Nairobi Orchestra, for instance, sells out all its concerts, meaning it’s a culture people are starting to adopt. However, we still have lots of myths, like the belief that orchestral music is only for the rich. Yes, the tickets are quite pricey, but the music is so enjoyable. It’s something out of the ordinary…music you haven’t ever heard. And I think it’s so nice. I think with emerging orchestras and concerts every season, slowly by slowly people are coming to adapt to it. I think classical music is here to stay.

As a medicine student and a musician, what does your week look like?I have a pretty ugly timetable. I usually have classes from Monday to Friday, from morning to evening. In the evenings, I sometimes have concerts or practice sessions. On weekends, I do music full-time. In the morning I go to Mukuru to teach music. I then rush from Mukuru to church, and do a quick sound check in preparation for Sunday service. Then I leave church and go to Ghetto Classics, Korogocho, do another session till 4pm and then I go home, and prepare for Sunday. On Sunday, I have to wake up really early, go to church and stay there until 2pm. Thereafter I go to Ghetto Classics, teach and conduct until 5pm, and then I go back home, then the cycle continues.

What does it take to be a good orchestra player and a trombonist?You need to have the passion, and to enrol in a class to learn how to play. You also have to be a daring person because it is a very, very powerful instrument with a very, very brilliant, mellow, wonderful sound. It is not an instrument for many people, because it requires one to blow a lot of air. Some people see it as very heavy. Others think the sound is too loud for them, so to play it well you have to be daring.

Student of business who brought African Esports title home,"How did it feel to be crowned the African Esports champion?It was so amazing to win, especially since the player I fought in the final was someone I had played and lost to online before. In the lead-up to the African Championship, I was practicing a lot since I knew he would be my main challenger.

I really practiced hard and worked on my weaknesses. Beating him to win the tournament was a very big achievement for me. I’m very happy. Part of me did not believe it, but it was reality. It was a happiness I hadn’t felt in a long time. My opponent shook my hands after the match and congratulated me. It felt very nice. After the tournament, we played more matches just for fun.

What does it take to be an African champion?Commitment, and a lot of practice hours. It is not easy. In Africa, it is even more difficult because the online infrastructure is not very developed. We have a lot of issues in Africa such as random blackouts and occasional internet outages, so there are a lot of things that make it challenging to grow in this sport.

You have to fight through all of those hardships. Most of my training is done online because offline, there are not many players locally, so I’m forced to play online players from Southern African countries and from the Middle East. The Middle East has so many talented and experienced players. They also have a proper Esports team, so I play a lot of their players. Luckily, Kenya is located in a good spot geographically to play with opponents from different countries online.

How did you defeat such experienced opponents?I knew about the tournament two months in advance, so I spent the first month practicing hard for it. I had a rough idea of the opponents I would be facing because the African Esports scene is not that big. I know all the top players in the continent. I prepared with my opponents in mind.

I watched videos of them playing so that I could know what to expect in terms of their playing styles because each player plays differently. I prepared a strategy for each of them. On the day of the tournament, I focused only on my matches and my strategies, and it worked!

Let’s go back to where your Esports journey started...It started in 2019. I used to play a game called Call of Duty as well as other single-player games just for fun. Then I stumbled upon a video on YouTube about fighting games, which inspired me. In the clip, there was a very exciting match between Japanese player Daigo Umehara and American player Justin Wong. There were so many spectators who were cheering wildly. I remember wishing I could be part of the game. I was fascinated. After that I began playing Mortal Kombat 11 to sharpen my skills.

What was your first year in Esports like?It wasn’t good at all. I had to buy the basic equipment. Then in 2020 I began taking on Kenyan opponents. I lost many times because they were much more skilled than I was. I also played opponents online from Zambia and South Africa, and lost to them. But with time, I got better. I started winning tournaments online against South African and Zambian players and from there I was hooked.

Roughly, how many hours do you put into training?It depends. If a tournament is coming up, I put more hours into training. For example, before heading to Nigeria, I trained for three to four hours every day. But, normally I don’t put in that many hours because we don’t have tournaments that often. Mostly we have only one major tournament in a year.

Who is your role model in Esports?It is the person who got me into the fighting games – Daigo Umehara. He is the reason I’m playing today. He is still playing and doing well in the sport. I like him because he is a legend in the fighting games. That parry he did against Wong got me into this sport. Outside Esports, I look up to former professional boxer Muhammad Ali and basketball player Michael Jordan. They were so dominant in their disciplines, and I would like to achieve that someday.

Johnathan McKinstry: I’ve no regrets taking Gor job,"Irish coach Johnathan McKinstry is leaving Gor Mahia after a very successful season, opting not to extend his contract but seek a new challenge.

He doesn’t regret taking the job in July 2022 and leading the Kenyan giants to an unprecedented 21st league title despite being discouraged two years ago by other tacticians not to take this well-known hot job.

In a lengthy interview with Gor Mahia Media this week the out-going coach said he will miss the team and will be watching closely how they perform in the CAF Champions League.

But his work in Kenya is not yet finished, he reckons, and hopes to come back one day.

McKinstry will be leaving Gor Mahia after their last league game of the season versus Bidco United on June 23 even though his two-year contract with the club ends in September to take a new job as coach of Gambia. He has bagged two FKF-PL titles with K’Ogalo.

Many challenges

The Football Kenya Federation Premier League winner was officially announced as the new coach of the Gambia on Wednesday in Banjul.

Interestingly, Gambia are in the same 2026 World Cup qualifying Group ""F"" with Kenya. The Gambians play Seychelles and Gabon on June 8 and June 11 respectively.

“I’m leaving this club because I got a better offer,” he revealed

“I was discouraged from taking this job because of the many challenges then but this success makes me not regret my decision,” said McKinstry.

The full interview will be aired on Gor Mahia’s social media site this week.

“I know the club wants someone who will take what we have started growing and build it. We have the fourth youngest squad in the league and whoever comes in should guide and teach these players so that they can perform well in the CAF Champions League,” he added.

“Working with this young team was fantastic and the new coach should be embraced. The team is well set up and the ideas of my successor, I’m optimistic, will help them make another history of qualifying for at least the group stage of the CAF Champions League,” said McKinstry, who formerly Uganda, Rwanda and Sierra Leone.

He said the incoming coach shouldn’t be judged by his performance but should be allowed to bring his system of play to better the club. After the next round of World Cup qualifiers in June, McKinstry will briefly return to Kenya for Gor Mahia’s coronation at Raila Odinga on June 19 when they face FC Talanta.

Bid the club farewell

He will officially bid the club farewell after the close the season against Bidco United at a venue yet to be confirmed.



He never had it easy at Gor Mahia with die-hard fans expressing their dissatisfaction with slim wins he secured and what they claimed was a “lack of clear playing philosophy.”

He said that winning was what mattered and he has delivered the Kenyan title.

But he says what is key to him is winning games because that is what football demands.

Who will take over at K’Ogalo?

Gor Mahia Secretary Sam Ochola said in a statement they will be looking for an internationally accomplished coach with CAF Champions League group stage experienced.

Ochola added that the coach must be new in Kenya, a clear response to rumours that former AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems was being considered for the big seat.

The official added that the coach must also have bagged titles with the national team and club he has worked for.

McKinstry joins a long list of Gor Mahia coaches who have left as reigning league champions.

I really practiced hard and worked on my weaknesses. Beating him to win the tournament was a very big achievement for me. I’m very happy. Part of me did not believe it, but it was reality. It was a happiness I hadn’t felt in a long time. My opponent shook my hands after the match and congratulated me. It felt very nice. After the tournament, we played more matches just for fun.

What does it take to be an African champion?Commitment, and a lot of practice hours. It is not easy. In Africa, it is even more difficult because the online infrastructure is not very developed. We have a lot of issues in Africa such as random blackouts and occasional internet outages, so there are a lot of things that make it challenging to grow in this sport.

You have to fight through all of those hardships. Most of my training is done online because offline, there are not many players locally, so I’m forced to play online players from Southern African countries and from the Middle East. The Middle East has so many talented and experienced players. They also have a proper Esports team, so I play a lot of their players. Luckily, Kenya is located in a good spot geographically to play with opponents from different countries online.

How did you defeat such experienced opponents?I knew about the tournament two months in advance, so I spent the first month practicing hard for it. I had a rough idea of the opponents I would be facing because the African Esports scene is not that big. I know all the top players in the continent. I prepared with my opponents in mind.

I watched videos of them playing so that I could know what to expect in terms of their playing styles because each player plays differently. I prepared a strategy for each of them. On the day of the tournament, I focused only on my matches and my strategies, and it worked!

Let’s go back to where your Esports journey started...It started in 2019. I used to play a game called Call of Duty as well as other single-player games just for fun. Then I stumbled upon a video on YouTube about fighting games, which inspired me. In the clip, there was a very exciting match between Japanese player Daigo Umehara and American player Justin Wong. There were so many spectators who were cheering wildly. I remember wishing I could be part of the game. I was fascinated. After that I began playing Mortal Kombat 11 to sharpen my skills.

What was your first year in Esports like?It wasn’t good at all. I had to buy the basic equipment. Then in 2020 I began taking on Kenyan opponents. I lost many times because they were much more skilled than I was. I also played opponents online from Zambia and South Africa, and lost to them. But with time, I got better. I started winning tournaments online against South African and Zambian players and from there I was hooked.

Roughly, how many hours do you put into training?It depends. If a tournament is coming up, I put more hours into training. For example, before heading to Nigeria, I trained for three to four hours every day. But, normally I don’t put in that many hours because we don’t have tournaments that often. Mostly we have only one major tournament in a year.

Who is your role model in Esports?It is the person who got me into the fighting games – Daigo Umehara. He is the reason I’m playing today. He is still playing and doing well in the sport. I like him because he is a legend in the fighting games. That parry he did against Wong got me into this sport. Outside Esports, I look up to former professional boxer Muhammad Ali and basketball player Michael Jordan. They were so dominant in their disciplines, and I would like to achieve that someday.

Coach Engin Firat: Why we chose Malawi for Harambee Stars’ home ties,"Harambee Stars coach Engin Firat has said the team’s recent impressive performance at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe was what influenced the decision to take Kenya's two upcoming home Group “F” World Cup qualifiers to the Malawian venue.

Stars are scheduled to host Burundi on June 7 before welcoming reigning African champions Côte d’Ivoire on June 11 in the southern African nation.

Football Kenya Federation (FKF) were forced to seek an alternative venue for the World Cup qualifiers, owing to the lack of a stadium that meets Fifa standards in Kenya.

Addressing the press yesterday at Police Sacco Stadium in Nairobi, Firat said they settled on Bingu National Stadium following the Stars' triumph in the Four Nation tournament held at the venue in March.

Kenya hammered Malawi 4-0 before thumping Zimbabwe 3-1 in the final to win the friendly tournament on Match 26.

He added that the team’s familiarity with the facilities in Lilongwe and the hospitality of the Malawians also led to their decision to play the matches in Lilongwe.

Good memories

“We have some positive impact there and good memories about Malawi. We know the stadium and training fields plus the people there were kind to us. They hosted us very well,” said Firat.

He said they did not go for the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania since the Tanzania national team will be hosting their home matches at the facility while Burundi also enjoys a big fan base in that country.

Firat said they did consider the Mandela National Stadium in Uganda since it received late approval to host international matches.

Firat said that while playing their home matches in a foreign country was a big disadvantage, they would strive to register a positive result.

“The reality in the football world is that no team has ever been successful by playing all the time away. You need the home support and the feeling that you are at home. All this is missing for us, making the job more difficult for us but we will try to do our best,” said the Turk.

He warned that Kenyan football will never progress if there are no proper football infrastructures in the country.

Two matches

Firat said that he will travel for the two matches with a maximum of 25 players. The team is expected to jet out of the country on June 2 with foreign-based striker Michael Olunga, midfielder Richard Odada, and defender Daniel Anyembe linking up with their national mates in Malawi.

The Stars coach said that he could miss the services of five players due to injury and passport issues. While defender Joseph Okumu is expected to join the camp today, Firat said he is a serious doubt.



He was also not sure if defender Eric Ouma would be available for the match since he is also injured.

But he said he has a big pool to choose players from.

“When I started, it was very simple for me to name 24 players but now I have a headache to be honest. We have created so many players that I will have problems leaving some players out which was not my intention,” he said.

Gabon, Gambia, and Seychelles are the other teams in Group “F”.

Kenya lie third in the group with one win and one loss. They lost 2-1 to Gabon before routing Seychelles 5-0 in November.

Limuru III conference lacked a real agenda,"‘Limuru Zero’ • The recent “so-called Limuru III conference did not have any real substance for the Mount Kenya region as it lacked a real agenda”, says Joseph Macharia. This, he believes, explains why the Who is Who from the region gave the event a wide berth. “The first two such gatherings achieved a lot and left indelible marks on the politics of the Mountain region.” His contact is [email protected].

Traffic rules • Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen should do more to stop the deaths on the road, says David Kiengo. The minister, adds David, should have traffic rules and regulations enforced. “He should not rely on traffic police, who are easily compromised to let drivers of unroadworthy vehicles pass.” He challenges the CS to go out incognito and witness it first-hand. His contact [email protected].

***

Warmongering • Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga’s rant about a supposed plot against Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua was uncalled for, says Lincoln E. Oyigo. “Leaders should style up. Someone of your calibre shouldn’t be issuing threats such as ‘Kama mbaya, mbaya (It’s an all-out war)’. Let’s promote peace. The 50 million Kenyans need food, not rhetoric.” His contact is [email protected].

Air safety • The aviation school at Nairobi’s busy Wilson Airport should be relocated to a place where there is less air traffic, Joseph Tagaya proposes. “It poses a grave risk to the aviators, staff and passengers.” He hopes the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) will act promptly to minimise the risk of aircraft crashes and enhance safety in this city neighbourhood. His contact is [email protected].

***

‘Isiolo City’ • Nairobi’s crippling problems are because it’s both the political and commercial capital, says David Kilonzo. “Other African countries have separated the two. Burundi has Gitega and Bujumbura, Malawi Lilongwe and Blantyre, Tanzania Dar es Salaam and Dodoma, and Nigeria Lagos and Abuja. Kenya should develop Isiolo as its political or financial capital.” His contact is [email protected].

"Quail, okra, and other ‘pyramid schemes’ and how you can make quick money","A couple of years ago, I visited a relative in the village, where I was served meat I had never eaten before – quail meat. And not just pieces of it, a basin full of whole fried quail.

I was amazed and taken aback at the same time, since at that moment, I had no idea what I had just been served since what I was seeing was too small to be chicken. Understandably, I was nervous.

Fortunately this relative and I are close, so I immediately showed my trepidation and asked her why she was serving us what looked like “small birds”, and whether she was sure they were edible. It is then that she went ahead to explain that what I was looking at was quail.

It turned out that she had joined the quail ‘super business’ bandwagon, but had made the mistake of joining late and had ended up losing close to a million shillings. A row of cages in her backyard was full of the birds, she told me, and since the market was saturated, she had no market to sell to, and could no longer afford to feed the birds, which explained why she had resorted to eating them.

But she wasn’t alone in this predicament, she informed me that one of her frustrated neighbour’s, who had also kept the birds, had opened her cages the previous day and allowed them to fly away.

“We decided to eat ours,” she said.

I searched the words “quail meat”, and the pictures that came up are of plump birds that look like chicken when slaughtered, a far cry from what I was served that day. You see, my relative could not afford to feed hers, so they had wasted away, and were more bones than meat. I could not help empathising with her, as I gamely nibbled the non-existent meat.

This incident came to mind after the conversation about okra water began to gather pace. Suddenly, all the women of Kenya, especially those who had never heard of this vegetable, (or fruit if you asked a scientist) was asking where they could get it so that they could experience its ‘goodness’.

As you can imagine mama mbogas and hawkers have been making a killing, having hiked the usual price of the newest craze in town.

I’d also imagine that there is a Kenyan somewhere that has leased land to plant this vegetable. By the way, Okra is also widely known as lady’s finger, so some of you might have been eating it for years because it is widely available and has always been.

Anyway, this okra water talk reminded me of the pyramid scheme that was the quail business and how hundreds of Kenyans, including my relative, burned their fingers after investing in it long after of the ‘early bloomers’ had made millions and quit the business. Remember the dragon fruit?

The fact is that a big number of Kenyans are always more than willing to jump into the bandwagon, most probably due to the fear of missing out, and herein lies the pathway to richness.

I have realised that if you want to make crazy money in this town, all you have to do is go on social media and extol the values, real or imagined, of a product and ensure that you have lots of it in stock. But not just any product, it has to be one that promises enhanced beauty or enhanced health. Then sit back and watch the money start rolling in.

 ,"It is said that identical twins have a telepathic connection. While this might not be scientifically proven, it is widely acknowledged that identical twins have some kind of special connection that goes beyond what we consider normal senses.

Closer home, cases of identical twins scoring the same, or close to exactly the same, marks in the Kenya Certificate of Primary School (KCPE) or Kenya Certificate of Secondary School Examination (KCSE) examinations is a common occurrence.

Nation Sport spent a day with two sets of twins who share a passion for the same sport, and whose special bond has seen them achieve almost similar success in their respective disciplines.

Caroline Gitonga and Purity Gitonga (athletics)

It is a fairly sunny Friday morning at the Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County, and tens of athletes have turned up for their morning track training session as is the norm at this facility that sits right at the heart of this athletics-rich North Rift region.

As is the tradition, most athletes here train in groups, especially when they belong to the same camp or management.

It is also common to find a group of athletes dressed almost similarly, as they share the same sportswear brands for training and competition.

Amid the bustle of activities, a pair emerges from the northwest corner of the track, negotiating the last 300-metre corner towards the homestretch.

They are at top speed, their strides rhythmical, as they cross the finish line and they stop their watches almost at the same time.

As they approach, one notices their striking resemblance.

Besides their similar training gear - purple top and tights and white running shoes - they look exactly like one other.

These are the Gitonga twins – Caroline Gitonga and Purity Gitonga – aged 28 and based in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County.

They are elite athletes – running for a living – and, just like many other elite athletes, the world-famous high altitude conditions attracted them to Iten.

They compete in the 5,000m, 10,000m and road races, and their common dream is to be the best and follow in the footsteps of former world champions, Hellen Obiri and Vivian Cheruiyot.

Do they compete together in the same race at times?

Yes.

Last year, Purity bagged victory at the Udine Half Marathon in Italy, timing 68 minutes and 58 seconds and finishing ahead of Caroline who clocked 70:13.

“It’s a nice feeling when you are competing with your sister, and this happened last year where we kept pushing the pace until Purity decided to break from me because she was a little bit stronger than me,” says Caroline.

Born in Kiberichia, Meru County, they schooled at Murinya Primary School before joining Murinya High School from where they both graduated in 2014 and went into serious training.

Their interest in athletics started while they were in high school, and they would later join the Run2gether Athletics Camp.

“We changed our training venue from Naivasha because we wanted a high altitude area, and it was a challenge in the first place.

“But we got used to it and we are enjoying our training so far,” explains Caroline, a mother of one.

Purity, who used to run in mountain races, believes training together has improved their performance.

“When we get on to the start line, we always encourage one another and I’m always happy when we finish the race at the podium.

“We have team work and this has really kept us going,” says Purity.

Purity admits that she felt lonely when Caroline went for on a maternity break but she kept training hard before her sister rejoined her.

“I now understand why athletes love Iten and together with my sister, we joined the system and it has really favoured our programme. Our target is to improve each season and be like 5,000m world champions Hellen Obiri and Vivian Cheruiyot,” says Purity.

She adds that while in school, they used to see Cheruiyot competing, and that inspired them to train hard.

They have met their mentor on several occasions and she has motivated them to continue working hard.

“Our mother has also been pushing us to train hard and at times she forgets that we are off-season and wakes us up very early in the morning asking us to go for training.

“That’s our mother for us, but we are glad because our parents have been so supportive,” she adds, also acknowledging their father, Julius Gitonga, for the support.

Their mother, Lucy Nguta, who used to compete in the 400m hurdles, has been pushing them to do better.

She would take them to local races and make sure they register and compete as one way of improving on their performance.

While Purity loves eating chicken and chapati, Caroline on the other hand loves githeri.

Alice Owiti and Maureen Owiti (hockey)

Alice Owiti and Maureen Owiti are 24-years-old and play for Kisumu-based Lakers Hockey Club.

Their striking resemblance has been a challenge to their opponents in the sport.

Alice observes that playing with her twin sister is easy, saying that it took time for their colleagues to understand them as some would think she prefers passing the ball to her sister than other team players.

""I’m a good dribbler, and in hockey, you have to look down at the ball while dribbling before looking up and passing the ball to your teammate.

“But when playing with Maureen, I don't even have look up, because I normally know exactly where she would be.

“She knows my movements and hence, she always creates the best option for me. I mean, who wouldn't know how their twin thinks?"" says Alice with a big smile.

Interestingly, the two have been separated by their professional environment. Alice is a French teacher at the Tenwek Boys High School in Bomet County while Maureen is a volunteer social worker in Vihiga County.

Despite the distance, they meet most of the weekends in Kisumu for their training sessions. This has seen their bond remaining intact.

Alice, who also plays for the national hockey team, narrates how she changed from playing football to hockey and later persuaded her twin sister to join the sport when she joined Form One.

Both went to Sinyolo High School in Nyanza, but Maureen was one year behind. She joined Form One, they both started playing hockey.

“I decided to wait for my sister while in Form Four so that we could seat for the final exams together because we had been separated for a long period. I just had to sacrifice and wait.

""We later joined Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) in Kakamega County where we went on playing hockey for our institution,” says Alice, who is a midfielder.

Alice joined the national team in 2019. She made her debut at the African Games in South Africa and has represented Kenya to date.

In 2017, she was named Most Valuable Player, both nationally and in the East Africa School Games in Rwanda.

She started her teaching career at St Allois Ajola High School in Kisumu County before joining Busy Brains High School in Kakamega County and later Tenwek High School.

This year, she has taken up hockey coaching at Tenwek, steering her school to the regional level competition.

Alice, whose other hobby is watching movies, believes that one day she will play at the Olympic Games.

On her part, Maureen enrolled for a diploma course in social work before working her way through an online undergraduate programme.

But she has elected to wait for Alice so they could graduate together.

“We shared some things but we were separated at an early stage, only to be reunited through sport. They always say sports is a unifying factor, and true to that, we have been meeting almost every weekend to play,” says Maureen, a community mobilizer.

She admits that her sister has always held her hand and is the reason she took up the sport.

“My sister and I are midfielders – though I also play in defence - and this really confuses players from the other teams we meet… we keep encouraging each other because travelling for training, especially for my sister who is far away, isn't an easy thing,” she says.

Maureen attributes her success to Alice whom she describes as her role model.

Through hockey, she has travelled to France, Rwanda, England, Uganda, Egypt, Ghana and South Africa.

She dreams of one day becoming a coach after she retires from active play.

The pair are full of praise for their junior coach, Austine Tuju, who identified them while in high school and later recruited them to the Kisumu club and so far they have been doing well.

“They used to play for our club during the holidays and upon completing school, we continued engaging them to play in the national league and that is where they were spotted to join the national team,” says Tuju.

The coach says the sisters stand out for their energy.

“In the club, I play Maureen in the defense while Alice can play in the midfield and a striker, because she has that ability.

“They have shown good progress and I believe they would go far. Being twins, when they joined the club, it was hard to differentiate them but now I can easily know who is who,” adds the coach.

The club contributed seven players to Kenya’s national team to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022, five to the International Hockey Federation’s World Hockey Fives qualifiers and six to this year’s African Games in Accra.

Rhino Charge: Conservationists aim to raise over Sh173m on Madaraka weekend,"Conservationists are hoping to surpass the Sh173 million raised last year during this year's Rhino Charge to be held in Kajiado County during the Madaraka Day weekend.

Kajiado has been chosen to host the 35th edition of the Rhino Charge.

Nkoteyia Community Conservancy in Ewaso Nyiro landscape in Samburu County hosted the 34th edition of the event, which raised Sh173 million for the completion of the 61km section of the Mt Kenya electric fence in Nyeri County, the construction of the Kakamega Forest electric fence, the maintenance of the 758km Aberdare Mt Kenya, Eburu and Kakamega electric fence, the extension of community patrol teams to south-western Mau, and the construction of the Kakamega Forest electric fence.

The Rhino Charge is not only a world-renowned 4x4 off-road competition, but it is also one of the few sporting events with a national conservation purpose.

It is run to help protect the integrity and ecological functions of Kenya's mountain forests, also known as water towers, as they are the source of all the country's major rivers.

Since its inception in 1989, the Rhino Charge has raised Sh2.1 billion for the conservation of Mt Kenya, the Aberdares, South Western Mau and Mount Eburu in the Mau Forest Complex and Kakamega Forest.

While the first Rhino Charge raised only Sh250,000, the amount has grown tremendously over the years, crossing the Sh180 million mark in 2018 thanks to local and international supporters.

World's longest game fences

Projects funded by Rhino Charge include the construction of the world's longest game fences, such as the 450km Mount Kenya Electric Fence, 300km of which has already been constructed.

The funds have also been used to maintain the completed 400km Aberdare electric fence and the 43.3km electric fence around Mount Eburu, as well as the ongoing fencing of Kakamega Forest in Western Kenya.

Don White, the event's Clerk of Course, has since announced the location of the 2024 Rhino Charge route notes.

The much-anticipated route notes to the actual venue, which will remain secret, will not be released to competing vehicles, sponsors and spectators until a few days before the event.

Rhino Ark executive director, Christian Lambrechts Christian, said the organisation had carried out activities in Mt Kenya, Mau Eburu, Aberdares, South Western Mau and Kakamega Fores in the past year.

Scrutineering for this year's Rhino Charge will take place on May 31 ahead of the event on June 1. The prize-giving ceremony will take place on June 2.

The organisation of the Rhino Charge is supported by in-kind contributions from the private sector including some of Kenya's largest companies such as Total Energies, Safaricom, AutoXpress, Tarpo, White Cap, Castor Vali, Rotor Jet Aviation, Z Boskovic Air Charters, Sandstorm, Mantech Inflight Systems, Aquamist, The Iceman, Tropical Heat, Papyrus, Northscape, Rivercross Tracking Ltd, Instarect, Chloride Exide and Bins.

The Rhino Charge is an annual off-road 4x4 competition that requires participants to visit 13 checkpoints spread over approximately 100km square of rugged terrain within 10 hours, with the sole purpose of raising funds for environmental conservation.

The economic burden of endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain in Kenya,"Every month that 40-year-old Rosemary Mwaniki gets her menses, she spends Sh16,000 on pain relief medicines to treat cramps.

This is money for a doctor's consultation in a Nairobi top hospital; after being rushed to the emergency room, four types of painkillers are given through the vein for quick relief, and more oral medicines to take for two to three days until the muscles in her uterus calm down.

Besides the Sh16,000, she says she had spent close to Sh1 million treating a disease that so many gynaecologists and surgeons missed, endometriosis, an illness in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.

""Do you know why it has been this expensive?"" She asks.

""No doctor ever told me I had endometriosis. They kept treating me for useless things like fibroids, which every woman has, then I end up spending Sh16,000 every month because I'm always in this unexplainable pain. They never take time to think away from certain diagnoses. I had all the signs of endometriosis. They could have asked me this, 'How short is your menstrual cycle? Is there pain in your right leg?' Then they think what else could be the reason for my monthly pain and unexplained infertility,"" she says.

""I once asked a doctor if he goes home and thinks about each patient that he has seen. He sees 50 women a day with different complications, he has his family and his life, what time will he have to wonder what I have and why I am not getting better?""

Rosemary's endometriosis has progressed to Stage 4, a more severe form of this disease, where it has spread to one ovary and right leg.

Sophie Richards (who sought anonymity because she is undergoing another surgery soon) says she has had several surgeries and countless treatments for endometriosis management. The disease has no lasting treatment, so the costs keep piling up as she strives to lead a pain-free life.

Sophie tells the BDLife that she was not aware that she was suffering from endometriosis until it was accidentally discovered during surgery.

“The surgery cost me about Sh550,000, although it was not endometrial surgery. I'm supposed to have another endometrium surgery, but I am afraid to have it done,"" she says.

How it presents

Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows around the organs in the abdomen. The uterus has three layers; the inner lining is the one that's shed every month when a woman menstruates, called endometrium.

In the majority of cases, the experts say that you will find this tissue growing in the pelvic area. Endometriosis can also grow in any other part of the body; they have seen it in the eye and ear as well. Similarly, it can invade different organs, most commonly the large intestine. If this tissue infiltrates the uterine wall, it is adenomyosis; if it infiltrates the ovary, it is endometrioma.

Part of Sophie's monthly bill is the cost of buying hormonal contraceptives to manage her painful menses and the spotting in between her monthly periods.

""Currently, I am taking the pills for 21 days per month until I undergo the surgery on my intestine and uterus, which I guess are all coiled together because of the endometriosis, which is at stage four. My fallopian tubes are also blocked, so I will need surgery to correct all that mess,"" she adds.

Dr Joe Njagi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist specialising in the excision of endometriosis, says endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent condition that progresses when the ovaries have been activated after the start of the menstrual cycle.

""Endometriosis can be detected before the start of menses and the end of menses (menopause). My youngest patient was 15 years old. It can start early and go on until post-menopause. It doesn't necessarily depend on when women start their menstrual cycle to detect it,"" he says.

The cause of endometrium is not known, which is why it may be difficult to manage; it is considered an enigmatic disease. Experts say research has shown that foetuses not yet born have been found with traces of endometrial tissue.

""Because we don't know how it develops, early diagnosis is very important. Then we can manage it and slow it down to a point where it doesn't affect the woman's quality of life and fertility,"" the doctor says.

Is there a relation between endometriosis and fibroids?

""There has not been any established relationship between fibroids and endometriosis. What fibroids have been confused with is adenomyosis [a painful condition in which endometrial tissue exists within and grows into the uterine wall] because fibroids grow on the wall of the uterus. But the symptoms are different,"" Dr Njagi adds.

Symptoms and diagnosis

What symptoms, then, are suggestive of endometriosis?

""Women who have pelvic pains, pain in the lower abdominal region, cyclic pain (dysmenorrhea)—in fact, 80 percent of women who experience very painful menses could be suffering endometriosis, pain during sexual intercourse, pain while passing stool, heavy bleeding, and women who would present with depression and bowel symptoms,"" Dr Njagi says.

The diagnosis should be made by a specialist who has the skills to perform endometriosis imaging. But they are very few in Kenya.

""Unfortunately, we see women who come in too late when the condition is worse; they will have these symptoms for up to 10 years,"" says Dr Njagi.

""The first line of imaging is an ultrasound scan, which is usually transvaginal and gets close to the uterus, and we can look for changes that are suggestive of endometriosis. You will be able to tell if there is endometriosis and the severity of the disease. Another imaging technique is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We can also optimise and do a periscope, which is a minimally invasive procedure where you put a camera in the abdomen which can be used to look around, especially for early disease,"" he adds.

If the scan does not reveal traces of endometriosis, it does not mean the patient is clear of the disease; they could be having the early disease (superficial disease), which is a very tiny growth that can cause severe symptoms.

""It is also true to say the patient's symptoms, mostly pain, are not directly correlated to the severity of the disease. Some have the early disease but have severe pain; others have the advanced disease yet have settled symptoms,"" he says.

However, Dr Njagi adds,""If after diagnosis, there is nothing and you still have the symptoms, we need to rule out any other condition that can cause pelvic pain. Some of the conditions that can cause pain are nerve problems, neuropathic pain and myalgia. We will start the patient on treatment for endometriosis, and if she does not respond to the treatment, we will then conduct laparoscopy.""

How it affects fertility

The scans can be performed during or after your menses.

Does it affect fertility?

""We have cases where women seek treatment not directly because they have symptoms of endometriosis, but because they have been trying to conceive for some time and have not been able to do so until they find out that they have endometriosis. However, you have a chance of conceiving if you have endometriosis. We have to establish the significance of how much fertility has been affected. It's only a matter of when the condition was detected, which will make a significant improvement in the level of natural conception,"" Dr Njagi explains.

Sh5 million treatment

The treatment for endometriosis often involves medicine or surgery. Dr Njagi tells the BDLife that there is no medical cure for endometriosis. For the medical treatment, he says they prescribe painkillers and hormonal treatment, but if the patient does not respond, they opt for an excision.

For instance, Rosemary has had surgeries—not the excision of endometriotic lesions or nodules, but fibroids removal, ovary excision and others, which gave her relief for a year, then the pain came back. Now every month she has to take opioid painkillers and anti-nausea drugs as she mulls doing the excision surgery.

""Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, surgery would cost from Sh400,000 to Sh1.5 million. For the follow-up medical treatment like physiotherapy, the patient might need medical counselling, hormonal suppression medication, and, in the worst case, protective ileostomies, making the entire treatment and surgery cost as much as Sh5 million,"" says Dr Njagi.

The economic burden of endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain in Kenya,"Every month that 40-year-old Rosemary Mwaniki gets her menses, she spends Sh16,000 on pain relief medicines to treat cramps.

This is money for a doctor's consultation in a Nairobi top hospital; after being rushed to the emergency room, four types of painkillers are given through the vein for quick relief, and more oral medicines to take for two to three days until the muscles in her uterus calm down.

Besides the Sh16,000, she says she had spent close to Sh1 million treating a disease that so many gynaecologists and surgeons missed, endometriosis, an illness in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.

""Do you know why it has been this expensive?"" She asks.

""No doctor ever told me I had endometriosis. They kept treating me for useless things like fibroids, which every woman has, then I end up spending Sh16,000 every month because I'm always in this unexplainable pain. They never take time to think away from certain diagnoses. I had all the signs of endometriosis. They could have asked me this, 'How short is your menstrual cycle? Is there pain in your right leg?' Then they think what else could be the reason for my monthly pain and unexplained infertility,"" she says.

""I once asked a doctor if he goes home and thinks about each patient that he has seen. He sees 50 women a day with different complications, he has his family and his life, what time will he have to wonder what I have and why I am not getting better?""

Rosemary's endometriosis has progressed to Stage 4, a more severe form of this disease, where it has spread to one ovary and right leg.

Sophie Richards (who sought anonymity because she is undergoing another surgery soon) says she has had several surgeries and countless treatments for endometriosis management. The disease has no lasting treatment, so the costs keep piling up as she strives to lead a pain-free life.

Sophie tells the BDLife that she was not aware that she was suffering from endometriosis until it was accidentally discovered during surgery.

“The surgery cost me about Sh550,000, although it was not endometrial surgery. I'm supposed to have another endometrium surgery, but I am afraid to have it done,"" she says.

How it presents

Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows around the organs in the abdomen. The uterus has three layers; the inner lining is the one that's shed every month when a woman menstruates, called endometrium.

In the majority of cases, the experts say that you will find this tissue growing in the pelvic area. Endometriosis can also grow in any other part of the body; they have seen it in the eye and ear as well. Similarly, it can invade different organs, most commonly the large intestine. If this tissue infiltrates the uterine wall, it is adenomyosis; if it infiltrates the ovary, it is endometrioma.

Part of Sophie's monthly bill is the cost of buying hormonal contraceptives to manage her painful menses and the spotting in between her monthly periods.

""Currently, I am taking the pills for 21 days per month until I undergo the surgery on my intestine and uterus, which I guess are all coiled together because of the endometriosis, which is at stage four.

Court throws out appeal of sex pest who was jailed for 330 years,"In 2021, David Karega Njau was sentenced to 330 years in prison for defiling five school girls aged between three and six years.

Believing the punishment to be excessive, he decided to appeal.

However, the High Court on May 21 upheld the sentence, deeming it commensurate with the severity of his offenses.

Court documents revealed that Karega would waylay the girls as they returned from school, luring them to his house with money or sweets.

Once there, he gave them alcohol before defiling them in turns. The crimes occurred in Nakuru’s Rigogo village in Rongai Sub-county between September 10 and September 19, 2019.

Karega threatened the girls with death if they disclosed what had happened.

The terrified children initially kept silent. However, one girl confided in her grandmother after the pain became unbearable. The grandmother notified a neighbour, who in turn contacted the police, leading to Karega's arrest.

The girls’ parents discovered the abuse after their children complained of pain while urinating and bathing.

In court, one girl described how Karega hid in a maize plantation, gave them money, and took them to his house.

She said he made them lie on a couch, gave them alcohol, and forced them to drink from a bottle he had urinated in.

He would then cover their mouths to prevent them from screaming and then defiled them one by one. The girl, who lived with her grandmother, disclosed the abuse after enduring two consecutive days of defilement.

Medical examinations by Dr Njoroge Luka confirmed that three of the girls had been defiled, while there were attempts on two others.

In his defence, Karega claimed he was at his grandmother’s burial at the time and alleged that the children’s parents had framed him due to personal grudges and unpaid debts.

Principal Magistrate Rhoda Yator, in her ruling delivered on March2, 2021, found Karega guilty and sentenced him to 100 years imprisonment for each of the three counts of defilement and 10 years for each of the three counts of committing an indecent act with a child.

Karega filed an appeal on March 10 complaining that the punishment was harsh and severe and failed to take into account the age and the circumstances surrounding the offence.

But on May 21, Nakuru High Court judge Samuel Mohochi dismissed Karega’s appeal and found the deterrent punishment commensurate with the magnitude of the offense.

“The appellant subjected the five minors all under the age of seven years to a bizarre and inhuman sexual attack. The orgy of sexual violence and threats of physical harm against the five children resulted in serious permanent trauma scars for which they shall remain, for the rest of their lives. In this case justice can only be served by a deterrent imprisonment term,” Justice Mohochi ruled. The sentences will, however, run concurrently.

Fai Amario estate dispute: 'Son' surfaces following newspaper wife search Ad,"The inheritance battle over the Sh760 million estate of the late controversial Naivasha-based brewer, Fai Amario, has taken a new twist after a man claiming to be his son moved to court seeking to be included as a beneficiary.

Mr Evans Karee, 33, alleges that he is the biological son of the late businessman and has filed an application in court seeking what he believes is his rightful inheritance.

Mr Karee stated that his late father was polygamous and had married his deceased mother, Penninah Shinta, after placing an advertisement in the local dailies searching for a wife.

This development comes just four months after the 14-year succession dispute appeared to be headed for a conclusion.

On January 31, Nakuru High Court judge, Samuel Mohochi, distributed part of the estate worth Sh56 million among 10 beneficiaries and allowed the administrators to confirm the remaining estate based on consent signed by nine beneficiaries.

The 10 beneficiaries included Amario's children Marsha Dee, Miki Ng’ang’a, Bernice Njeri, Debbie Jolly, James Kimani, Sheena Euston, Yuri Gilbert, Sheila Wangari, a minor, and Salome Wanjiku.

Ms Wanjiku, who was a girlfriend to the tycoon, was allocated 5 percent of the Sh56 million.

But Mr Karee is seeking the revocation of the grant of letters of administration issued to Amario's children Dee, Ng'ang’a, and Euston, on September 23, 2010.

He claims these administrators excluded him by deliberately concealing material facts about his existence, and he only discovered the case had been filed later in January.

He presented the court with a newspaper report proving that Amario married Shinta in Nakuru on September 11, 1999. He further alleges that his step-siblings were aware of his existence, but chose to conceal it from the courts when they filed the case in 2010.

“The administrators are aware I exist. They knew my mother. They never informed me of the proceedings and the case was filed in 2010, while I was still in High School,” stated Mr Karee in his court papers.

He now wants the court to stop the distribution of the estate until his application, in which he seeks to be recognised as a family member, is heard and determined.

“The planned distribution of the estate will be prejudicial to me since it will disinherit me from my rightful dues, thus violating my rights,” he said.

Justice Mohochi directed Mr Karee to serve the application within seven days, which should be replied to within 14 days, before giving further directions on July 9.

Fai Amario, a wealthy tycoon who died in 2010, was among the first major suppliers of affordable liquor and founded one of the indigenous alcohol distillers, Fai Amarillo Ltd.

His life was marked by controversy and frequent clashes with authorities.

Popular brands produced by his factory included Amario’s Sherry, Pooler, Medusa, Uhuru 2000, Kata Pingu, Mahewa, and Cantata, which were distributed via depots in Meru, Murang’a, Thika, and Naivasha.

In 2021, Ms Dee informed the court that the company generated Sh28 million every four months.

The estate's distribution has been contentious, with Mr Ng’ang’a and Ms Dee disputing over beneficiaries. While Ng’ang’a wanted all 10 to benefit, Dee sought to exclude Wanjiku and Wangari, arguing they were not rightful beneficiaries.

According to the consent signed in court, Ng’ang’a, Dee, Njeri, Jolly, Kimani, Euston, and Yuri were each allocated 11.85 percent of the estate, the minor 6.05 percent, Wanjiku 5 percent, and Wangari 6 percent.

The family proposed selling the properties located in Mwichiringiri, Naivasha, for Sh56 million.

Fintech start-up redefining digital financial services in Africa,"Huge demand and growth for digital wallets in Africa, especially in Kenya, and with no one building the infrastructure for these wallets so that customers do not have to build them themselves, gave a duo a business idea.

They established Terra Softworks Limited, a fintech start-up that serves to empower African businesses by aggregating financial services, in one platform dubbed Wallet as a Service (WaaS.

Terra was founded in 2012 while the founders were still enrolled at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat). Their goal was to leverage their course-related talents to create solutions for Africa.

“Since its inception, Terra has evolved. We were initially a software development-focused technology company. Throughout East Africa, we developed software solutions for governments, financial institutions and non-profit organisations. Around 2014, we changed our focus to payment platforms and created a payment gateway called SwypePay,” according to co-founder Muriuki.

SwypePay was a payment processing platform that enabled merchants and businesses to make payments and receive payments across East Africa. But this was short-lived as everything went crushing during the Covid-19 pandemic period.

Digital wallets

The founders, Collins Muriuki, 33, and Martin Nyaga, 34, saw an opportunity to apply their in-depth expertise in contactless payments, specifically Tap & Pay, to address an issue and brought Terra 2.0 back to life as Africa’s digital wallet infrastructure.

Terra, is a comprehensive platform for businesses to create and manage digital wallets for their customers easily and empowers African businesses with fast, seamless and all-encompassing digital solutions.

Mr Muriuki says Terra is committed to fostering digital ecosystems across Africa and assisting businesses in thriving on a single, integrated platform.

It is aimed to accelerate growth and realise financial objectives by simplifying and enhancing complex processes. Although he admits that it was not easy.

Mr Muriuki, who also studied Accounting and Finance at Strathmore University, says that he developed a liking for technology from a young age from watching his brother open up, fix and do upgrades on their old computer and he found that fascinating.

He notes that he started the company with an initial capital of Sh20,000 loaned to them by his father. As collateral and a way for them to repay the debt, they sold a Samsung Galaxy Tablet that his co-founder Mr Nyaga had won from a gaming challenge.

“We have impressively grown a 100 per cent boot-strapped company into a profitable African venture, securing significant contracts with impact. Terra is redefining digital financial services in Africa,” he says.



About five nations are supported by the company’s WaaS platform, which has facilitated close to 40 million transactions through the platforms’ infrastructure. This accomplishment is especially notable in the highly competitive tech start-up scene, as obtaining outside money is frequently regarded as essential to expansion.

“We are a B2B business, our clientele ranges from SMEs to well-established businesses that need digital solutions to help streamline their processes and make them more effective. In most cases, our customers, will leverage our wallets to make some complex tasks, simple and efficient, while unlocking growth opportunities in Africa,” says Mr Muriuki.

Terra has had a wide variety of clients; from non-profit organisations, Ed-tech organisations, governments, financial services providers, enterprises among others.

Through the use of wallet-ready smart farmer cards, he led the development of a smart card based tea traceability platform by the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA).

Mobile money

“In addition to giving farmers a sense of security and empowerment, this platform makes sure that tea can be tracked easily from the farm to the factories. It also creates chances for layering and offering digital financial services to all Kenyan tea growers on the same card and wallet infrastructure,” he says.

In their other project, Food4Education School Feeding Programme, Terra co-developed, launched and scaled Tap2Eat, a digital mobile platform that uses cutting-edge Fin-tech to enable public primary school children to access nutritious food for education.

Parents pay for the subsidised lunch using mobile money. The amount is credited to a virtual wallet linked to a smart wrist band which students Tap2Eat in under five seconds. Terra has worked with Cup of Uji for their cashless school feeding programme.

“To give tools and automation with our digital wallets, we collaborate closely with partners in the fields of education, agriculture and healthcare. We have partnerships with businesses worldwide including Motorola, Famoco, Ulefone, Google and more,” he states.

Regarding accreditation, he says that they are presently working to obtain a license from the Central Bank of Kenya to license Terra as a provider of payment services.



WaaS, Mr Muriuki says enables anyone in Africa to create, manage and deploy digital wallets without having to invest time or money in building them. Usage-based pricing begins at $150 (Sh20,000) for startups, and users can take advantage of a 30-day free trial after registering on the company’s website.

25 financial services

Mr Muriuki says the ability of WaaS to aggregate more than 25 financial services, including digital wallets, onto a single platform is what distinguishes it from the competition.

He asserts that their strategy has been multidimensional, firmly anchored in innovation, strategic alliances, consumer insight and persistence despite the competitive landscape.

“Our value offer is around the smooth incorporation of state-of-the-art technology into financial services, with practical applications that cater to the changing requirements of both consumers and businesses. Our platform offers unparalleled customisation,” he states.

By using no-code tools, they streamline complex processes, enabling one to focus on growing their business and achieving their vision in the ever-evolving.

Whether it’s for a small start-up or a large enterprise, Terra’s solution is designed to scale and evolve in alignment with their client’s growth trajectories.

Currently having a team of over 20 full time, remote employees and consultants, Mr Muriuki says that their goal is to see Terra grow into a pan-African company and we go above and beyond to turn this dream and goals into reality.

Biggest hurdle

“The Covid-19 pandemic has been the biggest hurdle we have had to get through. We lost a lot of business during the pandemic and had to close operations in Uganda and Rwanda, as well as majorly reduce our staff to four members,” he says.

By using digital wallets, Mr Muriuki hopes to facilitate financial inclusion throughout Africa. He says their wallets drive impact and that is what they want to accomplish, whether it’s a wallet for school feeding or access to healthcare.

He says by leveraging their digital wallet technology, they have made significant strides in addressing critical societal challenges, such as school feeding programmes, healthcare access, financial inclusion for economic empowerment and environmental impact by promoting cashless transactions.

“To achieve product-market fit for our WaaS service and scale at the regional level beyond Kenya, we aim to create and deploy 1 million wallets by the end of the year, become a licensed Payment Service Provider in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda by mid-next year and to create a positive impact in our society through our digital wallets,” he concludes.

Muriuki was awarded the prestigious 2023 Business Daily’s Top 40 under 40, most promising founders in 2023 by Founders Africa and has been nominated for the FortyUnder40 Africa awards for 2024.

Turkana hit by spike in donkey thefts amid illegal skin trade,"The Turkana County government is moving to register donkeys and regulate their movement as villages are reporting an increase in livestock theft.

Far-flung villages with limited security presence have been identified by donkey owners as targets of the illegal donkey skin trade.

This situation in villages in Loima, Turkana West, Lokichoggio, Turkana Central and Turkana North sub-counties is contributing to the dwindling donkey population, residents say.

The situation has now attracted the attention of authorities who have announced plans to implement new laws aimed at protecting donkeys from abuse and exploitation.

A donkey owner, Emmanuel Kisike claimed that since the establishment of a donkey slaughterhouse in 2017 in Turkana County, there have been increased cases of donkey theft because of their skin and not meat.

“I lost seven donkeys at Lokiriama village in 2018. The thieves just took the skin from three of the animals and left the meat,” Mr Kisike said.

The situation was even widespread in major towns such as Lodwar after some locals were recruited as dealers in return for quick cash, he claimed.

“We fear that the donkeys may become extinct if such illegal dealings are not stopped. Thieves who don’t even rear a single goat brazenly steal and sell donkeys at throwaway prices,” Mr Kisike told Nation.africa,

There is a proposed legislation that will mandate proper identification and registration of donkeys, regulate their movement, and impose heavy penalties on those caught engaging in illegal trade or mistreatment of the animals.

Assistant County Commissioner from Turkana Central Sub County Michael Kiguta stated that the stock theft has caused a significant decline in the donkey population.

“I appeal to the management of the donkey slaughterhouses to resist involvement in underhand deals and ensure that for any donkey they buy legitimately belongs to an owner bearing clearance from the area chief and follow up call made as a proof,” Mr Kiguta said.

The Agency for Cross-Border Pastoralists Development executive director Samson Kimeli says the illegal donkey trade is driven by demand for donkey hides used in Chinese traditional medicines.

Mr Kimeli added that research by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization revealed that the animals face extinction because the existing donkey population cannot sustain the business of the four slaughterhouses.

“We are creating awareness of the need to protect donkey during meetings with donkey owners, authorities, and local leaders. We also support animal health check-ups, treatment, and educational sessions on how to properly care for donkeys,” he said.

Mr Julius Ekalale, a resident said that the current population of donkeys in the county is low due to the beast of burden’s long gestation period of 12 months.

Another farmer Maxmillah Akai said women in remote areas rely on donkeys to fetch water and carry food items from the market.

“We need support from the government to stop commercialisation of the donkey trade as it is negatively affecting our way of life,” Ms Akai said.

Kaptembwa families affected by floods receive aid,"More than 6,000 flood victims in the South Rift are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, Head of Red Cross in the region Felix Maiyo has said.

Mr Maiyo stated that the hardest hit are more than 2,000 people in Baringo County who are also affected by insecurity.

“The rains are subsiding but many of the victims, particularly those in Baringo County who were first displaced by insecurity, are still suffering. I urge well-wishers to come and assist them. Some of the children are yet to report back to school as their school items like books and uniforms, as well as the institutions, were destroyed by floods,” said Mr Maiyo.

He spoke at Kaptembwa slums in Nakuru City where he led his team to distribute foodstuffs donated by the Sarova Woodlands Hotel and Spa and Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge staff to more than 1,500 victims. The informal settlements are home to more than 100,000 residents.

While the assistance did not reach all those in need, Mr Maiyo said that the Red Cross was engaging well-wishers to enable them to offer more help.

“We have been able to get assistance for only 300 families and I thank Sarova Hotels and Resorts Kenya for responding to our call to help the affected families,” said Mr Maiyo.

Support

Cluster General Manager in charge of Sarova Woodlands Hotel and Spa and Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge Duncan Mwangi assured the residents of support.

“Sarova Hotels and Resorts cares for all Kenyans in dire need, including those affected by floods,” said Mr Mwangi.

Nakuru West sub-county assistant county commissioner Sharon Chelagat urged residents whose houses collapsed after the floods not to return to their homes until government geologists complete investigations into the deep fissures near their houses.

The government has deployed senior geologists to Nakuru for more detailed studies after the floods left massive fissures in Kaptembwa area. Most of the houses that collapsed were built near sand quarries.

Confident KDF ready to shine in KVF playoffs,"Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) coach Jackline Baraza has attributed her team's qualification to the Kenya Volleyball Federation National League playoffs to persistence, patience, and hard work.

Baraza, who was appointed KDF coach in 2020, guided the team to fifth place with 10 points from eight as the regular season ended at the Moi International Sports Centre Indoor Gymnasium on Sunday.

The top two teams from the playoffs will book automatic tickets to next year's African Clubs Championship.KDF, who last competed in the playoffs in 2017, will line up for the coveted title against holders KCB Women's Volleyball Team, Kenya Pipeline, Kenya Prisons, and Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI).

Others are Nairobi Prison, Post Bank, and Kenya Army.

Baraza, a former international, said making it to the playoffs after six years of trying was an inspiration to the players who have always put in the work but failed to make the cut.

""I'm super proud of the players who will finally play in the last eight. We are likely to start the campaign against DCI, who have defeated us in our previous encounters, but we will give the match our best shot and see how it pans out,"" said Baraza, 44.

""We will use the play-offs as a build-up for the upcoming African Military Games in Abuja, Nigeria. We want to build a formidable side that will soon challenge for the league title,"" she added.

The expansion of playoff slots from four to eight also saw Kenya Army, Nairobi Prisons, and Post Bank, who made their maiden appearance in the league last season, book their slots for the first time.

Since 2018, KCB, Pipeline, Kenya Prisons, and DCI have been regulars in the playoffs

 ,"Growing up in Nairobi’s Eastlands, Dr Vincent Ogutu would never have dreamt of pursuing education to the highest level in Kenya, let alone abroad.

His parents led a modest life and didn’t own a car, leaving him to pretty much battle his way meritoriously through the journey of books. Now aged 54, his early academic trip took him through St Teresa’s Primary School in Eastleigh, Strathmore School for his ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels and the National Youth Service College in Gilgil before joining the University of Nairobi for his undergraduate studies.

And he didn’t disappoint, working hard all the way up, his resilience rewarded with a PhD in Organisational Management at New Jersey’s Rutgers University in September, 2015, a Fulbright Scholarship beneficiary.

Three years later, he would be appointed Vice Chancellor-designate at Nairobi’s respected Strathmore University after having served as Deputy Vice Chancellor (Planning and Development) and Vice Dean (Executive Talent Development).

He assumed leadership officially as VC on March 30, 2023, taking over the reins from Prof John Odhiambo and becoming only the second Vice Chancellor at the university.

For 10 years, between 1996 and 2006, Dr Ogutu had also served as Deputy Principal at his alma mater, Strathmore School, charged with -- as part of the school’s Academic Council -- all recruitment of teachers and staff, admission of students, finance, budgeting, administration and public relations.

He also holds an MSc in Financial Economics from the University of London and a BA in Economics from the University of Nairobi. But despite his extremely busy, scholarly and administrative schedule as VC, Dr Ogutu has done one thing religiously – run!

Bitten by the running bug, the top scholar has, for the last four years, been organizing the “VC’s Run”, a charity race day featuring runs over 21 kilometres (half marathon), 10 kilometres and five kilometres, all these to raise funds to support scholarship programmes for needy students at the university.

There’s massive learning drawn from spending some time with the VC, sampling both his athletic and academic lives as he prepares for this weekend’s (Saturday, May 25) VC’s Run, the fourth since its inception.

“This (organising the VC’s Run) is personal for me, because I grew up on scholarships. When I went to secondary school, I got an almost full ride as my parents couldn’t afford to get me to Strathmore School…” he explained in his minimalist office at the university’s old wing.

The office is paperless, with a cabinet on the right-side corner and a round conference table for four to the left. A model of an Airbus A350-900 on his desk reminds him of his interactions with the French aircraft manufacturer’s executives.

“If I was to leave, I could be out of this office in just five minutes,” he jokes about his minimalistic work ethic after ushering us into his work station, moments after we were well received by lively and lovely Executive Manager Carol Wakori.

“I know what scholarships did for me, and I’d like to give the opportunity to other people who have a talent and a dream, and so when we do these fund-raising runs, we are doing it for them,” he reflects, matter-of-factly Dr Ogutu and some friends conceptualised the idea of a VC’s Run to raise scholarship funds four years ago.

“We started it during Covid, when I saw a tweet by the Strathmore University Foundation saying ‘if anyone does any exercise run, please log it in and tell your friends to pay for every kilometre,” he recalls.

“So I started running and people started pledging amounts. Some other people said ‘if you run 300 kilometres, I’ll give you 100,000 shillings and I said, game on! Let’s do this! “I remember one day, the Vice Chancellor of Riara University said to me ‘Vincent, whatever distance you run tomorrow, I will pay Sh1,000 per kilometre.’

“I had already run the previous day and was tired, but I thought Sh1,000 was a good deal. So I said let me do at least five kilometres… I ran the five, but then after the fifth kilometre, I realised I was going fast at five minutes per kilometre and in another five minutes I could earn another thousand. Who earns money at that level?

“So I just kept going and after 15 kilometres, I’d reached home and I sent him a message saying:

‘Bwana VC, you owe me Sh15,000. Please send it to the Strathmore University Mpesa account for the scholarships.’

“Then at one point, a millionaire from Europe challenged me and my friends to run an ultra-marathon and said he would give half a million shillings… we did it! And it’s after this that somebody then said, ‘let’s start a VC’s Run’ and that’s how the idea came.” The VC maintains a pretty strict running regime, combining it flawlessly with his academic engagements.

He confesses to having been bitten by the running bug, and is currently winding up his training for Saturday’s VC’s Run at which he will tackle the 21-kilometre half marathon distance.

“I started training eight weeks ago. I did a trial run, sent the results to coach Dedan Miricho and told him ‘This is my baseline, I need you to shave off 15 minutes from this time.’

“He said it would take a lot of work, and he sent an eight-week plan. I run four times a week with different objectives. “Most of the runs are easy runs, especially in the first four weeks and then you start intensifying.

You are doing hill repeats, intervals around the track, tempo runs, steady runs, and today is what is called a fast finish run, a dress rehearsal,” he explained at Karen where we caught up with him for his morning run. Just what drives Dr Ogutu’s passion in running?

“I get a lot of reach-outs, even on email, with people saying ‘I’d like to study at Strathmore, but it’s so expensive and there’s no way my parents can pay.’ “It breaks my heart. “And so when we run and people are inspired by the run and give money for it, then these students can come to class.

“And maybe they are from Turkana, from Kwale, from somewhere in East Africa, DRC Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia… We have students from all over Africa and it’s because of the generosity of people who are inspired by our runs.” And when did the VC start running religiously?

“I started running when I was in high school, not because I was training, but because I come from Eastlands so we walked a lot,” he flashes back. “My parents didn’t have a car and I couldn’t be driven to school, so I’d take a bus or matatu up to a certain point and then walk to school, and walk really fast.

So just because I used to walk fast, I became the cross-country champion without even training, so I knew I had a natural talent for it.

“After I finished school I decided to keep it up and I’d run about 20 minutes every week, on a Sunday, and I’ve been doing that my entire life and then I started getting into races during covid when I realised you can actually run for charity and people will give money.”

And it’s not just running for the VC, but he has also attempted a few ultra-marathon races, runs close to 100 kilometres long.

Not even the rain can break Dr Ogutu’s running resolve. “There’s no such thing as bad weather. There’s soft people,” he observes. What about his diet?

“You need to increase proteins because you are destroying and rebuilding your muscles every time. But what is rebuilt is stronger than what is destroyed and we are just replacing cells with stronger, better ones,” he advises.

“So we go up on proteins – and we have to eat healthy so don’t skip the vegetables, the salads, the fruits, have more of that.

The best is when you know which ones you like – that combination that you like – and then it becomes a lifestyle.

“Then immediately after the run you have to hydrate and within half an hour or one hour, you should eat something and get the energy back. The VC also values quality sleep.

“You need good sleep as well, and when getting close to a run or serious practice session – no alcohol because it takes a long time to clear off your system. Running gives you the discipline to eat well, drink in moderation… it’s just a beautiful way living.” His typical day?

“I typically don’t run in the morning, unlike most runners, because in my case I wake up, take a shower, meditate for half an hour and pray; go for Mass, which is typically the first thing in the morning, and that eliminates my chance of a morning run.

“Then I have breakfast, go to work and then leave early enough for training. So on the days when I have running, I have to leave as early as 4.30pm because most of the training will take one-and-ahalf hours to two hours.

“I sleep for about seven hours, but my target for sleep is sevenand-a-half hours – if I get there I’d be so fresh and efficient if I succeed.” Dr Ogutu has deep respect for Kenya’s distance-running athletes, the role models he looks up to.

“Henry Wanyoike (multiple Paralympic Games medallist) is a blind runner and is always going around giving talks in schools and inspiring Kenyans – Henry is super inspirational and he always runs the VC’s Run with me and encourages me, and I always run the Henry Wanyoike Charity Run. “Then of course the G.O.A.T.

“He’s a reader, which is something very difficult to get in Kenya these days. The fact that he reads books and he thinks is just amazing! “Then of course his lifestyle, his dedication to his family, his discipline… you don’t hear any scandals, or any funny things that he did… “Then his simplicity, mingling with everyone, eating his ugali, sleeping in those bunks. He is basically almost like one of these monks.

Very inspirational!

“A shout out to Eliud! He’s very inspirational to us runners and to the younger generation on how people should live their lives and breaking barriers.” Dr Ogutu sees sport as a metaphor for life.

“That’s why it’s so exciting when we watch sports because it mirrors the struggles we have in life… seeing someone set an ambitious target and getting it or almost getting it is a metaphor of how our lives are.

“The discipline in everything you learn in life will be mirrored in life” During our Karen interview, Dr Ogutu is accompanied by his day’s training partner, Strathmore University graduate Tuzo Kithinji Munene.

“Tuzo here ran 100 kilometres in honour of his (late) dad. He lives such an inspirational life for a young man who just graduated a year ago. Even these younger people inspire me,” the VC pays tribute to his young protégé.

What sort of impact would he like the VC’s Run to have and to be remembered for?

“One, I’d like it to be remembered for the cause we are running for, that we are putting people in class who would otherwise be in the slums in a remote part of Kenya of Africa, unable to access such a good education as a Strathmore Education.

“Second is promoting running as a lifestyle and making it enjoyable because we set different targets. There are those running the 21km and want to do it at a certain pace and overcome some barrier.

There are some doing the same for the 10km and others for the 5km. Some are thinking of it as a walk, some come for the bouncing castles and the music, Zumba and having a day out with family and friends.

“We want people to have fun in a healthy way and we see less and less of that in society… we’d rather promote a lifestyle having incredible fun and promoting a nice, healthy lifestyle,” he concludes.

Registration for the VC’s Run is ongoing at the university and online at: https://vcrun.strathmore.edu

 ,"Moses Kagochi is a typical reflection of the Biblical saying – in the Book of Luke Chapter 4 verse 24 - that a prophet is not accepted in his hometown.

Kagochi, former Kenya international hockey star who played his club game for Daystar University and Kenyatta University, was also once the national men’s hockey team assistant coach.

But after years of trying to get Kenya’s top coaching job, the 49-year-old Kagochi took flight to Europe.

And he has no regrets as he currently is the technical manager at the Hockey Club Delta Venlo which competes in the Royal Dutch Hockey Association (Koninklijke Nederlands Hockey Bond, or KNHB) leagues.

Kagochi designs and oversees trainers’ and coaches’ training programmes of the Venlo men’s and women's senior teams, the juniors (under-18 years to under-14 years) as well as youngest youth (under-12 years and under-16 years

The Venlo clubs play in the second tier (Jupiler) league.

But why did Kagochi, who boasts a respected International Hockey Federation (FIH) High Performance Level Four coaching certificate, move to the Netherlands?

And why did he pick Delta Venlo?

“I enrolled for the Level Four coaching course in the Netherlands in 2018,”

“It was while there that I met coach Sigfried Aikman from the Netherlands, with whom we had undergone a development course in Ghana in 2016.

“He helped me network and his instructors and coaches in attendance fell in love with my personality and my communication skills.

“They wanted to know me better, considering I was black and had a lot of ideas on hockey despite coming from a developing country,"" recollected Kagochi during the interview at Nation Centre recently.

“In 2017, Aikman invited me back to the Netherlands where he attached me to Amersfoort Hockey Club for three months. Luckily, during that period, the FIH offered me a scholarship to attend an Intercontinental High Performance course in Amsterdam.

“While there, I met Venlo Club president Jeroen Bakkers. That would be my turning point.

“Bakkers invited me for three months every other season just to show me how things are done in the Netherlands.

“Little did I know my contribution to the club was being noticed.

“I wanted to be an information-based coach. I had a vision for the sport but I never thought it would be actualised here.

“Since there was goodwill between me and the officials from the Netherlands, I embarked on ways that I would move there and launch my professional coaching career,” he added.

The Netherlands is one of the most successful hockey nations in the world having won the Summer Olympic Games twice (Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000), the World Cup three times (1973, 1990 and 1998) and the Hockey World League once (in the 2012/13 season).

The Netherlands occupies the top position in the International Hockey Federation’s men’s (followed by Belgium and Australia) and women's (followed by Argentina and Germany) rankings.

In stark contrast, Kenya doesn’t feature in the top 20 in the men’s or women’s standings with South Africa (18th) the best placed African nation in the women’s rankings and also in the men’s rankings (14th).

Growing up in Ngara, Nairobi, and while studying at St Peter’s Cleavers Primary School, Kagochi fell in love with hockey.

“The hockey stick was a compulsory requirement when joining Jamhuri High School.

“And so my mother (Josephine Wanjiku) got me the stick. I remember two teams (Karate Axiom men’s team and Inter-Capitale women’s team) used to train at the school’s facilities.

“After classes, I would walk to the fields just to have a look of how the sport was played. I grew fond of the game and within no time, I formed part of the school team.

“Although we didn't win titles, we reached the national school games finals  where we were runners up in 1992 and 1993,” says the father of three (Jesse, Jadyn and Joelle)

Jesse, a striker, played hockey at Upper Hill School before turning up for Kenyatta University while Jadyn, a defender, is a Matuga Girls High School alumna.

Kagochi would automatically become a hockey enthusiast after finishing his high school education at Jamhuri High School in 1993.

“I played for Kenya Breweries, which was a force to reckon with, although, in 1995, Breweries was

disbanded and some players formed Wazalendo Hockey Club, while others joined to Park Road Hockey Club.

“I played for Karate Axiom from 1995 to 2008 and then  I decided to venture into coaching.

“As player, I didn't get the best guidance and knowledge from the tacticians then, and I thought taking up the coaching course would help me better the upcoming players by sharing the knowledge I didn't get at the time,” said Kagochi, who worked as Country Manager Representative at Sameer Africa from 2001 before he moved to Malawi in 2007-2010 as the sales representative for Sameer Africa.

Kagochi says the move to Malawi was the eye opener.

Although he interacted with people from all walks of life, he says his decision to go for a coaching course (Level One) in Malawi set him up for coaching opportunities back home.

“I had stopped playing hockey, but the passion and determination to help the upcoming players be better at what they did pushed me into coaching.

“It’s in Malawi that I met Allistar “Ally” Fredricks from South Africa who later became my mentor, encouraging me to enroll for more coaching courses and until his death in 2021, I had a FIH High Performance Level Four certificate. I owe this achievement to him,” said Kagochi, who was the Kenya men's hockey team assistant coach working under Meshack Senge during the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa and World League One in Accra, Ghana.

Kenya’s men's team finished third in Johannesburg and runners up in the Accra show.

Fredricks was the first player of colour to play for the South African national hockey team during the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, a legend of the game who brought hope to many.

After Kagochi resigned from Sameer Africa in 2010, Daystar University were shopping for a coach and he jumped onto the offer.

He later joined Kenyatta University in 2015 before he left for the Netherlands in 2021.

“Although my stay at KU was more successful than at Daystar, I'm happy I left good structures at both universities, but I wanted to be information based -coach, armed with principles, culture and values,” he explained.

Among his coaching accolades, Kagochi led Kenyatta University’s men’s and women's teams to win the East African University Games titles in 2016 before clinching the Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) national titles the following year.

""In between 2016 and 2021, I was being invited to the Netherlands for three-month sessions, just to learn and see how teams performed at high level.

“I requested the FIH to link me up with a dutch club and the international body wrote a letter requesting Venlo Delta if I could be attached to their club.

“Oliver Kurtz, the chairman Venlo Club, agreed and the club has become a home since 2021.

“I have learnt a lot since I moved to Netherlands and I hope some day I will get chance to share with people back home. Kenya has talent but they lack technicalities, governance and vision,” revealed Kagochi in no-holds-barred fashion.

He has renewed his one-year contract with the Dutch club with more responsibilities that include mentoring and educating coaches as well as coming up with club policy.

Kagochi say Venlo Delta hierarchy wanted a neutral coach considering three clubs from the Venlo City had been disbanded to form one team.

He was better placed to get the job.

Venlor, Bletick and Teglen, all from Venlo City, participated in the League, but the stakeholders of the three teams decided to merge to form one team in 2020 for the betterment and growth of the sport, but more so for the city to be more competitive.

""The club's hierarchy than decided to get a neutral coach. Remember these were three clubs which had their own ways of doing things and now that they had been merged, it was only fair they get a neutral manager who had no links with clubs.

“It would have been difficult to chose one manager from the three clubs to steer the club and that's how I got the nod from the President Bakkers,” recalls Kagochi.

From coach, technical co-ordinator and now technical manager, Kagochi is extending an olive branch to the Kenya Hockey Union to consider his interest, qualification and experience.

“I'm always ready and willing to work with the union for the common goal which is to promote and help the sport to grow and return back to the golden days.

“I would love to share the knowledge that I have acquired in the Netherlands which is a powerhouse in sport.

“I also intend to get local players to come to the Netherlands for trials and if they impress then, who knows, they might be picked for professional stints,” concluded Kagochi.

The Netherlands occupies the top position in the International Hockey Federation’s men’s (followed by Belgium and Australia) and women's (followed by Argentina and Germany) rankings.

In stark contrast, Kenya doesn’t feature in the top 20 in the men’s or women’s standings with South Africa (18th) the best placed African nation in the women’s rankings and also in the men’s rankings (14th).

Growing up in Ngara, Nairobi, and while studying at St Peter’s Cleavers Primary School, Kagochi fell in love with hockey.

“The hockey stick was a compulsory requirement when joining Jamhuri High School.

“And so my mother (Josephine Wanjiku) got me the stick. I remember two teams (Karate Axiom men’s team and Inter-Capitale women’s team) used to train at the school’s facilities.

“After classes, I would walk to the fields just to have a look of how the sport was played. I grew fond of the game and within no time, I formed part of the school team.

“Although we didn't win titles, we reached the national school games finals  where we were runners up in 1992 and 1993,” says the father of three (Jesse, Jadyn and Joelle)

Jesse, a striker, played hockey at Upper Hill School before turning up for Kenyatta University while Jadyn, a defender, is a Matuga Girls High School alumna.

Kagochi would automatically become a hockey enthusiast after finishing his high school education at Jamhuri High School in 1993.

“I played for Kenya Breweries, which was a force to reckon with, although, in 1995, Breweries was

disbanded and some players formed Wazalendo Hockey Club, while others joined to Park Road Hockey Club.

“I played for Karate Axiom from 1995 to 2008 and then  I decided to venture into coaching.

“As player, I didn't get the best guidance and knowledge from the tacticians then, and I thought taking up the coaching course would help me better the upcoming players by sharing the knowledge I didn't get at the time,” said Kagochi, who worked as Country Manager Representative at Sameer Africa from 2001 before he moved to Malawi in 2007-2010 as the sales representative for Sameer Africa.

Kagochi says the move to Malawi was the eye opener.

Although he interacted with people from all walks of life, he says his decision to go for a coaching course (Level One) in Malawi set him up for coaching opportunities back home.

“I had stopped playing hockey, but the passion and determination to help the upcoming players be better at what they did pushed me into coaching.

“It’s in Malawi that I met Allistar “Ally” Fredricks from South Africa who later became my mentor, encouraging me to enroll for more coaching courses and until his death in 2021, I had a FIH High Performance Level Four certificate. I owe this achievement to him,” said Kagochi, who was the Kenya men's hockey team assistant coach working under Meshack Senge during the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa and World League One in Accra, Ghana.

Kenya’s men's team finished third in Johannesburg and runners up in the Accra show.

Fredricks was the first player of colour to play for the South African national hockey team during the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, a legend of the game who brought hope to many.

After Kagochi resigned from Sameer Africa in 2010, Daystar University were shopping for a coach and he jumped onto the offer.

He later joined Kenyatta University in 2015 before he left for the Netherlands in 2021.

“Although my stay at KU was more successful than at Daystar, I'm happy I left good structures at both universities, but I wanted to be information based -coach, armed with principles, culture and values,” he explained.

Among his coaching accolades, Kagochi led Kenyatta University’s men’s and women's teams to win the East African University Games titles in 2016 before clinching the Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) national titles the following year.

""In between 2016 and 2021, I was being invited to the Netherlands for three-month sessions, just to learn and see how teams performed at high level.

“I requested the FIH to link me up with a dutch club and the international body wrote a letter requesting Venlo Delta if I could be attached to their club.

“Oliver Kurtz, the chairman Venlo Club, agreed and the club has become a home since 2021.

“I have learnt a lot since I moved to Netherlands and I hope some day I will get chance to share with people back home. Kenya has talent but they lack technicalities, governance and vision,” revealed Kagochi in no-holds-barred fashion.

He has renewed his one-year contract with the Dutch club with more responsibilities that include mentoring and educating coaches as well as coming up with club policy.

Kagochi say Venlo Delta hierarchy wanted a neutral coach considering three clubs from the Venlo City had been disbanded to form one team.

He was better placed to get the job.

Venlor, Bletick and Teglen, all from Venlo City, participated in the League, but the stakeholders of the three teams decided to merge to form one team in 2020 for the betterment and growth of the sport, but more so for the city to be more competitive.

""The club's hierarchy than decided to get a neutral coach. Remember these were three clubs which had their own ways of doing things and now that they had been merged, it was only fair they get a neutral manager who had no links with clubs.

“It would have been difficult to chose one manager from the three clubs to steer the club and that's how I got the nod from the President Bakkers,” recalls Kagochi.

From coach, technical co-ordinator and now technical manager, Kagochi is extending an olive branch to the Kenya Hockey Union to consider his interest, qualification and experience.

“I'm always ready and willing to work with the union for the common goal which is to promote and help the sport to grow and return back to the golden days.

“I would love to share the knowledge that I have acquired in the Netherlands which is a powerhouse in sport.

“I also intend to get local players to come to the Netherlands for trials and if they impress then, who knows, they might be picked for professional stints,” concluded Kagochi.

Okutoyi’s Olympics dream hangs in the balance,"African Games women's tennis champion, Angella Okutoyi, remains optimistic about her chances of qualifying for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

The 20-year-old needs to break into the Top 400 by June 10, but the fight for crucial points has not gone quite well.

The USA-based player was working on getting between 70 and 100 points after moving one step closer to the Summer Games by winning the 2023 African Games in Accra, Ghana in March this year, but has managed 18 so far.

She collected two points from reaching the second round of the qualifying draw at W75 Charlottesville and eight each from W35 Boca Raton and W35 Bethany Beach main draw quarter-final stage.

The three events were held on her favourite surface clay.

Okutoyi is ranked 523 with 101 points in the WTA singles rankings, and is left with two make-or-break tournaments in Tunisia - W35 La Marsa (May 27 to June 2) and W50 La Marsa (June 3-9).

“I still have three weeks, so anything could change. I’m going to give all I have and whatever happens. I leave it to God,” the 2022 Wimbledon Doubles junior champion told Nation Sport on phone on Sunday.

To realize her dream of competing at the Paris 2024 Olympics, the 20-year-old has no room for slip-ups in the La Marsa tournaments where there is a high possibility that she will start in the qualifying draw.

In her latest outing, Okutoyi, who won gold in singles and silver in doubles at the African Games, lost 6-2, 6-1 against Swede Kajsa Rinaldo in the quarter-finals of the Sea Colony Tennis in Delaware on Friday.

She was also eliminated in doubles in the quarter-final stage after losing 6-3, 4-6, 10-4 alongside Ukrainian partner Anita Sahdiieva, at the hands of American pair Ashton Bowers and Mia Yamakita.

Suffering retirees deserve accessing their pension contribution without delay,"Pensioners are happy to hear that savings of up to Sh30,000 per month in retirement benefit schemes could soon be tax-exempt should Parliament pass a Bill that seeks to raise the figure from the current Sh20,000. Many of us have received nothing as a pension as some die from sickness, hardships and poverty despite having worked hard all those years.

The proposed law would motivate people to save more for retirement, which will also lower their tax liability. The proposed 50 per cent increase in the figure is contained in the Finance Bill, 2024, which seeks to amend Section 5 of the Income Tax Act that allows Kenya Revenue Authority to exempt from tax up to Sh240,000 annual income contributed as pension.

Pensioners now hope for the prompt passing of the Bill in Parliament and the President’s assent. Retirees hope to get tax-free pension and without delay.

Kimani Meja Njuguna, Kiambu

* * *

As a pensioner, I smiled as I read your editorial, “Save retirees from agony” (Daily Nation, May 16). I agree with you that pensioners have not been treated well. Pensioners have remained at the mercy of their former employers, who see nothing good in them.

This has seen many of them die early due to hopelessness. The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2024 seeks to amend the Pensions Act, Cap 189, to include an automatic cost of living adjustment to the pensions earned by all retired public servants.

As you rightly suggested, private sector retirees should be included; all retirees spent their best years building the nation. Some private sector retirees get some semblance of COLA. But it is not guaranteed because it’s given at the discretion of the trustees, such that many years pass before one is mercifully granted.

It should be automatic and not left at the whims of a few unwilling trustees, who can easily be compromised and deny the pensioners their due.

Young farmer puts smile on dairy and poultry keepers,"Peter Ng’ang’a is a man on a mission. He wants the best for dairy and poultry farmers in Nembu village, Gatundu South constituency, Kiambu County. Ng’ang’a’s quest began after his first poultry project failed. More than half the chicks he had started with died as he had little knowledge on feed.

“My background is humble. I started with about 100 chicks, but was left with just 40 after a few days,” he says.

The agribusiness started soon after Ng’ang’a had completed his secondary school education and enrolled for a six-month course on animal feed formulation at the Dairy Training Institute, Naivasha.

Ng’ang’a did not want to repeat the same mistakes he made on feeding his chicks.

After the training, Ng’ang’a founded an organisation called Farmer’s Smile Africa.

“Getting high quality feed and information was a big challenge. I also had problems with delivering products on time. That is why I came up with the idea of creating the brand. We wanted to provide quality products, information and services to farmers then make follow-ups,” he says.

Farmer’s Smile Africa boasts of 70 members that Ng’ang’a trains, mentors and involves in demonstrations. The members are dairy and poultry farmers.

“I help address problems farmers encounter by providing information. The organisation also works with experts. When, for instance, a farmer needs information on horticulture, I refer him or her to the appropriate experts,” he says.

mencken indent: Ng’ang’a also owns a shop that sells feed for cows, pigs and poultry. He has invested in technology that mixes the raw materials after formulating. A tonne of feed for dairy cows is made in 40 minutes only.

Farmer’s Smile Africa also links livestock owners with insurance companies.

“The animals are insured against death, diseases and accidents,” Ng’ang’a says.

Farmers in Nembu have formed groups with the purpose of sharing knowledge.

Isabel Wairimu, a dairy farmer and a member of Farmer’s Smile Africa, is the chairperson of Gathage Mwanzo Mpya Group.

“Before being trained on proper feeding, I used to call an animal health service provider regularly to give them injections. That has changed. The health of my cows has improved and their skins are smooth,” the 56-year-old says.

“The quantity of milk has more than doubled. One of my cows used to produced just five litres of milk a day. The amount has risen to 11. The younger one produces about 20 litres.”

Wairimu sells her milk to cooperative societies and individuals. She monitors her cows from birth. The farmer says the quality and quantity of milk production is determined by the age of the animal. Wairimu’s poultry project is also thriving.

“Many people come to buy eggs for hatching. It makes me happy for it shows that I’m helping other households start or improve their farming. I also grow Napier grass, bananas, avocados and other crops,” she says.

Antonio Innocent Mudong’i, an animal nutritionist, compares a dairy cow to a baby, saying production can be expensive.

“When you chop and press Napier grass, water will come out. Farmers need to note that about 80 per cent of the grass is water,” he says.

“The animal will naturally be tempted to eat such grass. The farmer should ensure the grass dries and then chop it. Give the animal three kilogrammes of the dry matter.”

Mudong’i advises farmers to harvest hay when flowering as that is the time nutrients are most concentrated. There is also a good protein level in the grass.

“Lack of knowledge by farmers leads to poor feeding. Because of that, the animal gets diarrhoeal and other opportunistic diseases,” he says.

The illnesses are also as a result of feed that is full of aflatoxin. Do not preserve the feed in an area full of moisture.”

"Agony of nightclubs, churches in city estates","“We can’t sleep because of the noise. They come, party, and then leave in the morning to go to their quiet neighbourhoods,” says Obadae Mwaura, a resident of Mirema Drive in Nairobi. For five years now, Mr Mwaura, a pastor, has been among the hundreds of residents of Mirema Drive in Nairobi who have had to endure the ear-shattering noises, causing them sleepless nights, and the increasingly skimpily dressed revellers ‘behaving badly’, causing them shame.

When Mr Mwaura moved in more than two decades, he says, Mirema was “safe and habitable.” But everything changed five years ago when the first nightclub opened its doors. Then the second. The third. And more sprouted.

“Within a year, the clubs had reigned supreme in our once quiet estate,” he says.

A once relatively tranquil estate tucked less than a kilometre from the busy Thika Superhighway and a stone’s throw away from TRM Mall, it was a relatively prestigious address with bungalows and maisonettes dotting the area. But slowly, it has turned into a concrete jungle of high-rise apartment blocks, shops, churches, and nightclubs.

Read: Three Mirema clubs, Church fined Sh5m for noise pollution, ordered closed

One section of the road is fully lined with liquor stores. By 7 pm, nightlife kicks in, ushered by young women in tiny dresses walking into the clubs. Njuguna Mbigi, the chair of the Amani Residents Association/Mirema, says they are exhausted by the constant noise pollution from the clubs. “Everybody comes home tired, hoping to rest, but you wake up tired in the morning to go to work after spending the night annoyed at the noise, tossing and turning,” he says.

The residents moved to court, suing over “noise pollution and public nuisance.”

In a landmark ruling that is likely to set a precedent in the tale of pubs and churches in residential areas, delivered earlier this month, the Environmental and Land Court (ELC) ordered the closure of three clubs and a church in Mirema Drive and fined them Sh5 million over noise pollution. “This judgment, I believe, is going to bring soberness,” says Mr Mwaura.

However, when Lifestyle spent the better part of the day in the area, talking to residents and observing whether the four had complied with the court order to close, we found them still operational. “The impression we get is that they are not inclined to respect either the law or the court order,” says Mr Mbigi.

He is particularly disheartened by the continued operation of Trinity House International Church and three nightclubs: La Tessara Lounge, Cocorico, and Paris Lounge Mirema.

Soundproof homes

Mr Mwaura said some residents have had to find ways to shield themselves from the noise, which feels like their bedrooms or living rooms sit next a stack of speakers.

“My neighbours, especially those very near these places, have had to soundproof their homes because the noise is unbearable,” he tells Lifestyle. Another annoyance is the traffic jams and crowded streets. “When we moved here, we would jog and ride bikes along Mirema Drive, but now you can’t.

For instance, on Friday nights, it can take you even an hour to drive 800 metres to your house because of the heavy traffic,” he says. There are hundreds of cars locked in a seemingly endless tussle for space to move or to park; people hooting for hours on end; and the gridlocks last for hours as cars take detours into various nightspots. The boom-boom of the discordant music, rhumba here, Gengetone there, leave one with a noise-induced headache.

“Paris Lounge [one of the clubs in the area] has at least 17 speakers, which I counted,” says Mr Mbigi.

Sodom and gomorrah

But it is not only Mr Mbigi lamenting; another resident who has also lived in the area for more than two decades drew a grim comparison, likening the night activities at Mirema to the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The estate houses dozens of pubs and wine and spirit shops. By midnight, the streets are full of rowdy, drunk people.

“When you walk here at night, I find young people all over. How they are dressed is despicable; I don’t know what is happening with our country,” says Rosemary Ndula.

She laments the sight of young women engaging in questionable behaviour, staggering out of the bars and clubs.

Read: Mirema estate, the new home of twilight life and noise

“As property owners and residents of this area, we have seen that unless we raise our voices on this issue, in the long term, this is going to have some very serious repercussions. Trends are changing; we do not have to be rigid with our by-laws [city planning and zoning laws], but what is going on must change,” she says.

Their stories are etched with torment as the residents bemoan the fading charm of the once-homey estate. Besides the noisy nightclubs, there is the nuisance of Airbnb hosts, most of whom book the houses to hold parties.

Beyond the walls of the club, innumerable residents in this emerging beer belt can barely close their eyes for hours as the loud music from the nearly one dozen clubs within a radius of 300 metres keeps denying them that luxury.

Some of the homeowners in Mirema have moved out and are now renting out their houses to short-stay users.

Concerns over children

Raising children in estates with blaring noise is very hard. Not many toddlers can sleep through it. The ELC Judge, Judy Omange, while ruling in favour of Amani Residents Welfare Association/Mirema in an affidavit submitted by Mr Mbigi, and John Koogi, a resident of the estate, cited concerns over children.

“The petitioner is, therefore, seeking refuge from this court to protect the right of its residents to a clean and healthy environment and also ensure that the children of Mirema Drive grow up in an environment that guarantees their right to life, survival, wellbeing, protection, and development as provided by the Children Act. 32,” the court ruled.

One of the parents who has been frustrated to the point where they do not want to live in the estate is Susan Wambui, a mother of two—a fiveyear-old and a nine-month-old.

She lives barely 200 metres from Cocorico and Trinity Church. She describes the experience of putting up with the loud music and screams as a nightmare. “I am telling you this is a nightmare. I have a nine-month-old child who wakes up at just the sound of me breathing. You can imagine that with the noise, she is wide awake the whole night, and this is too much,” she told Lifestyle in a past interview.

“I’m not against partying, but it’s just too much for me and my children. I am even thinking of moving because I can’t live here one more month.” Eddy Kagera, a father of two young boys, says he was forced to move out of the neighbourhood after the clubs started opening in every corner. He says he could not bear it.

“I moved in in 2018, and after the clubs started springing up, it was even more difficult to walk my son to picked up for school. You would encounter skimpily dressed women early in the morning as they left the clubs to go home.

I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said in a past interview. There is also schools nearby and one wonders if the location is conducive for children.

Seven clubs

According to Mr Mbigi, the residents of Mirema first invited at least seven clubs to talk and iron out the noise problem, but only four sent their representatives.

“We sent letters for them to come and have a discussion on how to reduce the noise, the church and three of the clubs sent their representatives and they agreed to reduce the noise, but the other three did not,” he says. One of the clubs, Charm Lounge, has since closed. The association, which consists of about 500 members, says that they just want peace.

“So many jobs have come up along this road. But the noise is unbearable. These places run the whole night,” adds Mr Mwaura. Concerns over pubs and clubs in residential areas are not only a Mirema concern. In Nairobi’s Eastlands, Lang’ata, Dagoretti and Kilimani areas, the sounds that came through the walls of many residents, at full blast, have become frequent inconveniences.

Read: Inside Nairobi’s quest to control noise in residential areas

Data from the Nairobi County Liquor Board shows that by 2021, Starehe constituency had the highest number of registered liquor stores (88), followed by Roysambu (where Mirema is located, 48).

Lang’ata and Dagoretti North both had 35 new wine and spirits shops. In the past three years, the numbers may have doubled or tripled as pub investments in estates increased. There are noise laws in place.

Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja had last year ordered the closure of clubs over noise pollution, leading to an uproar from investors who argued that the move would lead to the loss of jobs. Mr Sakaja lifted the order. In 2018, the High Court declared the sale of alcohol in estates illegal for bars and nightclubs to operate near schools and residential areas.

“Allowing bars and liquor-selling businesses within residential areas will thus violate the residents’ right to live in dignity and a healthy environment, fundamental rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights,” said Justice Chacha Mwita.

Other estates

The judge was delivering the verdict in an application filed by the Muimara Estate Residents Association, accusing Nairobi County of allowing a trader, Kariuki Kimiti, to operate a bar within their estate, which has young and school-going children, despite objections from the residents.

But as the neighbourhoods grow, so do the nightclub investors looking to make money from the growing population. And the noise is unlikely to stop unless authorities provide harsher penalties and stop licensing pubs, nightclubs, and liquor stores set in residential areas. Sospeter Mumbi, the Member of County Assembly (MCA) of Roysambu, says, “The people who are benefiting from these clubs are mostly not from Roysambu. They come, cause mayhem, disturb us, and then go back to their respective residential areas,” he says.

A majority of Nairobi residents know that the reality is that they cannot really expect silence if one has rented a house in an uncontrolled estate.

Cheaper rents and a lower cost of living have pushed city dwellers to areas like Eastlands, Mathare, Kariobangi, and other low-income areas. But they cannot sleep, or they have to just learn how to sleep through the music, the sound systems for preaching and singing, especially on monthly vigils, and the neighbours talking loudly and blasting music through the thin walls. Their hope, they say, lies in Nairobi County leadership.

“The governor has all the powers to summon these investors and say enough is enough,” Mr Mumbi says. The current city development plan fails to clearly define, and specify, the boundaries and extent of commercial centres, says Mr Mbigi, who is also a lawyer.

“How can you allow or license pubs to operate within the vicinity of neighbourhoods and especially schools?”

Fake fertiliser: Kenya National Farmers Federation calls for compensation,"The fake fertiliser scandal is seen in some quarters as the greatest threat to Kenya’s food agenda. Farmers now want the government to ensure those involved in producing and selling the fakes are brought to book. Seeds of Gold writer Francis Mureithi talked to Dr Mwenda M’Mailutha, the CEO of Kenya National Farmers Federation (Kenaff)

You champion the interests of 837,000 farmers. How is Kenaff handling this scandal?

We have written to the Ministry of Agriculture demanding proper investigations on what exactly happened. President William Ruto has addressed the issue but we realise some things are not clear. The government must pursue the culprits and have them prosecuted. We want farmers to be compensated for the losses incurred.

There are reports of farmers being duped into buying fake seeds. What is Kenaff doing about this?

We were referred to Kenya Seeds Company, which said it is investigating the issue. A scandal of this magnitude could be an inside job. We hope the relevant arms of the government will carry out investigations. The matter has been taken up by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.

What has been the response after Kenaff wrote three memorandums to the government?

We have not received a response on whether the farmers who bought fake fertiliser will be compensated. Kenaff and other agriculture players are still waiting for this feedback.

How is your organisation helping farmers understand climate change adaptation and mitigation?

Kenaff has a 2022-26 strategic plan called “Watering the Tree for Growth”. It puts farmers at the heart of climate action and resilience to cushion them against emerging emergencies and shock. We are training farmers to contribute to climate action through water harvesting, kitchen gardens, farm forestry, afforestation, soil health and biodiversity conservation. We are mobilising farmers to plant and take care of 10 billion trees.



What policies would make farming more lucrative?

One policy that needs urgent attention is access to finance and affordable credit. This incorporates insurance, social protection for farmers and crop and livestock insurance.

Most Kenyan farmers have no life cover. Kenaff is working with insurance firms to sensitise farmers on taking medical covers. They need to remain healthy as they work on their lands.

The other area is technical advisory services. The government needs to focus on extension services if we are to transform our agriculture.

Devolved governments no longer hire extension service officers. What is Kenaff’s opinion on this?

Farmers do not have technical skills, the latest innovations in the market or access to research from public universities and other institutions that would help boost production. This is because there are no extension officers to break down the study findings and other information to farmers. Kenaff has raised concerns about this.

If that is the case, what is your organisation doing to address the problem?

We offer training to farmers through the Kenaff Knowledge Series programme which has 22 topics, including soil health, animal nutrition and agronomy. We do this through text messages, Kenaff Apps, videos, farmers field days and workshops.

The biggest challenge is our limited workforce and financial resources. If we had these, we would roll out a robust technical service to farmers all over the country.

How would you describe the success?

We have mobilised farmers’ groups and cooperative societies in 17 counties. These groups negotiate prices of their produce. Some farmers in Makueni County have found a way of exporting mangoes to Germany. We have also connected avocado farmers in Meru with markets in South Korea and Germany.

Through Kenaff, farmers have accessed credit from commercial banks.

Do farmers benefit from Wakulima markets in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisumu and other big towns?

The markets, popularly known as marikiti, are very complex. Many farmers do not gain anything from these markets.

This calls for the government to streamline operations in the markets so that farmers are allowed to sell directly to hotels and other high consumers like state institutions that get produce from marikitis.

What is Kenaff doing to encourage young people to venture into agriculture?

We have a department called Kenaff Young, which looks out for young people involved in farming. We look for models in agriculture and showcase their innovations and success stories.

Through this, we have developed leadership and exchange programmes where young farmers meet and share their experiences and knowledge.

We have established a partnership with the World Farmers Organisation in Italy, to benefit from the youth programme.

We are also working with farmers’ associations in Germany and Italy where we take young people there for three months. Kenaff is negotiating for a similar programme with the National Farmers Union in the United States.

We’re have partnered with the German development agency (GIZ), Egerton University, the University of Nairobi and other institutions in Kenya on programmes encouraging young people to try a hand in agriculture.

We are also working with 4K Clubs and the newly launched Kenya Agricultural Students Association to ignite interest in farming in children.

What is your take on disabled farmers struggling to work with unfriendly machines and equipment?

We need a concrete policy that will provide a framework which guides the formulation of laws supporting and addressing the plight of such farmers. Kenaff has boards at the county level which have representatives from disabled persons.

Do you support the proposed taxes on produce?

Kenaff is against these taxes. We need to create an enabling environment for farmers to enhance productivity and efficiency. Farmers cannot access credit to support production. There’s no good infrastructure and extension services.

Many farmers have no access to post-harvest technology, irrigation, driers and cold storage facilities. The majority are not even aware of the Warehouse Receipt Systems. Many have not formed value chain-based cooperatives.

If farmers are provided with these and are not incurring high production costs, they will have no problem paying taxes.

What would be the Kenaff scorecard for the government on agriculture be after more than a year in office?

I will give the government a C+. There is a lot to be done by the government to make farming the real backbone of Kenya’s economy. The Warehouse Receipt System and Commodity Exchange are brilliant and transformative ideas. Kenaff welcomes reforms at the Agricultural Finance Corporation to help fund priority value chains.

What to do when lumpy skin disease hits your animals,"Limping cattle is a common problem in dairy farming. I narrated last week how one of my heifers started limping on all four legs overnight. The problem was caused by a viral disease called ephemeral fever or three-day-sickness.

Fortunately, most cases of the diseases recover uneventfully within about three days with or without treatment. Such diseases are said to be self-limiting.

This week again, Francis my farmhand, reported another heifer limping on the left hind leg. He thought it was the same disease as the previous one. In medicine, we call such disease determination diagnosis by rote.

This means diagnosing a disease because the signs shown resemble the ones seen in another patient previously. It is a highly discouraged method of diagnosis for different diseases share signs.

However, a trained eye will know the signs that are common to a group of diseases or conditions and the few signs that are specific to a particular illness.

For instance, many farmers report chicken being dull, have ruffled feathers, closing eyes and diarrhoea.

Read: Meet a woman vet riding high on love for livestock

Such a description would not be useful to a doctor in diagnosing the problem because there are many chicken diseases with the same signs.

But when a doctor examines the bird physically and does some post mortem examinations, she is able to see signs such as the diarrhoea being green, chocolate, chocolate with blood streaks or yellow.

At post mortem, the doctor would also see the internal organs affected by the disease and how the illness effects look like. Therefore, it is a combination of unique disease signs that helps the doctor to make a fairly accurate diagnosis rather than just the obvious signs.

I usually tell farmers that diagnosing a disease by rote is like trying to guide someone to a location in the streets of Nairobi and telling them they will know the place when they see an M-Pesa stall.

I told Francis I would check the heifer once I got to the farm later in the day. Once I arrived, I observed the animal from a distance and saw it was feeding well. The face was bright and the body looked normal.

When the animal moved, I noted the limp on the left hind leg. It was limping from the joint below the heel.

The heifer was able to put quite some weight on the affected leg but would lift the leg if made to move fast.

I instructed Francis to put all the animals in the crush because I wanted to diagnose pregnancies and vaccinate the cows against foot and mouth disease. Once the animals were restrained, I examined their legs.

I found the limping heifer had a swollen lymph node at the base of the leg. The lower leg was swollen from the hoof joint to the area below the hock joint.

The hock is the joint that many people confuse with the animal’s knee. It is the joint below the udder.

I noticed the swollen section of the leg had two fresh wounds that oozed dilute blood and some clear fluid. I observed another heifer with the same kind of wounds at the same location on the right leg. Both animals were eating well and did not seem bothered much by the swelling and the wounds.

I concluded the animals had a mild form of lumpy skin disease or LSD. It is caused by a pox virus that is spread by mosquitoes and biting flies.

The disease is easily prevented by vaccination once a year. It mainly occurs in the rainy season when fly populations are high.

LSD vaccine is readily available in Kenya. I have vaccinated my cattle every year for the last five years without fail.

While two or three animals have shown the mild form of the disease every year, I have been spared full or even moderately severe disease even when cows in the area have shown full-blown disease.

This means the vaccine has been effective in inducing immunity in my cows.

My experience with LSD in vaccinated cattle is that it may cause swelling of the whole or part of a leg. The virus damages the walls of lymphatic vessels and causes fluid to ooze into the tissues.

Infected immune cattle will drop slightly in milk yield. Some have low grade fever while others may have some very small round swellings on the skin. The effects of the disease in vaccinated animals may last two to three days but the appetite is not affected.

In unvaccinated cattle, LSD causes large round raised swellings in the skin and mucous membranes with very high fever of up to 41 degrees Centigrade.

Deaths may be high, especially among calves. There is no specific cure for the disease but some antibiotics are known to improve the chances of recovery.

I treated my limping heifer with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent infection of the wounds and reduce swelling.

I chose to leave the second heifer to heal without medication because the damage to the leg and other effects of the infection appeared to be waning.

It is good practice to only use medication when it is extremely necessary.

 ,"In 1996, a respected elder living in Dabel, Marsabit County, prophesied that precious minerals would be discovered in the area. But just how big a blessing and later, a curse it was to become, was not clear to any of the dismissive residents he told.

While the old man died a few months later in 1996, the prophecy came to pass in 2018 when a herder found gold nuggets and sold them, kicking off a mad gold rush in the village located 64 kilometres west of Moyale town at the Kenya-Ethiopia border.

“We vividly remember how one of our elders and a seer prophesied about gold discovery, but we did not take him seriously at the time. After the discovery, we expected to reap big from it,” says Sakuye community secretary Hajj Hassan Tepo.

But the discovery of the precious mineral turned into a curse.

In March this year, eleven people—all said to be Ethiopians—were killed in a clash over how to share the resources. This was after members of two warring communities stumbled on huge deposits inside the mines and failed to agree on how to share them.

Read: Experts want laws to control mining deals

Sakuye community vice secretary Mohammed Ali Wario detailed how two rival groups of miners dug tunnels and bumped into each other and began a scrambling for gold that exploded into ethnic conflict.

Fight erupted

“They were digging from the opposite sides and met where the deposits were. When they disagreed and fought inside the mine, a vicious fight erupted among members of their communities outside,” said Mr Wario.

The government, through a Gazette notice published by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on March 13, shut down the 13 mines spread over an area of about 50 square kilometres and deployed the military to guard the area.

The mining sites are Hillo Gorgora, Hillo Orofa, Hillo Walkite, Hillo Tanzania, Hillo Irress Abamartille, Hillo Gootu, Hillo Tessum Qalicha, Hillo Karray, Hillo Hudda, Hillo QQoranjido, Shindia, Hillo Rabaalee, and Hillo Godde Haroressa.

Before the indefinite closure of the fields, miners reportedly reaped millions of shillings. There was a massive influx of miners and investors from other parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia. Dabel became a sort of shanty town teeming with more than 70,000 people drawn from several countries.

According to the miners we interviewed in Moyale, a lot of gold was mined each month.

“Gold mining is a highly secretive business and nobody would disclose how much they made. But going by the kind of business that was going on in Moyale town and the tycoons who drove all the way from Nairobi, traders raked in millions of shillings a day,” said Mr Abubakar Hassan, a resident.

After the closure, the miners said, their lives have been turned upside down with equipment and ore valued at over Sh500 million lying at the sites. They complained that they were not allowed to access or service their machines amid claims some people were still being allowed into the mines and cart away ore.

100 investors

Mr Wote Gayo, who moved into the mines in July last year and employed about 50 people, said he owned a crasher that was still at the site, and was worried that the equipment was being used by other people.

He added that with more than 100 investors like him, they estimated the property held up at the site is worth over Sh500 million.

“My crusher and other investments are worth more than Sh3 million and I am worried they are being misused. It is now two months since the mines were shut and we have not even been allowed to go and service our machines,” Mr Gayo said.

“The warring communities have since resolved their differences and we want the government to reopen the mines, not only for a select few, but for all of us. This is because we fear continued closure could result in further conflict as people try to access the mines by force,” he added.

Moyale Council of Elders Chairperson Shakur Ibrahim claimed that some rogue security officials colluded with businessmen to collect cart away ore and sold it secretly. He added that the ban should not only apply to the common man yet the rich continue to benefit.

“We thank the government for moving with speed and closing the mines when the fight erupted. But at the moment, continued closure is not serving any purpose because the mines are open for the rich who are refining the ore in Moyale and exploiting our resources,” he said.

However, Prof Kindiki reiterated that the mines would not be reopened, and hinted at extension of the closure notice.

“We want all regulations put in place to ensure that there is adequate security so that when the mines are reopened, residents of the area benefit and not a few people. We shut the mines because they had been infiltrated by criminal elements,” Prof Kindiki said in Marsabit on May 10.



Even as the mining activities contributed to impressive growth of businesses in Moyale town and lifted many jobless youths and women out of poverty, Mr Hajji Tepo said the local Sakuye community living close to the mines never benefited directly from this boom.



He said most of the revenues were smuggled through Ethiopia to Dubai and other Middle East countries and expressed concern that poverty rates and inequalities in the community were still alarmingly high despite the resources.

Mr Tepo called on the government to allow the mining to reach its full potential and ensure the local communities have a role in making decisions over the resources.

“When the mines are reopened the sharing of royalties should adhere to the law, where the national government gets 70 per cent, county government 20 per cent and the local community 10 per cent,” he said.

March conflict

Mr Wario said proper mechanisms should be put into place to avert a repeat of the March conflict. “The mines should be reopened only after instituting adequate measures to avert congestion, land degradation, use of cyanide and mercury by miners, and proper hygiene measures.”

Last month, Mining Principal Secretary Elijah Mwangi said the government would formalise the sector, with artisanal miners required to register Saccos that will be licensed to carry out mining activities. Artisanal mining committees would be formed in each county to provide guidelines on the licensing procedures, he said.

Hilo Artisanal Miners Cooperative vice secretary Mukhtar Intalo explained that plans were in top gear to register a cooperative, saying they were ready to undertake regulated mining.

“We are putting strategies in place by registering cooperatives that will ensure there is sanity in the mining sector in Dabel before we embark on pushing the State to reopen the mines,” Mr Intalo said, adding that the Sacco has already registered 3,500 members.

Moyale Youths Association Chairman Bona Adan appealed to the government to reopen the mines to allow the over 70,000 people who have now been rendered jobless to find a source of income.

Moyale Maendeleo ya Wanawake Chairperson Asna Hussein said that when the mining was going on, there were cases of gender-based violence, defilement, rape, and moral degradation. “Before the mines are reopened, these issues, including environmental degradation, should be considered and addressed,”” she said.

Remembering Benga great DO Misiani 18 years on,"For Benga fans beginning Friday and throughout the weekend, it will be an opportunity to cherish and mark the 18th anniversary since the death of the legendary Benga musician Daniel Owino (DO) Misiani.

The great musician died in a grisly road accident near Kisumu town on May 17, 2006, and was band leader of the DO 7 Shirati Jazz Band (also popularly known as the “King of history”). Born in Shirati, Tanzania, he moved to Kenya in the mid-60s where he groomed his illustrious Benga musical career.

Speaking to Saturday Nation, Benga music producer George Ouma of Jojo Records recalled the great times he had shared with Misiani.

“He was a jovial and remorseful person who never held a grudge. In the event of any dispute he would ensure it was settled as soon as possible, ” Ouma added.

Notably, Ouma also recalled having produced some of Misiani's great songs like  Ukombozi I and II  and The late Julius Nyerere.

Some of Misiani’s popular songs include Isabella Muga, Lala Salama,  Kiseru, Christina Jaber and Safari ya Amerika  Notably  Safari ya Amerika was dedicated to his fans in the USA, where he occasionally toured to perform. While members of the Paris-based Congolese Soukous Stars did a rendition of Kiseru on their Nairobi Night medley song.

Misiani, like some of his counterparts, occasionally stirred controversy on some of his songs. Notably on Bim en Bim which put him into some trouble with some government authorities for mistaken messaging in the song.

Similarly, speaking to Saturday Nation,   yesterday  Benga musician Linet Aluoch Pamba recalled Misiani’s great potential in music.

“He was my greatest inspiration in music, especially when I was still a member of his DO 7 Shirati Jazz alongside others like his widow Queen Babito, Grace Tobias,  Odira Pombe Kali and Odhis, “she said.

Linet, who leads the Kisumu-based Karapul Jazz Band, recalled being among those who accompanied Misiani on some of his musical tours to Europe. Notably, his final tour to Europe in 2005, when they performed in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany.

During Misiani’s musical tours to the USA, Linet singled out Kenyan promoter Mathews Anyumba as amongst those on the frontline of supporting his shows there. Misiani’s son Jared Aywayo is also based in the USA.

As Linet pointed out, with no special concert set for this week in his honour, she will join most of Misiani’s fans in celebrating him online.

“Most of us who worked with him will be mainly sharing his music online alongside his fans,” Linet said.

She has also recently taken a break from live performances with plans to resume soon.

Some of the leading FM stations featuring Benga music like Ramogi FM, Nam  Lolwe FM, Dala FM and Lake Victoria FM are expected to dedicate some shows to Misiani’s music.

"‘As a woman, there’s pressure to constantly lead and excel on all fronts’","What's the most prized possession in your office?

I enjoy the view outside my office the most. I find it inspiring and limitless, which resonates with my personality.

My first name means a falcon, whereas Nilofer means a water lily. It's like you fly high, gallop, and fall like thunder in the water.

Your work demands lots of travel to different countries. How have the diverse experiences shaped you as an individual?

It has broadened my worldview significantly. You know, I was born and brought up in a small town in India. And, when you grow up in such an environment, your world is very limited in itself.

Your relationships, your network, your families, and your group of friends. This job has exposed me to different cultures, political systems, and developmental challenges.

All these experiences have made me more understanding and appreciative of diversity.

What’s the toughest part of settling into a new country, especially as a career woman?

I think I've grown into this role, as this is my fourth representative's role, and while I might seem to dive headfirst into new jobs, honestly, it wasn’t always this way.

In my initial career progression, there was extra pressure and the burden to prove a point. You know, I am here, I have arrived.

And I realised that it’s extremely burdensome especially when you are a woman because you are often put under surveillance.

People are going to put you on a test; they want to see how you’re doing, how you’re able to manage the issues, conflicts, and all of that.

But as you grow into roles, you realise that everything has its own time to address it. Over time, throughout these different jurisdictions, I've learned there’s no need to rush in to prove yourself.

In basketball, there’s an interesting saying: “Lead with your offhand.” Whether you’re right or left-handed, it means developing your weaker side to become more well-rounded.

Just like in basketball, as a woman, there’s the pressure to constantly ‘lead’ on all fronts – excelling in every area and being visible everywhere.

And that's an unnecessary pressure that you put on yourself. But later in my career, I didn't necessarily think that was this important.

If you could tell me, drawing from what you've just said, you often travel alone, and your family still lives in India, how do you adjust to new postings, say the one in Kenya, with your family not around?

You know, it has both sides to it. The better part of it is that you go and start your work without having to think about family logistics.

But the downside is you feel very lonely in the initial days, and it takes time to make friends. Work can easily become your whole world.

Thirty years in senior leadership positions is quite a long time. What has helped you to stay in those positions?

When I reflect on my career path, it fills me with immense gratitude. It's been a journey of muddying my boots and soiling my hands, literally.

I value those experiences very much because I understand the ground reality very well, from the development nuances to the interface between politics and development. I have worked in countries like Afghanistan, countries in South Asia, Central Asia and now, in Africa.

I have seen the vast spectrum of developmental challenges across continents. The way the governments run, the geopolitics, the macroeconomics, and the situations there. These experiences have been extremely helpful for me.

What do you love most about Kenya?

I love travelling in this place. And I love the sheer green. This is one very beautiful country.

What career advice would you give to those seeking to climb up the career ladder?

Never give up too early. Because I know as a young professional woman, there are a lot of obligations that you will face. And sometimes it can take you on a guilt trip.

You know, like you are neglecting your family and other responsibilities. I say, embrace it but don’t let it hold you back.

Notably, this applies in many ways to men too. Importantly, take every roadblock as an opportunity to grow, and enjoy what you're doing.

What does tomorrow look like for a child in Kenya, and in any other part of the world?

Primarily, I do see there's a lot of hope and optimism. It is about ensuring that we come together because the time to act is now.

And we just have about barely five to six years before we hit the finishing line to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)2030.

I strongly believe that it is a doable proposition, and Kenya will be able to achieve its commitment to SDGs for children, if we can bring in our collective efforts, both in terms of our resources, ensuring that the fund flow for those commitments, and the budgetary allocations for the children are sustained.

Pulse of the Street: Freezing city life through the lens,"In the hustle and bustle of the city, where ambition collides with disappointment, there exists a group of silent observers – street photographers.

This is a generation of young people who, armed with amateur equipment and towering determination, set up their cameras in various Nairobi streets ready to freeze urban life through their skills. We explore their motivations and creative processes as they talk about the legacy they seek to leave.

Dennis Rayori, 25                  Kakashots PhotographyI am a student at the University of Nairobi pursuing a degree in environmental and biosystems engineering, but my dream is to build a career in music and theatre.

I started KAKASHOTS photography in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic as a company that offered graphics design services, but in the process, I learnt a lot about photography and videography.

Initially, my main motive for diving into photography was to create content. My very first video, which I produced without spending much money, received positive feedback from my social media followers. That encouraged me and fueled my passion for photography, and eventually, I turned it into a source of income.

After the coronavirus pandemic, my interest in photography blossomed. As an artist, I decided to start doing my own projects. Armed with determination, I turned to YouTube for guidance. I learned how to set up a camera, record footage, and edit it. My first video received positive response from viewers, and this marked the beginning of my photography journey.

In my trade, I prioritise speed and unique colours. I like vibrant hues and use various techniques to set my work apart. Above all, I strive for client satisfaction by delivering both speed and quality.

As a videographer and photographer, my work begins on set. I visualise the desired outcome and focus on specific images. In every shoot, I choose props that yield the best results with minimal post-processing work. This approach ensures that I provide excellent services to each client without compromising on quality.

One thing that fascinates me about working in Nairobi city is the vibrant scenery of the streets. It is an experience unique to Nairobi, and I appreciate the city’s beauty. Recently, a Tanzanian friend who was visiting for the first time marveled at Nairobi's aesthetics, and this reinforced my desire to capture its full essence through photography.

Despite challenges like weather and security concerns, street photography thrives here.

I earn about Sh60,000 from my hustle, which is not enough to cater for all my needs. I charge between Sh300 and Sh2,000 per photo depending on the package a client chooses.

I see about five clients a day and work six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday. I normally set up my camera along Muindi Mbingu Street. On the streets, I approach clients who have nice outfits or those with creative and unique tastes and interest them in my services.

To thrive as a street photographer, you must have the right type of lenses. You have to consider the subject of your photos.While at work, I often plan a photograph’s composition before I snap. However, if someone requests a photo with the entire building in the background, we do that during the post-editing process where we also remove unwanted individuals from the frame to maintain privacy. Many dislike being photographed without their consent, and it is also illegal to do that, so before taking a photo on the streets, we approach the subject politely and ask for permission. Most agree, and their happiness becomes our joy.

Thankfully, in Nairobi and many towns in Kenya, street photographers like me are free to do their jobs and put their talent to use. I like that through quality images, we help preserve our clients’ memories. It is a profession that indeed empowers young people.

Felix Onyango, 21 Felz shots PhotographyI am a student at Egerton University pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in communication and mass media. My dream is to become a journalist. To me, photography is about more than capturing images. It is about preserving memories. Photography is my passion, and it is a skill I have honed alongside my media studies.

It's all about storytelling, and I find it effortless to express myself through photography. Cameras have my heart, I can't explain why. With a year of photography experience, my greatest challenge is affording the lenses I need. For now, I'm using the basic ones where I have fun zooming in and playing with exposure.

Capturing high-quality photos begins with understanding your camera. Cameras offer various settings. The resolution, measured in pixels, affects image size. When exporting images for editing, consider the software's requirements. Some software sometimes automatically adjusts images, depending on settings.

Personally, I lean toward Lightroom because it allows me to focus on any subject, whether a person or an object.

Third-party photography apps have revolutionised the way we capture moments. Consider connecting your camera to your phone wirelessly…the AI, (Artificial intelligence) makes it seamless. It's like having a knowledgeable companion behind the lens, ensuring optimal results.

I charge Sh100 for edited photos and Sh50 for non-edited photos.

I can’t say how much I earn on average because at times I don’t get clients. Because I have to go to school, I don’t do this on fulltime basis. I don't have specific days considered for working, but I always avail myself when I am not burdened with schoolwork. I move from place to place. While on school holiday I set base in Kisumu, while the rest of the time I am in Nakuru.

Ultimately, my goal is to keep growing as a photographer, to continue exploring the world through my lens, and to share meaningful images that resonate with viewers. Whether that’s primarily through street photography or branching out into other genres down the line, I’ll let my passion and creative instincts guide me. Journalism is what excites me most.

Irene Kimosop, 26            I.K Pixel StudiosI graduated with a Diploma in Project Management from Kenya Institute of Project Management (KIPM) in year 2019. Initially my dream was to be a journalist, but I am still happy being a photographer.

With two years of experience, I've majored in capturing and editing images that tell compelling stories.

Each day brings new learning opportunities, and I always strive for creativity. I got training in editing from a professional photographer, Mr K Conlon in 2022, although I relied more on my passion and the skills I learned on the job.

I focused on refining my editing skills, and used the skills I had learned as a former model to create impactful images.

I enjoy outdoor shoots, and portrait photography because of its ability to capture the essence of a person’s character and emotions. I work alongside a talented team of makeup artists and hairstylists. It's about teamwork, drawing inspiration from others, and having a keen eye for details. It's not just about capturing moments but also crafting them through meticulous editing.

Understanding your subjects is key. Even if their vision differs from yours, adapt and find common ground.

The toughest project I've ever handled was when I had to take up a wedding assignment at the last minute. The experience was both exhilarating and demanding, as there was little time to plan. I stepped in when their previous photographer fell through, so I was more of a backup.

Despite facing traffic delays on the very day and missing some vital equipment, I delivered my best work. The challenge I had was balancing the client's expectations. Originally it was supposed to be a five-hour shoot, but I had to extend my time as the client kept coming up with different requests throughout the day. It was difficult, but I had to deliver.

Navigating client requests and discerning genuine projects can be challenging. Sometimes, last-minute shoots or projects can come with unexpected twists. Imagine agreeing to an outdoor shoot, only to have the location change abruptly. I was once booked by two men for an outdoor shoot in an unfamiliar location. I was with a group of men and as we approached the location, I felt uncomfortable.

Being the only woman, without security, and with two unknown male clients leading me to a strange location, I knew I had to find a way out. Relying on my instincts, I waited for the perfect moment, took a motorbike and escaped from the questionable shoot. Ours is an unpredictable yet rewarding craft.

I earn Sh80,000 a month on average. I have different charges depending on the package a client picks. Wedding and birthday coverage ranges between Sh10,000 and Sh140,000 depending on a client's demands.

A photo costs Sh150 while an outdoor photo session costs a minimum of Sh7,000. I.K Pixel Studios is located in Tassia estate and I work every day except Tuesdays.

I use social media and referrals to get clients.

Reagan Ochieng, 24 Stavi Arts PhotographyI am a final year student at the University of Eldoret pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education, but my passion is in photography and videography.

I have been in this business for four years, and my expertise lies in editing, camera setting, and picture retouching. My tools include the camera itself, a sturdy stand, a speedlight for controlling light, and a softbox which modifies the quality of light.As an outdoor photographer, I focus on capturing natural scenes, and I rely on Photoshop for editing.

To ensure a successful client experience, establishing a good rapport is crucial. Light-hearted humour can put clients at ease and encourage genuine smiles during shoots. Before starting my work, I spend time asking my client questions and getting to know them to make them comfortable.

If for any reason a client expresses dissatisfaction with my work and seeks a refund, I follow a systematic approach. First, I inquire about the specific issue. If it relates to lighting or other technical aspects, I address it promptly. If the concern can’t be resolved through editing, I propose a re-shoot.

Balancing academic commitments with my creative pursuits can be demanding, so to strike that equilibrium I deliberately schedule photo sessions on weekends. This allows me to focus on my studies during the week.

Mwiti Victor Lee, 23Bleev Creations PhotographyI'm a medical student at The University of Nairobi, pursuing Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. My dream career is to become a doctor, but passion led me to photography.

I initially experimented with a friend's camera, and gradually learned the ropes in my leisure time. Eventually, I bought my own equipment. I focus primarily on outdoor and street photography, as indoor clients are scarce.

My debut event was a dinner party for nurses held at Swiss Lenana Mount Hotel. The photos I captured exceeded my own expectations. Even though it was my first time to take professional photos, the results spoke volumes. Seeing people genuinely happy with my work fueled my passion.

In street photography, I often receive requests from clients to capture their portraits. I scout for suitable locations, often around the central business district (CBD) or other outdoor spots. However, not all clients are pleasant. Some doubt the quality of my work. Also, approaching strangers to request them to take photos for a fee can be quite a daunting task.

When buying equipment, I consider the lighting of my main locations and the environment. Considering power sources to keep the equipment fully charged and having the right lenses is highly important. For example, wide-angle lenses are best for outdoor shoots as they can capture expansive scenes. Narrow-angle lenses suit indoor settings. It's a delicate dance between vision and gear.

To successfully capture a client’s natural expressions, I ensure they feel comfortable and at ease during the shoot. In the editing process, I aim to make the pictures stand out and leave a lasting impression on the client. I don’t just go for ordinary snapshots. I also strive to maintain a natural aesthetic in my edits, and to capture emotions clearly.

How much I earn depends on the number of clients I get in a given duration. Just like any other business, there are high and low seasons. However, what I get is enough for my current lifestyle.

I charge Sh200 per photo and I work every day. To get new clients, I advertise my work on my social media accounts.

Safara out for blood after a sonar swindle,"My plan for today had been to spend the entire day at the Baraza Media Lab, relaxing by watching the premieres of 19 short movies at the Solutions Film Festival, sponsored by the Skoll Foundation, and presented by ‘Docubox’ that is headed by the legendary film director and founder, Judith Kibinge.

Instead, I was hot on the heels of some city swindlers, whom I am determined to see put behind bars if they do not do the right thing by The Safara. But I am getting ahead of my tale today.

Let’s roll back the clock many years back to when I was in Kenyatta University taking my undergraduate degree.There was this dude, Dan Odhiambo, who ran the printing shop.

So we meet up end of April 2024, in the middle of all my hassling, and Dan tells me he works for ‘Albat and Lari Solutions,’ a procurement firm on Gitanga Road.

He has a deal for me.

“Can you supply us with Sonar PR, an aquatic herbicide?”

“I can supply solar flares if there is a profit in it, Odhis,” I chuckled. “Why can’t you do it yourself, Dan?”

“Can’t!” Odhiambo shrugged. “Conflict of interest.”

Which is how I found myself at the offices of Albat and Lari, admiring the smart apartments of Gitanga Close, vowing to live in such a place myself someday soon. “Kusota na kuteseka ni kwa mda tu,” I said.

Meeting a man called Martin Opondo, he formally took note of my Expression of Interest to supply the Sonar herbicide, and a lady called Susan was at hand with the Local Purchase Order (LPO).

They agreed I bring a sample to their offices ASAP for approval first.

No sooner had I called Dan Odhiambo when the meeting with Susan and Opondo was done, and he had yet another useful tip.

“Go to Comet Mall,” Dan advised. “You will find a Sonar sample there.”

I did, and after paying Sh20,000 for the sample litres, I was on my way with it to the Albat & Lari offices, where Susan and Opondo took it.

A short while later, the email came through – the Hustler had been cleared to supply 1,000 litres of the aquatic herbicide. If I did not have the capacity (money) to do so all in one lot, I could bring it in batches.

“Mr Li,” I called my Chinese connection, “I need the 500K I deposited with you.”

“You longer no int-lest in investment in Safara Mass Colour company?”

“I need to double that dough if I’m to make your million by end month.”

“Be care full out there mai-kor,” the Chinese mall mandarin warned me.

“I know where they work,” I chuckled to him. “If they try to pull a fast one, you send your men to promote them all to higher glory, okay sir?”

Then Dan Odhiambo popped up, as a friend, with one more Ace card.

“I know a wholesaler of Sonar called Onesmus Mbaku Kimanzi,” he told me. “He can supply the stuff at Sh17,000 instead of Sh20,000 per litre.”

I quickly did the math – that would leave me with Sh75,000 from the half a million shillings that tycoon Li Zhang had returned to my bank account. Half the ‘blood money’ that had been in the light blue duffel bag when my cousin Safari got washed away in those April flash floods.

That would pay my 25K flat rent, another 25K would be Neo’s fees (hopefully softening Laura’s heart too) and the remaining 25,000 bob carry me daily through May.

Meanwhile, on April 30, via Mpesa, I sent Sh100,000 for 25 per cent of the 100 litres to the wholesaler Onesmus M Kimanzi, with the till number reflecting as ‘Danada Merchants.”

The following day, after pressure from Dan Odhiambo (who said I would be paid ASAP after Labour Day), I deposited another Sh325,000 into the bank account of Danada Merchants.

Thursday, May 2, I am calling Onesmus Mbaka Kimanzi.

“We finished our chemical supplies at our Industrial Area warehouse,” he told me. “In-fact we are on the way to collect more from Namanga.”

“Who’s we?” I asked.

“Me and Dan,” Onesmus Kimanzi replied.

And that is when it hit me – ‘Danada Merchants’ was of course DAN Odhiambo. He was in cahoots with this so-called wholesaler Onesmus.

And ‘Albat & Lari’ were in all probability, a scam.

How could I have been so trusting of a chap I last saw in KU years ago?

I took the case to Central Police Station, and one of the investigators quickly confirmed after a trace that while my ‘wholesaler’ had claimed they had spent the night in Namanga, the location was really Roysambu.

To add insult to injury, after I tried to reverse the transaction, Onesmus actually called me to ask WHY I was trying to reverse the transaction.

Then to compound it all, I get an email from Albat & Lari ‘confirming’ they received the 100 litres of Sonar, but would only pay when I supplied them with all 250 litres. That is why the ‘Safara’ is seeing red today!

If these swindlers don’t refund the cheddar, then the DCI will have to go for the criminals – although I have also provided the chinku mandarin with names, numbers and addresses of these scammers, if necessary.

"Vera Sidika: Marriage was boring, the old Vera is now back!","In the kingdom of celebrity conspiracy and societal fascination, few names command attention quite like Vera Sidika. Renowned as a Kenyan socialite and entrepreneur, Vera’s journey from humble beginnings to high-profile status has been nothing short of captivating.

Known for her unapologetic attitude, glamorous lifestyle and fearless demeanour, Vera’s every move is criticised and celebrated in equal measure by her legion of fans and critics. She is currently starring in the second season of The Real Housewives of Nairobi reality show. In this interview, she speaks about her achievements, setbacks, and the challenges of navigating public life in the digital age

1. Having been in the limelight for more than a decade, what would you consider your greatest achievement so far?I have done a lot that most people can relate to but being a mum is the greatest of them all. It's very special, especially being a mum to a boy and a girl. It is very exciting since I get to experience both sides. I love watching my children grow. I spend most of my time with them. I love taking care of them and I plan to give them the best life. And, I am not getting any more children. I need a break so that I can also enjoy life and do other things. If I ever add more children, it will be probably six or seven years from now.

2. Looking back at your pre-celeb life, in what ways do you feel the digital space has changed?I became famous after the local music scene embraced the video vixen culture. I was the talk of the town when I appeared on P-Unit’s You Guy video in 2012 because of my curves and confident demeanour. In 2014, I also appeared on rapper Prezzo’s video for the track My Gal, where I also took command of the video. Since then, I have continued to rise, and I believe I’ve become a role model for many.

For anyone who wants to become a socialite, my advice is, go for it. However, you must understand that it comes naturally and you can't force it. I did not choose to be famous, people made me famous when I showcased my skills publicly. Make sure you are natural. The world is too big and there is a place for everybody. I have been famous for over a decade so I know what I’m talking about. I have paved the way for all of them. Understand that social media is not kind so have a tough skin and have fun.

3. Why did you close your salon business?I did it in 2022 but I did not speak about it. The closure had nothing to do with me going bankrupt. It was because I moved back to Nairobi and I was involved in other things. I spent more time in Nairobi so it was hard to focus on a business when I was away.

You know, if something is not working, you don’t have to force it. Also, running a business is not easy. Even successful people have failed in business. There is nothing to be shy about a business not doing well. It doesn't mean that you are broke or that your life will not go on. You close it, open another one and life goes on, just a little less stressfully. Sometimes people hold on to things and they end up crashing.

4. What should your fans expect from Season Two of TRHoN?It is spicy, exciting and amazing. I feel like I got a bit wild this season since I am single, and there is also a bit of drama. Also, at some point, it will get emotional. My fans will also see another side of me as a mother of two. My son (Ice Brown) is also in this season and I love it. Being single is very good for me. Marriage was boring and there were things I could not do in Season One because my ex-husband (Brown Mauzo) was around. In Season Two, I am doing it with a lot of authenticity. I am also not pregnant like I was in Season One and that means I was able to do all the activities.

5. Are your frequent travels attributed to your new relationship with a foreign partner?Hahaha, I travel a lot because I get a lot of international gigs. This is exciting as I also like going on vacations abroad. I have not been visiting the boring countries. I have gone to all the fun countries where there is life and parties. I have been to over 30 states in the US. I am almost finishing the whole of America. Travelling is fun and super exciting and I can't wait for my children to grow up so that I can travel with them.

About my partner, I don’t want any commitment at the moment. I just want to have fun so the person I am with is not there for a serious relationship. I’m single because I don't want it to be serious…niko 50/50 one leg in, one leg out. I also don’t want him to be committed to me. He is Nigerian.

"Biden, Trump agree on the dates of Presidential debate","US President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to face off in two debates on June 27 and September 10, setting up the highest stakes moments yet of the race for the White House.

""As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,"" Biden said on social media.

Trump called Biden ""the worst debater"" he has ever faced.

""I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September,"" he posted on social media.

CNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O, said the first debate would be held in their Atlanta studio with no audience, and would be moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Georgia is one of November's most closely contested states.

The candidates also accepted an invitation from ABC DIS.N, which will host a second debate on September 10.

A separate vice presidential debate has been proposed for July, after the Republican National Convention.

Key differences between the two sides remained on the terms of engagement. Biden said he would participate in those two debates under strict rules to reduce interruptions, while Trump called for more than two - and a very large venue ""for excitement purposes.""

Independent US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr claimed in a new post on X that he will meet the criteria to participate in the CNN debate before the June 20 deadline. It remained unclear if he will qualify.

CNN requires its debate candidates to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold and receive at least 15 per cent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed only 13 per cent of Americans would vote for Kennedy.

Earlier in the day Kennedy said Biden and Trump "" are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.""

Debates, which will draw a US live television audience in the tens of millions, are fraught with risks for both candidates, who face a tight race and low enthusiasm from voters.

Biden aides think debates could hurt Trump by exposing his positions on issues, including abortion, that they regard as political vulnerabilities.

Trump aides see Biden as prone to verbal slip-ups that could amplify voter concerns about the 81-year-old president's age. Trump will be 78 by the time the first debate is held.

""Both candidates will be under greater scrutiny than they have ever been due to their age,"" Alan Schroeder, a professor emeritus at Northeastern University who wrote the book ""Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trial."" He called the debate ""one of the only moments in which the candidates don't have complete control.""

The first debate would take place after the June 15 conclusion of the Group of Seven summit in Italy and Trump's criminal trial in New York.

Biden's debate proposal, the first formal offer by his campaign, ditched the decades-old tradition of three fall debates and called for direct negotiations between the Trump and Biden campaigns over the rules.

Asked about any preference for format or topics, Biden-Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said some details remained to be worked out.

The move to accept debates shows Biden is willing to take a calculated risk to boost his opinion poll numbers in a race in which he is trailing Trump in key battleground states. In addition to his age, voters remain concerned about Biden's handling of the economy.

Trump, who refused to debate his rivals during the Republican nominating race, has in recent weeks been challenging Biden to a one-on-one matchup with him, arguing that debates should be held before early voting begins in some states.

He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt the debate should be two hours and that both men should be required to stand.

Biden's team earlier requested that only broadcast networks that hosted Republican primary debates in 2016 and Democratic primary debates in 2020 be eligible to host this year.

Only four networks hosted debates for both parties during those election cycles: CNN, Telemundo CMCSA.O, CBS News and ABC News.

The Biden team showed no signs of accepting Trump's invitation for more debates. A Biden campaign spokesperson declined comment on the issue.

Biden said he would not take part in the traditional televised showdowns organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, rejecting the nonpartisan organization that has managed them since 1988.

Trump had also expressed interest in bypassing the commission, and the Republican National Committee announced in 2022 that the party would leave the commission's debate system altogether.

In a letter explaining the Biden campaign's decision, campaign chair Jennifer O'Malley Dillon cited the commission's past struggles to keep candidates from violating debate rules.

She notified the commission that Biden will not be participating in the three general-election debates sponsored by the group, which are scheduled for September 16, October 1 and October 9. The commission could not be reached for a comment.

""The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home — not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors, who consume valuable debate time with noisy spectacles of approval or jeering,"" Dillon said.

Biden's campaign also pressed for a debate that would occur before early voting started and without the participation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or any other independent or third-party candidates.

Football was my escape from a life of crime and drug abuse,"William Gitama, 19, is a fast-rising striker. He won the Golden Boot in the Costa Daurada Cup tournament in Barcelona, Spain last month with the Talanta Hela Under-19 boys team after scoring three goals in five matches, which helped Kenya win the title.

Last year, Gitama's talent shone bright during the Chapa Dimba and Talanta Hela tournaments where he was named the Most Valuable Player in the coastal region. Due to his impressive talent, he was admitted to top flight team Bandari FC.

Gitama grew up in Kisauni, Mombasa, an area that has consistently had a bad reputation for crime, drug abuse among youth and is home to teenage gangs.

How was your childhood? I grew up in Kisauni, Mombasa, and that has been my home for nearly two decades. My education began at Fahari Primary School, followed by a brief stint at St Anthony Boys Kitale where I stayed for two years before I transferred to Serani Boys High School in Mombasa.

It was my exceptional performance in sports that earned me a coveted scholarship to St Antony. I was scouted during the East Africa Primary School Games by coach Peter Mayoyo, who teaches Kiswahili at the school. During my time at St Anthony, I was honoured to receive a call-up to the national Under-17 team that played against Djibouti in a World Cup qualifier match played in Dar es Salaam in 2018 where we won 7-0.

I started playing football at the age of six and I have never looked back. I am grateful for the journey and the lessons it has taught me. I now know the importance of discipline and perseverance, and how to balance between the game and my studies. My parents and siblings have also been very supportive.

Now, as a Bandari FC player, I am working hard to contribute to the success of the club.

How was it growing up in Kisauni?In my childhood, I witnessed many friends abandon football at a young age to indulge in drugs, and some even fell victim to mob justice and died young. Sadly, this was a common occurrence in my neighbourhood. I am grateful that my talents steered me away from such activities.

People often point to idleness as the reason young people indulge in alcohol and drug abuse. They argue that an idle mind is the devil's workshop, and it is true. When young people find themselves with nothing to do, they may turn to drugs to alleviate boredom, seek excitement, or simply to pass the time. This pattern can hasten the path to addiction, as considerable time is spent on drug consumption. I am glad I found football to fill up my free time.

How did winning the Golden Boot award in Spain make you feel?Last season, I scored seven goals in six league matches for the Bandari youth team, but unfortunately I got an ankle injury that forced me out of action for three months. Coming from an injury and rising to top form was a huge blessing. The award came as a surprise. I just believed in myself and God. My dream is to play football in Europe, probable in Spain, a country that offers the best opportunities for football growth due to its modern facilities and the government’s huge investment in the sport.

Was it always your dream to join the Bandari senior team?Joining the Dockers was truly a dream come true. It wasn't an easy journey, I had to push myself hard on the pitch.I was extremely anxious when I joined the senior team. I can vividly recall my debut game for Bandari. It was against Nzoia Sugar at our home ground in Mbaraki, a match we won 2-1. I was introduced in the final moments of the game. The unfamiliar pitch, the atmosphere, and the huge crowd were all new to me.

I am deeply thankful to my coach John Baraza who has consistently encouraged me. He told me to have faith in myself and to always give my all on the field whenever I am given the chance to play.

What activities do you engage in during your leisure time? I enjoy playing Play Station (PS), a pastime that has significantly honed my football abilities.

What are your preferred dishes?I love Swahili food such as chapati and coconut beans (maharagwe ya nazi), biryani, and pilau.

What advice would you give to aspiring young footballers?Be you. Football is a lucrative profession, and I can attest to this as I am currently supporting my family through my earnings from the sport. Additionally, perseverance is key. I have witnessed some of my peers lose hope and abandon the sport due to challenging economic conditions yet they were very talented. Above all, maintain discipline and have faith in God.

 ,"The national government has upgraded the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) in Kisumu to a Level 6 facility.

Locals in Kisumu commonly refer to it as 'Russia Hospital', a name coined because of the good relations between Kenya and the Russian government.

The JOOTRH is one of the oldest health facilities in the country, serving thousands of patients in the Western region.

The hospital is located along the Kakamega-Kisumu Highway just before Kondele Police Station on a 55.6 acre land.

The elevation comes after a recent evaluation and inspection conducted by the Kenya Health Professional Oversight Authority (KHPOA).

Kisumu County Government had initially requested the national government to take over the running of the facility due to financial constraints.

According to the JOOTRH administration, the health oversight body awarded the facility a score of 85 per cent after a recent inspection on August 1, 2023.

But what does the upgrading of the public hospital to a Level 6 facility means to local residents?

For starters, with the Ministry of Health taking over the facility, it shall be on the same level with Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), and Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital (KUTRH) which are run by the national government.



Funds

Another advantage the facility is bound to have is the unlocking of funds especially from the national government and other partners, therefore enhancing the quality of services offered to residents.

Currently, 70 per cent of the hospital's resources come from the county government.

The regional referral hospital is serving patients drawn from 10 counties within the Lake Region Economic Bloc.

This has however been a thorn in the flesh of Governor Anyang' Nyong’o's administration since it had to run the Level 5 facility at its own operation cost.



Surgeries and procedures

According to the County Chief Executive Committee Member of Health Dr Gregory Ganda, the upgrading of JOOTRH means that the facility will now be equipped with both professional personnel and medical equipment to conduct high-level surgeries and save residents the agony of having to travel far to undergo such medical procedures.

Currently, the facility has 11 functional operational theatres, including general, Accident & Emergency, and three dedicated maternity theatres.



Service Delivery

The upgrade is expected to improve medical service delivery. For instance, the creation of consultation rooms to promote patients' privacy.

With sufficient funding, the facility can procure essential pharmaceutical products to improve access to quality care.

The hospital plans to erect relevant signage in respective service areas to ease the flow of service provision to patients.

JOOTRH has a 13-bed ICU with operational patient monitors.



Cancer

Already the county government had started the construction of a cancer centre. But with financial challenges the project stalled.

With these hitches, Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Susan Nakhumicha pledged Sh100 million to complete the construction of the cancer centre.

If completed, the cancer centre will ultimately reduce the need for patients to travel long distances for cancer treatment.

Celestine Agutu, a resident of Kisumu said that it will be a relief for cancer patients and those with chronic illnesses who currently seek services in Eldoret and Nairobi.

“When the resources are available for the public facility, then there will be enough budget allocation and equipment to take care of the needs of the residents,” said Ms Agutu.

Presently, the regional referral hospital offers oncology services for both adults and children.



Recommendations

The health oversight authority pointed out that the facility needed to improve waste management within the hospital, increase the number of staff and streamline its emergency preparedness and outpatient department.

The authority also proposed that JOOTRH expand the Emergency and Accident department to accommodate more patients.

Previously the facility has been on the receiving end with complaints of drug shortage, blood and generally slow service delivery.

Kevin Otieno, a resident of Kisumu suggests that the national government employs more health workers at the facility to manage the increasing number of patients seeking medical attention.

“The hospital needs to recruit additional staff, including critical care nurses, general nurses, medical officers, specialists and medical officer interns. This may necessitate increased budgetary allocations to support the growing workload,” said Mr Otieno.

JOOTRH currently acts as a training ground for medical students from Maseno and Uzima universities.

During a recent visit to the facility, CS Nakhumicha applauded Governor Nyong'o's administration for surrendering the management of JOOTRH to the national government and castigated some county governments that have clung to similar big health facilities, under the guise of generating on-source revenue at the expense of poor service delivery.

“This is not good thinking because it has an effect on service delivery. Our people need quality health services closer to them and we must have a discussion on how to run these facilities and even the sharing of revenue,” she said.

Betty Adera: Serving communities at the grassroots enriches my life,"When we are ushered into Betty Adera’s home in Nairobi’s Loresho area, one thing immediately catches my attention - the documentation of memoirs and experiences through art, drawings and photos. Her walls are a museum of sorts.

Among other things, Ms Adera is a Global Public Health and Policy Specialist with over 22 years of Senior Management experience in both local and international NGOs. Currently, she is the Global Senior Technical Advisor for HIV/Aids, Health, and Nutrition at Global Communities, backstopping programmes in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.

She is also the founder of the Betty Adera Foundation, which collaborates with grassroots women and youth to champion girls' education, gender equality, and equity, as well as challenge all forms of gender-based violence.

Are you an artist or just a collector?

Well, I am not an artist myself, but my last-born son is so good at drawings. Some of his drawings are on these walls. But I am a collector, and that adds to the colour, life, and vibrance of our home. Whenever I travel to another country, which I do a lot, I must bring back a souvenir from that land and add it to the collection.

Speaking of travelling, you are currently in charge of four continents; how do you manage?

My role means working across several timelines. While I mostly operate from here in Nairobi, it also means that I have to ensure I am not falling behind on my deliverables, so it is not unusual for you to catch me at a work meeting at 3 am.

Where did your journey begin?

I grew up in a village called Wouth Ogik in Migori County. Wuoth Ogik in Dholuo means the “end of the journey or mwisho wa safari”. Coming from such a place if you are not careful, that name can easily define you. I had a normal childhood as the sixth of eight siblings born to teachers. This meant the discipline bar was set very high for us. My parents were disciplinarians, and some of the values they instilled in us, such as hard work, have stuck with me to this day and I instil the same in my sons. I especially remember my dad urging us all to study hard, as education was and still is the equalizer for all. He would be so proud to learn that by God’s grace, I am set to graduate with a PhD in Global Public Health from EUCLID University at some point this year.

What kind of sibling were you?

I was the snitch! I laugh when I remember this! I am the one who would always tell on my siblings to my dad and get them caned thoroughly. I had a great relationship with my dad. He passed away in 1986, but the memories I shared with him are just as fresh in my mind today. I am the only one who used to make his fried eggs - he loved my cooking, though I was very young. Though I got into trouble with my siblings for snitching, they would also use me if they needed anything from him, as he would hardly say no to me. So, it's sort of balanced.

How did you choose your career path?

I loved studying and was an equally bright student. I went to Migori Primary School, then qualified for Kenya High School, and later transitioned to the University of Nairobi (UoN), where I acquired a Bachelor's degree in Arts and Social Work and graduated in 1997. It was at the University of Nairobi that I knew I wanted to be a community-level person—a grassroots empowerment kind of person. By this time, I was married and a mother of one.

We then moved to Homabay Town, and because I did not want to sit idle after graduation, I approached a local high school in search of a teaching job. I approached the head teacher then and told him that I had no teaching qualifications by any standards, but I spoke good English. I was able to convince him and that is how I got my first job, earning Sh7,000. Looking back, the lesson I take away from this experience is do not despise humble beginnings; start somewhere and grow from there.

Ms  Betty Adera is a Global Public Health and Policy Specialist with over 22 years of Senior Management experience in both local and international NGOs.

How has the journey been?

Well, from my brief teaching experience, I moved into the core of development work, prioritising community-driven interventions in the health research and development spaces, coupled with supporting children and households made vulnerable by HIV/Aids/TB, mainly in Kenya and across several other African countries at Management levels.

I am also an actor in the Health Policy space within Maternal Child Health and Nutrition and Reproductive Health, having served in numerous National-level health-related technical working groups. These experiences have laid a strong foundation for my career trajectory, reflecting and learning every day and building into the specialist that I am today.

You are the recipient of several awards. Which one stands out the most for you?

(Rising up and carefully picking up one award from her trophy display.) This one is right here! It is the converted CEO’s award awarded to me by Global Communities in 2018. At that time, every two years, the CEO of the organisation would just decide whom to give the CEO Award of the Year. For the first time, the award came to Africa. I became the first African and first African Woman to win this award. It was and still is one of the greatest honours of my career life.

What was the motivation behind founding the Betty Adera Foundation?

I founded the foundation in 2017 because of two main things: I saw the need in the community and many people were coming to me with concerns about how to address Gender-based Violence (GBV), and secondly, due to my lived experiences. I took a step of faith and put together the initiative. So far, we have helped over 3,000 survivors of SGBV and GBV. Looking back, I wish I had started that foundation much earlier.

What are some of the lessons that you have picked along the way?

Being a woman in leadership is not easy. You have to work twice as hard to prove that you are capable of fulfilling your responsibilities. While this has been a challenge, I have learnt to be my cheerleader and a believer in my voice. That way, I can confidently defend my thoughts and what I believe in. I have also come to appreciate the power of being kind and giving back. I have come to learn that giving comes with so much satisfaction and blessings.

What does the future look like for you?

I hope to have my Doctorate thesis published and I would also like to author books going forward. I am currently 50 years old and I am soon going to be an empty nester, so I also have plans to take on superfoods farming and put up a mental wellness centre to respond to the unique needs of adolescents and young people.

What’s your favourite meal to eat and make?

I love ugali. I can have ugali with no accompaniment. When I travel outside Kenya, I tell my sons to make sure they have prepared ugali before coming to pick me up from the airport. Chapatis are my favourite to make and I make really good ones, though I am not a fan of eating them. Even when we go to the village for Christmas or a family gathering, cooking chapatis is always left to me. I am fast and I make a lot of them in an incredibly short time.

"Landslides, floods kill three and destroy property in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet","Two people died after being buried by landslides in Elgeyo Marakwet County while another was swept away by raging waters in West Pokot as floods caused by heavy rains.

The duo died while scores of others were injured after landslides hit Chesoi village in Marakwet East, damaging several houses and crops.

""The injured have been taken to hospital while rescue operations are ongoing to assess the extent of damage and losses suffered by families,"" said Oscar Okumu, Kenya Red Cross Society Head of North Rift Region.

In West Pokot County, one person was killed by floods while two schools were destroyed and 300 sheep lost after a landslide hit Chepkaram village in Tapach, Pokot South sub-County, damaging infrastructure, several roads and submerging several acres of food crops.

Kiamakeo Assistant Chief Michael Loreng said the body was found floating in the Chesra River on Thursday.

The body of a male adult, estimated to be around 60 years old, was recovered from the river and taken to the Kapenguria County Referral Hospital mortuary.

The floods also damaged Chepkalit Primary and Secondary Schools, casting doubt on their reopening on Monday.

""We were eagerly anticipating the reopening of school on Monday, but now our hopes have been dashed by this unforeseen calamity. Our classrooms are flooded and our learning materials have been destroyed,"" lamented Fred Ngolepus, a parent.

The reopening of schools, which had been eagerly awaited by both students and teachers, is now hanging in the balance as authorities scramble to assess the extent of the damage and devise a course of action to deal with the aftermath of the disaster.

West Pokot County Director of Education, Simon Wamae, expressed grave concern over the devastating impact of the floods on Chepkalit Secondary and Primary Schools.

He appealed for support to rebuild the damaged institutions to facilitate a smooth learning process.

""The school will not open because it has been badly destroyed by the floods,"" he said.

Mr Wamae called for concerted efforts to reduce future risks from natural disasters.

""Our priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our learners and staff. We are assessing the damage and implementing the recovery process,"" Mr Wamae said.

"Buffaloes, Rhinos face-off in Rugby Super Series second round","Kabras Sugar Buffaloes and Faiba Mobile Rhinos have rung changes in their squads ahead of their clash in the second round of the Rugby Super Series today at the Nakuru Athletic Club.

KCB Lions and Menengai Cream Cheetahs, who won their first-round matches, face off in the other second-round game at the same venue.

Favourite Buffaloes stunningly went down 18-5 to Cheetahs while Rhinos fell prey to the Lions, losing 29-7 in the first-round matches played last Saturday at RFUEA ground.

Head coach Max Adaka has made seven changes to the Buffaloes squad that lost to Cheetahs, bringing in hooker Geoffrey Shitambasi for Gibson Perez, second row Hillary Odhiambo for Jacktone Omondi and eighth man Gabriel Adero for Biden Hayo.

In the backline, scrum-half Collins Osore comes in for Dan Ang’wech, while Centres Darrel Brantana and Brian Kiptanui replace Alvin Mutach and Bede Enonda. Fullback Samwel Omollo comes in for James Olela.

Catholic University

“We had to give some playtime to some players, especially from Catholic University like hooker Jeremy Odhiambo and prop Emmanuel Otieno, who will start on the bench and eighth man Gabriel Adero, who will start,” said Adaka.

“We must win this match and the last one in Kakamega against the Lions to finish top or second for the final duel,” explained Adaka.

Rhinos deputy coach Oliver Callum, who has six changes to his squad, has roped in Kenya Under-20 scrum-half Patrick Wainaina but will start from the bench.



Callum has preferred Mohamed Khedir over Abel Matanda at prop, while second-row John Aswani and flanker Laban Kipsang’ come in for Stanslous Shikoli and Barnabas Owuor, respectively.

Arnold Muita replaces Ian Mumbwani, while Ervin Asena retains his fly-half position in the backline.

Hosts Cheetahs coach Lawrence Buyachi and his Lions counterpart Oliver Mang’eni have kept faith in the squads that won last Saturday, making minimal changes ahead of the “Cats” battle.

Kenya Simbas utility back row Elkeans Mukamiti comes in for Samuel Were, while Kenya Under-20 winger Alvin Khavoli replaces Samwel Macharia in Buyachi’s only changes.

Quinto Ongo moves from the right wing to fullback to accommodate Khavoli.

Mang’eni, who has brought in Patrick Ouko for Wilhite Mususi at prop, has put his trust in the likes of Barthes Trophy-winning captain Andy Cole Omollo, among others.

Lions top the standings with five points after their bonus-point victory against Rhinos. The Cheetahs are second with four points, while the Buffaloes and Rhinos are pointless in third and fourth places.

The Rugby Super Series received a significant boost on Wednesday when mobile phone service provider, Jamii Telecom (JTL) supported the event to the tune of Sh4 million.

From the package, Sh1.5 million is in cash, while the remaining Sh2.5 million will go towards branding as JTL took charge of the Rhinos. In addition, the company will provide internet connectivity during the Rugby Super Series.

The games will be played at the Nakuru Athletic Club. Tickets go for Sh500 for regular, Sh200 for parking and Sh2,000 for VIP (parking included).

 ,"Punished by the vagaries of weather, Daniel Wambugu and Jane Ndiritu abandoned crops in favour of poultry production. Their chicken business has attracted the attention of local and global organisations keen on agribusiness.

Started in 2018, Dheiton Ventures Ltd is becoming a resource centre and training ground for farmers in dry parts of Laikipia and Nyandarua counties.

“We have 15,000 layers but our target is 300,000 in five years. We have also contracted 200 small-scale farmers who have had basic poultry managerial training,” Wambugu says.

“Our bigger dream is adding value to eggs. Before that, we must be sure of sustained production. It is not okay to introduce a product and then fail customers.”

He adds that Dheiton Ventures’ customers are in Nairobi, Nakuru, Nyahururu, Isiolo and other towns. Wambugu is the company’s Enterprise Development Director.

Ms Ndiritu, the CEO, says they tried many crops on the 15 acres but failed.

“The rains would disappear, leading to losses. We had to change gears. We wanted a business that would provide education to locals who would use the skills to improve their lives. We had to take a risk,” she says.

Juan Echanove, CARE International USA Vice President, says such ventures are good for food security.

CARE International is an agency that helps improve agribusiness and nutrition.

Small-scale farmers

“The firm has shown that there are better ways of promoting the welfare of small-scale farmers. It is a good case of a healthy value chain. Care International can work with Dheiton for the benefit of smallholder farmers,” Echanove says.

“This farm has encouraged us to partner with the national and Nyandarua county authorities on the best methods of addressing food insecurity in dry regions. It is also promoting climate-smart farming.”

Apart from eggs, Dheiton Ventures also sells manure and live birds.

Before starting the poultry project, Wambugu and Ndiritu had tried a hand in tree tomato production. They abandoned the venture on realising it was not benefiting the community due to high water demand.

“We settled on poultry after doing some research locally and abroad. It involved visiting research institutions, successful farmers and experts,” Ndiritu says, adding that keeping chickens is not labour-intensive or time-consuming.

Every chicken house on the farm is capable of holding 5,000 layers.

Wambugu says they settled for layers because they are not as challenging to keep as broilers. He adds that eggs and the birds themselves have a guaranteed market and the turnaround is just six weeks.

“With layers, one has a steady income for about a year and a half. With time, a farmer can have a big network of buyers. We dispose of the layers every 24 months and restock. For now, we are offloading 15,000 layers to be left 5,000,” he says.

Read: Are you interested in chicken farming?

Every structure has a layers’ ward, where birds appearing sick or brooding are kept.

When it is hot, some birds develop signs of brooding but recover in two to three days when placed in the ward.

The disposed layers are normally replaced in just a month. Dheiton started with 8, 000 layers.

Workers at the farm monitor the layers from day one, to brooding, laying to the time they are exhausted and sold for slaughter. Dheiton Ltd specialises in ISA Brown layers.

Contract farming

CARE-Kenya Project Manager, Thomas Ongogo, says lack of a structured market has frustrated many farmers.

“Dheiton Ventures has addressed this through contract farming. Poultry production is not disruptive. One can rear chickens and still engage in other activities,” he says.

The farm buys day-old chicks and broods them for a month. They start laying eggs at 17 to 18 weeks.

Dr Teresiah Ndung’u, the County Livestock Director, advises poultry farmers to stick to best management practices and always consult experts.

Virginity: We're waiting until marriage despite peer pressure,"A few years ago, the value placed on virginity by society, especially on young women, was huge. Those who were not virgins as brides were pariahs. But as the world becomes liberal, so does our culture.

Few find joy in waiting. The average age of sex debut in Kenya now starts from 16, according to the latest Kenya Demographic and Health Survey report, with marriage starting at 21 years. Younger generations are now talking more openly about sex, be it with their peers or oversharing on social media. Late starters are ridiculed.

MyNetwork spoke to four young adults on their take on the value of virginity in modern society.

As a Muslim, I believe we should value virginity just the way our grandparents and great-grandparents did.

It was such an honour for a woman to keep herself until marriage. From a young age, I was taught the importance of staying pure until marriage and the benefits, which include earning a partner’s respect. I also believe that a couple is more likely to maintain a peaceful marriage if they know that their relationship started when they were virgins. They get to enjoy a special, memorable moment. It will be easier for them to remain faithful to each other. Young Muslims are always told not to engage in haram relationships, even if there is pressure to do so.

A couple was expected to lie on white bedding the night after the wedding. This was used to test for virginity.

However, things have changed. The excitement and anticipation that came whenever a woman got married, with in-laws waiting by the door to pick up the bedsheets the next morning after the honeymoon night to confirm that she was a virgin, is slowly fading away.

Read: When virginity is not a measure of morality

Currently, this practice is only upheld by old people. They seem to be the only ones who believe that one should remain a virgin until marriage. I am not sure if we should blame the elders for not teaching their children the importance of virginity or blame the younger generations for failing to uphold their parents’ values and principles.

Nowadays, adults who are virgins are considered immature or too conservative by their peers. This is especially the case for younger men. Some of them are eager to sleep with as many women as possible. There is a lot of pressure on young women to lose their virginity too.

I have also heard men say that they would never marry a virgin because they have no ‘experience’.

Some women brag on social media, boldly, about having had several men and flaunting the numbers as if it were an achievement. This peer pressure makes some feel left out, a sad reality.

As a young woman, I still hold my virginity in very high regard, perhaps because of my upbringing. I am incredibly conscious of the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.

Homa Bay is one of the counties leading in HIV/Aids infections and teen pregnancies, and I believe that some of the cases can be prevented through abstinence.

I would like to advise younger people to abstain until marriage. There is no honour in having an early sexual debut.

It only leads to guilt and remember, once you engage in sexual activities, stopping might not be easy.

Our elders should also place more emphasis on cultural teachings like the Madrassa classes for Muslims.

Abstinence can be challenging, but it is a choice one should make. Self-respect, sexual purity, and adhering to spiritual and cultural beliefs can greatly encourage youth to embrace abstinence.

However, I do not believe that virginity should be the primary reason for considering or rejecting a potential partner.

One of the things that will help encourage abstinence is for parents to have honest discussions about sexuality with their children.

This will uphold the values of purity, self-control, and the sanctity of the marital bond.

To date, people who manage to keep themselves until marriage are respected.

Abstinence is a sign of self-discipline and self-respect. The delayed gratification sets the stage for a more meaningful and fulfilling relationship.

Read: Why women need to openly talk about sex

But we all know that not everyone values virginity, and this is a sad truth.

The behaviour change has been influenced by societal influences, including exposure to media and a lack of comprehensive sex education from parents and other trusted sources.

This has come with harsh consequences. The results of early sexual acts include loss of self-respect, the risk of early pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases.

However, all is not lost. I believe that providing age-appropriate sex education to children is crucial. We need to let children know from an early age that their sexuality is important and that irresponsible choices could lead to diseases and even death.

This should be accompanied by open and honest discussions about the long-term benefits of abstinence.

I think our parents are the last generation to place a high value on sexual purity, especially for women. My generation views sex differently: as a way of spending free time.

My take is that virginity is not necessarily a measure of a happy marriage. I would prefer to connect intimately with my potential spouse before marriage.

I know that this was shunned and unheard of in the past, especially in my culture, where there are lots of taboos about premarital sex.

Intimacy was sacred. A virgin would attract a hefty bride price and bring honour to her home. Those who did not preserve their purity were seen as an embarrassment, and at times the family would disown them.

This went a long way in discouraging both boys and girls from premarital sex. There were very few cases of single parenthood or children born out of wedlock.

Read: I'll hold on to my virginity till marriage and I'm urging girls to remain pure as well

Currently, peer pressure, lack of adequate parental guidance, early and unlimited exposure to adult content and lack of timely sex education have made it hard for young people to practice abstinence.

This has led to an increase in cases of abortion, STIs, and single parenthood. You gain a lot by delaying your sexual life. Look at a growing generation of bitter young women who have been left to take care of their children single-handedly.

If we are not careful, our world will soon be full of broken relationships with confused children who do not even understand what is going on.

It is high time we started promoting comprehensive sex education. For me, I will engage my children in sex education as early as possible because I believe that an educated mind makes better decisions.

Consider the potential consequences of your actions and prioritise your physical and emotional well-being. Talk openly with trusted adults.

I blame society for watering down the value of virginity. People around us expect women to remain virgins until marriage, but men are not judged by the same standards.

If a man decides to sow wild oats, it is considered normal. That is where we all got it wrong. In a world where irresponsible sexual activities can cause deadly diseases, one needs to abstain until marriage.

I also believe that whoever can abstain from sexual activities until marriage, whether male or female, automatically earns respect.

As a woman, you earn so much respect and confidence, not just for yourself but also for your family. They will be revered for raising you well. The best part of getting married as a virgin is that even your husband will speak highly of you.

We are, however, in an era where young people are not interested in keeping their virginity.

Celibacy is unusual. Young people are looking for fun, and I dare say that is the reason they keep moving from one relationship to the next.

Peer pressure and easy access to mobile phones and the internet are other reasons for the moral decay of society.

Read: New York considers 'virginity test' ban after uproar

Parents often give their children phones but pay little or no attention to how the gadget is used, yet social media has no filters and does not care whether one is a child or an adult. Let us also not forget that young people are very curious and try out what they see.

Another major gap is the lack of sex education. Many adults are unwilling to tell the youth what they need to know and instead tell them what they want to hear. When they make mistakes, we start blaming them.

The result is that so many young adults are living with guilt. There are lots of broken relationships and homes.

To get back on track, sexual education is key. I attended many sexual education classes organised by a non-government organisation back in school. We were taught about the different types of STIs and how to avoid contracting them. The lessons helped me. I knew where to draw the line. I was able to say “no” whenever I needed to.

"Ivy Namu: I left my law studies and focused on content creation, for that is my passion","Ivy Namu, a content creator, burst into the spotlight four years ago amid rumours of a romantic relationship with media personality Willis Raburu. Before she became popular, Ivy says she cherished her private life as she could walk around and dress as she pleased. Today, she opens up about navigating stardom, reshaping her brand, and her decision to abandon a promising law career

1. As a public figure, what forms of cyberbullying have you ever experienced?Social media is not a very friendly space. In 2022 I was trolled for an outfit I had worn to the Wakanda film premiere. I had delivered my second child Yara just five months before that and I was so excited to go watch the movie and be out for a couple of hours. I dressed up like a good mum and felt good about myself. You know the lack of body positivity you get after giving birth…you feel chubby and all that. I made a reel and posted it on my TikTok. I then slept only to wake up and find myself trending on TikTok when I woke up. People were saying I was the worst dressed person for that occasion. I remember wondering what was wrong with my outfit because I felt fine in it.

I just switched off my comments and blocked some toxic people. It didn't get to me so much but I restricted any further reactions. There was also a challenge with my relationship at the time and at some point I felt like I needed to just quit the internet and be quiet. It took a while to fight back the negativity from people who didn't know me. I decided to focus on the positive side of things.

2.How did your life change when you started dating famous TV presenter Willis Raburu?To be honest, I was afraid to date Willis because his divorce was in the public domain. Again, I feel like God got back at me because I knew what I was getting myself into. I was prepared since the people who mattered to me knew my truth and I didn't need to defend myself, so I fell in love and the rest is history.I would say I have learnt the value of privacy. When you are not in public, you take for granted the fact that you can walk anywhere and do anything and nobody cares. I had to learn to be keen about everything I say on social media, what I post and even how I react because it is no longer about just me and my family anymore. Now, when I go somewhere and nobody takes a picture of me, that is a good day for me.

My privacy was compromised and even now I have had to consciously reduce the number of pictures I post with my children, even though I am very proud of them and I like posting pictures of them. I am always afraid that tweeps may attack. But that space has also allowed me to experience a lot of love and support from people I don't even know.

3..As a mother, you seem incredibly focused on maintaining your health and well-being. Can you share with us your approach to health and how it influences your role as a parent?Moving from feeding for two to being conscious about what I eat has been my main goal. I also exercise a lot. I have decided to become intentional about it because birthing and raising children is not an easy task. My second pregnancy is what puffed me up and I got to about 80 kilogrammes, from about 55kgs. I got to a point where people could not recognise me. Now, I keep introducing myself to people after pregnancy since I have lost so much weight. I am about 60kg and I aim to be healthy, although I am not so obsessed with cutting weight.

About motherhood, I am taking it day by day and I love it. Watching my children start school gives me confidence. The secret about this journey is to be kind on yourself. My children have taught me a lot as a mother. I have two children under two years and balancing between my career aspirations and time spent with them has been hard. I had to deal with a lot of mum guilt and I had to spend time with both.

4. You have mentioned singing, tell us about your music journey and why you quit your law studies…I am the first musician in our family. I used to sing in primary and high school. Most of my classmates thought I would become a musician immediately but I decided to take law as a career to make my parents happy. I studied law at Catholic University of Eastern Africa so that I could be away from home. I did the course for three and a half years and I quit. I had scored a B plain in high school despite always being in trouble.

The course got overwhelming and I was always sad. At the time, I didn't know much about anxiety, but I was not okay. I decided to take a break at first for one year and then when I went back I felt like the course wasn't in my heart anymore. The main reason I was feeling that was because I didn't feel like I was doing what I wanted. After I quit, I went to music school and that is also where I started doing social media management and digital strategy. That is how I ended up at Royal Media Services.

The law studies have helped me navigate both the entertainment industry and the digital space. I am able to read my contracts and negotiate for better perks which the law affords me. I have been recording music and I will be releasing an album later this year. I sing contemporary RnB music about kindness and being good to people. I have also written love songs, and songs about the environment. I know I can sing well and I can't wait to share my talent with the world.

5.  Describe your dream wedding.Our wedding will happen but we might not post photos anywhere. It will be a very intimate affair with people I love and also, it will be an experience. My husband and I are an experience. We will have the best moments during our wedding. We will dance and entertain our guests. Close friends and family who stood by us when we were harshly discussed online will be given first priority. My engagement happened during my son's first birthday in July 2022. I had planned for the event only to be surprised. My best part was Nviiri singing and when I saw him, I knew Willis was going to propose because Mae Wendi is our song.

Ewaso Ng'iro River conservation efforts receive Sh10m boost,"The Dutch government has launched a partnership with community-based organisations in the Ewaso Ng'iro Basin to rehabilitate the degraded water source.

As part of the initiative, Water Resource Users Associations (WRUAs) and Community Forest Associations (CFAs) from Laikipia, Isiolo, Meru and Nyandarua counties have received a grant of Sh10 million to strengthen their conservation efforts.

The cheque was handed over by Dutch Deputy Ambassador Jolis Van Bommel to officials of the Mount Kenya Ewaso Water Partnership (MKWEP) at the Laikipia Governor's office in Nanyuki town.

World Wildlife Fund

The money, channelled through the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), will address governance and financial challenges that have rendered most of the 30 registered WRUAs in the region inactive.

WRUAs and CFAs are community-based legal entities recognised by the government to conserve water catchments and protect water sources.

However, they have not been able to adequately fulfil their mandates and, despite their existence, human activities such as encroachment and illegal water abstraction continue.

WRUA national chairperson Julius Kiriinya said the funds would, among other things, support the deployment of conservation scouts, noting that government agencies have failed to enforce existing laws enacted to protect water sources.

""We continue to witness massive encroachment on riparian areas in the Ewaso Ngíro Basin, such as farming, construction of structures and establishment of car garages, all of which have a negative impact on the flow of the river,"" Mr Kiriinya said.

The WRUA official noted that more than 100 rivers in the country have dried up in the last 40 years and if harmful human activities are not curbed and people continue to blame climate change, it will be a matter of time before the remaining 66 rivers also dry up.

In recent years, there has been massive lobbying for the conservation of the Ewaso Ng'iro River, the main source of water in semi-arid northern Kenya, which is fed by tributaries from the Mt Kenya and Aberdare forests.

Floods from Uganda displacing families in Turkana,"For more than two decades, Agnes Akuwom, 45, and her husband John Kebo, 51, have called Tobong’u Loree village home.

The couple has sired eight children with the firstborn daughter already married with two children.

Their home though 100 meters from the banks of seasonal Kawalase River that draws most of its water from slopes of hills and mountains in neighbouring Uganda’s Karamoja region, has never flooded to such a point that they have had to move out.

“We have always relocated to higher ground at Nataparikakono primary school and return after water levels subside. However, on Saturday at around noon, Lodwar town and its environs had not experienced rainfall for two days but floods from the river swallowed up several houses including ours,” Ms Akuwom narrated.

The floodwater that was more than five feet deep submerged more than 100 houses. Villagers who had been on high alert salvaged some of their property.

“Usually, the water level would be no more than two feet high and would subside just after two hours, but it appears that the river flooded at night after the heavy rain,” she added.

The couple, together with other 197 families, occupy a camp established by the Kenya Red Cross (KRS) and the Turkana County government at an unoccupied rehabilitation and counselling centre for people affected by alcohol and drug abuse in Nataparikakono village.

The Nation team found her mid-Sunday morning preparing black tea for her family outside her tent as she waited for relief food to be trucked in.

“As a family, we have decided to relocate from our ancestral home where my parents were buried. I plead with the government to get us a sizeable land where we can rebuild our lives because going back will be a death sentence for us,” Mr Kebo said.

He said they are tired of moving in with relatives and/or friends whenever the river gets flooded but this time round they resolved not to.

“At the camp, we were counselled by Kenya Red Cross staff over our decision and even though we don’t have a reliable source of food or even mosquito nets, we were assured of support with time,” Mr Kebo added.

The Nation also found Asha Ajikon who has decided never to return to her ancestral home. He weaves together a patchwork of cement bags to forge an additional tent for her temporary structure that has to accommodate her family and all her belongings.

Deputy Governor John Erus confirmed that three people have died as a result of floods across the county, 1,381 livestock lost and over 1,400 people displaced.

“We have identified three potential sites in the county where with support from the national government and development partners we intend to relocate all people affected by floods after proper verification,” Dr Erus said.

He warned residents against returning to their marooned homes as they lie on a riparian zone - near seasonal rivers Kawalase and Tarach as well as Turkwel River that will definitely flood in case Turkwel Hydroelectric Dam fills up.

“We will ensure that the displaced people get access to basic health services through mobile medical outreaches, dignity kits, water through our trucks, and their children get playing and educational materials,” Dr Erus said.

Turkana County Government has provided 100 bags of maize and 20 cartons of vegetable oil (100 litres apiece) to the affected households.

In addition to the food distribution at Nataparkakono village, the County Government through the Directorate of Disaster Risk Management has been conducting daily assessments across the high-risk 156 villages.

The County Government is working with Welthungerhilfe and Unicef through the KRS to support displaced households with non-food items in Nataparkakono, Lokangae, Todonya’ng, Kerio Delta, and Kalapata.

Lodwar Township MCA Ruth Kuya called on the County Government to provide all victims of the flooding with food and appoint health officers to attend to them to reduce potential health hazards. She also urged the community to use the provided toilets to minimise the risks of cholera through contamination.

Kenya Red Cross Society Coordinator for Turkana County, Rukia Abubakar emphasised the need for continued joint assessment and community sensitisation on risks associated with floods.

 ,"Nine months into the marriage, Lucy missed her periods. It was an exciting time for all of us. During her wedding, a hater in the name of her auntie had expressed doubts over her ability to conceive.

Coming from a village where girls rarely sought higher education, her undoing was that she had been in school for too long. All her age mates were already married and had children.

“She has swallowed all the pills and done all the abortions”, her auntie said sarcastically, “her womb is rotten.”

You see, several girls get pregnant and fall out of school so often that this has become the norm in some communities.

Others conceive while in college and by the time they finish their courses, they have a certificate and a baby.

Lucy, on the other hand, committed to finishing college, getting a job and only marrying thereafter. She believed that the baby should follow after the wedding.

She made a personal choice to follow this tortuous road. She finished her course at the university and started the difficult road of job-searching.

She got a job two years later after a series of attachments and volunteer work in a number of organisations.

It was only after that that she accepted to settle down. She had dated Erick for over seven years and made him understand her desire to live a systematic life. Erick let her have her way and, in fact, supported her through the journey. By the time the wedding came, she was 29.

“I know what your auntie and others of her kind have said but I love you for the kind of person you are – decisive and forward-looking,” Erick reassured her.

But as it happens, when you are described by people in a certain way, over time it sticks in the heart and the mind and you begin to believe them. You begin to question yourself and it falsely occurs to you that the majority cannot be wrong.

Read: Health Matters: Sleep your way to a better sex life

“When I failed to conceive on the first, second, third and even fourth month, I got anxious and I began to believe that there was a problem with me,” Lucy recounts, “If anything almost all of my peers had children.”

It is in the fourth month that Lucy therefore decided to seek medical help.

In taking her medical history, I found no health problems that could have caused infertility. I examined her and found all her body systems to be normal. I concluded that she was healthy and advised her to have sex two to three times a week and wait for eight more months for conception.

Conventionally, the definition of infertility is failure to conceive within twelve months despite having unprotected sex two to three times a week.

Two months after reviewing Lucy, I got a call from a doctor's colleague. Lucy was in his office seeking infertility treatment.

“She is anxious and is requesting for fertility pills,” the doctor said. “She is threatening that if we cannot help her situation, she will fly to another country for help.”

We decided to refer Lucy to a counsellor. The delay in conceiving was really getting on her nerves.

She spent most of her seventh month in marriage undergoing counselling.

“My once jolly wife is no longer happy,” Erick reported in one of the phone calls. “She is missing meals and her weight has gone down. She breaks down and cries easily at anything.”

Lucy dragged through the eighth month. I began to wonder whether she had a point.

Was one year actually not too long to wait for a pregnancy? I wondered whether we needed to break the rules of medicine and just diagnose her with infertility. I was crossing my fingers by the day, hoping to hear a different story from her. I was becoming part of Lucy’s anxiety and feeling pressured to do something.

“I will not break the rules, I will stick to the guidelines, yes, it will be fine,” I found myself mumbling as I walked to the office one morning, not sure that I believed my own words.

It was the beginning of Lucy’s ninth month in marriage and the pressure was building from all over the place. I started to imagine that the 12 months would soon be over and Lucy would remind me that she knew better and we failed to listen to her.

And so, it was a great relief when the pregnancy test turned positive on that Monday morning.

Read: The secrets about sex after 40

“So you have proved that science is right and we should follow it,” Lucy reminded me. “It happened within the 12-month window!”

“Even if you are busy, we must just have lunch today,” Erick added. “We can carry it to your office if that is what works for you.”

As we enjoyed the three-course lunch together, I remembered the words of my professor in medical school: that as much as one act of sex can lead to pregnancy, as many acts of sex can fail to cause pregnancy for a whole year, and that pregnancy happens when it happens and when it is least expected and unplanned.

In fact, said the professor, many of us came as accidents.

How Kuscco top bosses siphoned Sh580m annually,"Top executives of Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (Kuscco) siphoned Sh587.6 million annually over a decade, in a series of transactions including transferring money to their own accounts and tapping unsupported loans, plunging members into multi-billion shillings loss.

A government-backed special audit on Kuscco has revealed the executives rode on weak internal management structure to manipulate books of accounts and carry out the irregular transactions that cumulatively cost the society over Sh6.56 billion between February 2013 and April 2024.



Audit and advisory firm Grant Thornton, which scrutinised Kuscco’s books, has disclosed misappropriation of members’ funds through illegal withdrawals, cash transfers and engagement in illegal or unlicensed activities, ostensibly steered by top officials.

Kuscco was registered in 1973 as an umbrella lobby institution for Saccos, before morphing into an unregulated deposit-taking operation with different subsidiaries including Kuscco Mutual Assurance and Kuscco Housing.

Currently, Kuscco has a membership of about 4,168 Saccos, and holds deposits estimated at Sh18.9 billion.

Cooperatives and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui said on Monday he had dismissed Kuscco’s entire board and pledged to recover the lost billions in fresh efforts to save the struggling firm.

“Preliminary findings indicate systemic deficiencies in the management of resources, including the creative and unreliable financial records,” Mr Chelugui told reporters during a media briefing at his office yesterday.

“We will pursue all those culpable, all those that are involved, those who will be mentioned, until we recover every shilling owed to Kuscco members.”

The special audit was ordered by the ministry in January this year, after it was established that Kuscco’s books had been audited by unlicensed entities for the last two years, the period when it came under financial distress.



The ministry had ordered an inquiry into the activities of Kuscco by the Commissioner of Cooperatives in October last year, on suspicion that it had been engaging in illegal deposit-taking business, sparked by its inability to meet its financial obligations.

Initial findings had revealed that Kuscco had been commingling union funds between different programmes, including housing and insurance, without clear terms, and consequently was not able to release member deposits.

The Grant Thornton audit has shown there were high cash withdrawals of Sh5.47 billion between February 2013 and April 2024, which averages Sh40.79 million monthly. The auditor termed the cash withdrawal “out of character”, suggesting they were irregular and abnormal.

This included suspicious transfers worth Sh318.16 million that were made to the company secretary of Kuscco Housing.

Senior Kuscco staff and directors tapped loans amounting to Sh61.5 million, with Sh50 million going to the group managing director, Sh7 million to the head of Kuscco Housing Co-operative and Sh4.5 million directed to the company secretary of Kuscco Housing Society.

The audit further showed there were cash transfers to the personal accounts of three executives, with one top manager receiving Sh67.04 million, with two of his assistants getting Sh118.05 million and Sh15.99 million respectively.

In mid-January, Kuscco, without giving reasons, announced it had parted ways with its long serving chairman George Magutu and group managing director George Ototo.

Grant Thornton scrutiny also revealed that there was a double purchase of the same land at Sh80.55 million. There was also a Sh434.16 million suspicious cash transfer to insurance agencies.

According to Mr Chelugui, the irregular cash transfers to unnamed insurance agencies were “purported to be payment of commissions for services rendered to insurance services.”

Kuscco officials have also been found to have moved money between subsidiaries without following procedure.

According to the audit, Kuscco opened and operated a Fosa-Kusasa, which was neither a registered Fosa nor a microfinance. The officials rode on Kusasa to open an irregular account under Kuscco CIF, where customers’ cheques were received, endorsed and deposited at the Kuscco account for clearing.

Mr Chelugui said yesterday despite Kuscco incurring losses, it proceeded to declare bonuses, dividends and interests to members against the industry practice that only allows for such when an entity posts profits.

He said in light of the “egregious lapses” discovered after the audit, a consultative meeting convened on April 25, 2024 with representatives from depositors reached a unanimous decision to dismiss Kuscco’s entire board.

“It was concluded that the current board of directors has failed in its duty to steer the union effectively. Consequently, in the interest of ensuring accountability and restoring confidence, the ministry has taken a decisive action on this matter,” said Mr Chelugui.

He has directed the Commissioner for Cooperative Development to appoint an interim board of 15 members from affiliate cooperative, to oversee the “transformation and rehabilitation” of the union.

According to the ministry, Kuscco is registered as a lobby group for Saccos in Kenya, but is not in itself licensed to engage in the business of taking deposits and giving loans.

 ,"Napetet village, on the outskirts of Lodwar town, is being swallowed by the widening seasonal River Kawalase.

Local leaders have cautioned that houses located 300 metres from the banks of the river are all at risk of being swallowed by the widening river, pointing out thatLodwar Airstrip, Lodwar County and Referral Hospital, Lodwar Primary School, and populous Napetet village will also be destroyed if reliable gabions are not built.

Before a bridge was constructed on the 100-metre-wide seasonal river along the Lodwar-Kakuma road, several vehicles were swept by floodwaters, killing dozens of motorists.

Much attention was put on addressing disruptions of transport activities because, on some occasions, passengers would spend more than three nights before flood waters subsided.

Because of this, traders in fresh farm produce and fish from Lake Turkana counted losses whenever the flooding problem occurred.

The perennial flooding of the river, more than six feet deep, is still a ticking time bomb for residents of Napetet village.

Mr Mark Tukei, a resident, has stayed in the village for six years and constructed his permanent home and five rental houses that were earning him Sh45,000 per month.

His compound was initially 26 metres away from the banks of the river, where he had invested in gabions to divert the water.

“When the water levels rose above on Sunday, they completely washed away all the rental houses,"" Mr Tukei told Nation.Africa.

He learned of the incident through a call from neighbours who salvaged his vehicle.

""I have lost my poultry projects, kitchen gardens, goats and their shed, and three-quarters of my compound that also had a perimeter wall. I have relocated my family to safe grounds in town,"" Mr Tukei said.

Residents say besides losing more than 100 houses to the river, its average depth when dry may not accurately represent the current situation.

Attempts by the national government in 2016 to control flash floods from River Kawalase from submerging other densely populated villages such as Soweto and California also hit a snag after raging floodwaters destroyed a multimillion gabion launched by the then Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa.

Ms Christine Akusi, a resident, recalls that in 2018, her neighbour's semi-permanent house, built on a half-acre piece of land, was swept away.

She recalls shocking scenes where three bodies that had been buried within two months were exhumed from their graves and taken to the mortuary by relatives and Kenya Red Cross officials.

""Sadly, our ancestral homes are being swallowed by the river, with others left without memories of their loved ones after their graves were completely swept away,"" Ms Akusi said.

In 2020, residents embarked on a community initiative to redirect the flow and save the village by clearing dense thickets of thorny trees.

""Besides destroying our homes, the river which has changed its channel occasionally sweeps away graves of our relatives,"" explained Ms Esther Korima, a resident.

She said despite calls from authorities for them to relocate to higher grounds, Napetet, Natambusio, Ipelu, Longech, Lodopua, Adipo, Najasikiria, Mission, Nawoi, and Nabute villages are their ancestral land, and so it is hard to vacate.

She notes that places they are asked to relocate to lack basic amenities such as water, health centres and schools.

Turkana Central Member of Parliament Joseph Namuar, who visited affected families and traders, observed that poor workmanship was to blame for the massive destruction and displacement.

Mr Namuar said that the authority was to construct gabions along the river to ensure it doesn't overflow.

""We want State investigative agencies to conduct an audit of work done and funds utilised by the authority for the financial year 2019/2020 and second allocation 2020/2021 to establish if the findings will be commensurate with the expected work paid and done. If not, I will raise the issue in Parliament,"" the legislator said.

He said that houses located 300 metres from the banks are all at risk of being swept away.

Remembering ‘Papa Lolo' hit composer-Mose Fan Fan- five years on,"For many fans, relatives and former colleagues of legendary Congolese guitarist Mose Fan Fan (Se Sengo), Friday was an important day as they marked the fifth anniversary of his death.

In Kenya where Mose collapsed and died in Nairobi on May 3, 2019, most of his fans will particularly remember him for his composition of the ever-popular Papa Lolo hit song. With no major live shows organised in his honour, most fans are expected to celebrate his music online.

Speaking to Saturday Nation earlier this week from London Ms Angelique Bliungwa Nsanga, Mose's widow said she still cherished his musical prowess and particularly applauded his Kenyan fans for the love of his music.

“Kenya remains an important part in his musical journey as it was not only where he passed on but one of his greatest songs Papa Lolo was liked most, "" she said.

Similarly, she said she would join his fans online to celebrate his music.

At the time of his death, he was on a production tour of Kenya, to produce some of his new and old songs. Notably, a remix of Dje melasi, which he composed while with the legendary TPOK Jazz band led by Franco Luambo Makiadi in 1973.

The song was a dedication to his Kinshasa-based partner -Sidonie Djemalas, with whom Mose also had a daughter.

Nairobi-based producer Tabu Osusa of Ketebel Music was in charge of Mose's last production which was to culminate with a visit to Arusha, Tanzania. This is where he had been scheduled to team up with veteran Dar-based Congolese singer Tshimanga Assosa for recordings of new songs.

To most of Mose’s East African fans, Tanzania is important as it was his first stopover from Zambia after relocating from DR Congo in the late 1970s.

It was from Tanzania that he relocated to the UK through Kenyan in the early 1980s after having performed with Dar groups like Orch Makassy.

Notably, he was able to play the solo guitar style similar to that of his former band leader Franco Luambo Makiadi.

After Mose’s departure from TP OK Jazz, it was Thierry Mantuika Kobi who replaced him as a stand-in guitarist for Franco during live shows. Mose’s death was a double blow to Rhumba fans as it came just two days before his former counterpart in TP OK Jazz Lutumba Simaro was due to be laid to rest in Kinshasa..

In Kenya, Mose’s fans will recall the Papa Lolo tour of 2016, when he toured Kenya alongside UK-based Tanzanian musician Saidi Kanda, singer Nzaya Nzayadio, Congolese guitarist and producer Fiston Lusambo and fellow guitarist Douglas Kibs. Kenyan saxophone player Ken Makokha of the Ulinzi Orchestra band fame was among those who accompanied them during this tour.

Soldiering on after death of Ohangla maestro Abenny Jachiga,"In total contrast to the drama that characterised his burial, activities at the home of the late Ohangla musician Abenny Jachiga in Kadiju village in Chiga, Kisumu East, have been dormant.

For close to four years now, his 28-year-old widow Belinda Aluoch says they have had to contend with the prevailing circumstances as she struggles to make ends meet after the life of the promising artist was nipped at the peak of his musical career.

“Even though the majority of Kenyans have forged ahead without the man remembered for his stimulating Ohangla love songs, the family is yet to adjust to the new norm,” she said as we settled for an interview at her Chiga home.

While listening to his ‘Mano Kasinde’ hit song might be reassuring to his ardent fans, the composition elicits some mixed reactions from the wife and her two young children.

“As a family, we were not given ample time to mourn and give him a befitting send-off as we would have expected,” said Ms Belinda when we caught up with her for the interview at her home.

Within a few hours after developing breathing complications at his home in Chiga on June 10, 2020, Jachiga whose real name is Bernard Obonyo succumbed to pneumonia after being admitted at St Jairus Hospital in Kisumu.

To contain the prevalence of Covid-19 pandemic at the time, the Ministry of Health and the Kisumu County government issued regulations that, among others, capped the number of mourners at 15 and stipulated that burial should be conducted within 48 hours.

However, in total disregard of the laid down regulations, thousands of his fans turned out in their numbers and demanded that the burial be postponed to give them time to give the musician a decent burial.

The day-long chaotic scene forced the police who were overwhelmed to fire gunshots and tear gas to disperse the crowd as strangers took over the casket.

The police were forced to bury 'Mano Kasinde' hit-maker in the dead of the night in an event witnessed by his younger brother Austin Omondi.

The next morning, the mother and the widow had to sit on the grave to plead with the mourners who stormed the home and threatened to exhume the body to accord him a befitting burial.

However, the unfortunate outcome wretched the emotions of the mother as she tried to come to terms with the loss of her sole breadwinner.

In a twist of fate, Monica Auma faced the same destiny after developing breathing complications and succumbed three days later, says Ms Belinda.

“She got badly affected and breathed her last on my hand, just after arriving at the home of one of the local religious leaders where she requested to be taken,"" recalled the teary Belinda.

In the spirit of keeping the legacy of her husband alive, Ms Belinda at some point attempted to engage in composing Ohangla music but could not move forward after failing to get resources to record her debut song.

""Even though I have some passion, I realised that I was not able to fund the same and I have given up on that,"" she said.

To make ends meet, Ms Belinda practices peasant farming and is also involved in selling second-hand clothes at the busy Kibuye market and her village market in Chiga.

""With the little that I get, I have been able to provide for my family and progressively do some finishing works in my house,"" says the mother of two.

While well-wishers assisted the family in completing the construction of the house after the death of Jachiga in 2020, some final touches are yet to be done.

She however appreciates that she is able to earn some royalties from her husband's songs through Safaricom's Skiza Tunes.

But the spirit of Jachiga could be rekindled through his last-born son who has developed some interest in taking over the father's mantle in the music industry.

Whenever his song hits the airwaves, the eight-year-old is able to sing along the lines of 'Mano Kasinde' song that catapulted Jachiga to fame.

The song enumerates how people lie when caught with their partners and when they are hanging out with their cousins.

Jachiga is also famed for other songs such as 'Penzi ni Kama Yai' and 'Mano Maraga Odagi' which became a hit when the Supreme Court nullified the election of former President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017.

"Monitor dams, enlighten Kenyans on safety","It is disheartening that the death toll from flood-related incidents is almost 200 in just a month, making it imperative for the government to proactively safeguard dams to prevent tragedies.

For example, on April 27, at least 48 lives were lost in a flash flood that destroyed homes in Maai Mahiu after a dam burst with residents reported missing. Proper maintenance and monitoring of dams is thus crucial.

The government should declare the flooding situation as a serious national disaster. The ongoing unpredictable heavy downpours and flooding countrywide have resulted in significant damage and tragic loss of life among citizens. Thus the urgency for the government to prioritise this issue to prevent more deaths and displacement.

Floods have paralysed business operations at the heart of the economy, particularly in Nairobi, where cases have surpassed 30. Some have been forced to shut down as floods made the premises inhabitable. The havoc has extended to JKIA, disrupting operations with huge economic losses.

It is imperative that the government invest in water harvesting plans during the rainy season and educate the public on how to effectively manage water resources during the dry season, particularly for irrigation.

Many Kenyans have been displaced with the Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura indicating that more than 130,000 people have been rendered homeless. The government should establish more rescue centres for the flood victims.

It is crucial that Kenyans be educated on the risks of residing near river banks, dams and waterways generally. For their safety, the authorities should relocate the vulnerable to higher ground.

In light of the current situation, it is essential that proactive measures be to protect the well-being of the displaced. That way, we can absolutely work towards preventing further tragedies and ensuring the security and well-being of Kenyans.

"Firm's cheaper, seamless solution to cross border pay services nightmare","While operating from the United Kingdom, entrepreneurs Ola Oyetayo and Anthony Oduu encountered challenges in sending money to their associates back in Africa; this impeded the growth of their business.

Most of the available cross-border payment service providers would charge high transaction fees that affected their profitability. These fees ranged between three and five per cent of the transaction value.

The available payment solutions were also very slow, as service providers had not specialised in offering cross border payment services, leaving the entrepreneurs in need of a quicker solution.

“In markets such as Nigeria and Kenya, businesses that transacted large amounts of money would have to wait up to 24 hours to receive payments, while in less advanced markets, this could go up to seven days,” noted Mr Oyetayo in an interview with Powering SMEs.

The entrepreneurs also discovered that businesses trading in key African currencies encountered strict foreign currency transaction limits, which limited their growth and access to international markets.

In 2017, while unwinding over a regular game of poker, the two friends resolved to create a solution dubbed Verto, that would simplify cross-border payments in emerging markets, particularly Africa.

They quit their jobs, then approached some venture capital investors to support them in bringing this new idea to life.

Some of the investors included Quona Capital, Accion, Middle East Venture Partners, P1 Ventures and TMT Investments. Leveraging on their backgrounds in technology and finance, they set out to work.

Cross-border payment services

“There was significant opportunity within core target markets in Africa which on average record transactions of about $4.1billion (Sh541.2 billion) annually,” noted Mr Oduu, co-founder of Verto.

The Business-to-Business payment service would target registered businesses that needed to collect, convert or send payments with either global offices, customers or those that handled multiple currencies in their operations.

It would incorporate multi-currency wallets to enable businesses to freely convert and send payments in up to 50 currencies including the Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan among others.

To achieve this, the company established partnerships with financial institutions in major trade markets across the globe, as well as those in Africa.

“We designed products that would specifically facilitate large value cross-border payments and foreign exchange for companies doing business in Africa,” stated Mr Oduu.

It is estimated that the African diaspora sends over $50 billion (Sh6.6 trillion) back home every year and loses up to $3 billion (Sh396 billion) in high foreign exchange rates and hidden fees when sending money back home.

With this in mind, the entrepreneurs’ market entry strategy was to deliver a solution to cross-border payment services at a much more subsidised rate.

“Between quarter one and quarter three of 2023, Kenyan banks made $151 million (Sh19.9 billion) out of foreign exchange transactions. We built our own unified payment network to cut out intermediary complexity and fees, settling up to five times faster than traditional methods,” noted Oduu.

They realised that challenging institutions that had been operating in the market for years was not going to be easy, and they had to do more than simply launch a good product to succeed.

Notable growth metrics

“Cross-border payment platforms are still new in the regions we target. It is challenging getting into a market where most businesses do 90 per cent of the payment processing with banks,” noted Mr Ola.

Getting regulatory approvals in some of the jurisdictions that they were looking to venture into was also a challenge, as was the volatility of currencies in these emerging markets.

“The fluctuation of currencies slows the business in various aspects in the market, and this being a recurring issue in Africa, we have had to constantly review our model to come up with a solution,” noted Ola.

It has now been seven years since the firm began its operations in Africa and Kevin Ng’ang’a, the country director of Verto Kenya, says that over time, they have managed to gain a better grasp on the market.

Some of the notable growth metrics include facilitation of large value cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions for more than 2000 companies doing business in Africa.

“We have facilitated payouts to more than 170 countries, settling international payments in 27 different currencies and domestic accounts in 5 currencies including the US dollar, Euro, Sterling Pound, Nigerian Naira and Kenyan Shilling,” said Ng’ang’a.

“Our revenues have grown up to four times, thanks to the clients acquired in these new markets,” posed Mr Ng’ang’a.

The firm, which currently employs more than 100 employees in the various markets it operates in, is looking to venture into more jurisdictions within Africa, so as to facilitate Intra-Africa cross border payments for businesses trading under the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) market.

“This move will not only spur cross-border trade, but potentially enable us to grow our revenues 13 times over, in Africa alone, by 2030,” noted Ng’ang’a.

Joe Biden jabs Donald Trump in election-year roast at correspondents' dinner,"Washington

US President Joe Biden delivered an election-year roast on Saturday night at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner as protesters outside criticized his support for Israel's war against Hamas.

Biden used the annual black-tie event to chide his Republican rival Donald Trump for immaturity, poke fun at his own advanced age and take on the Washington press corps.

""Yes, age is an issue. I'm a grown man, running against a 6-year-old,"" Biden joked.

Biden, 81, later added of former President Trump, 77: ""Age is the only thing we have in common. My vice president actually endorses me.""

Trump reacted to the event by calling it ""really bad"" in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn’t get much worse than this!"" he said.

Demonstrators holding banners outside the gathering at the Washington Hilton chanted about journalists' deaths in Gaza. Hundreds of protesters encouraged journalists to boycott the annual event and shouted down administration officials as they entered.

Biden avoided the large protests at the front of the hotel by arriving through a back entrance, where he was greeted by smaller groups of protesters calling for a ceasefire.

At the century-old event, often referred to as Washington's ""nerd prom,"" hundreds of journalists, politicians and celebrities rubbed elbows in a massive banquet hall. It often features friendly jabs from the president in a closing speech that takes aim at reporters and other guests in the audience.

Biden offered some advice to the press corps.

""I'm sincerely not asking you to take sides. I'm asking you to rise up to the seriousness of the moment. Move past the horse race numbers and the gotcha moments and the distractions, the sideshows that have come to dominate and sensationalize our politics, and focus on what's actually at stake,"" Biden said.

This year, the event was hosted by ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Colin Jost.

Grassroots movement CODEPINK marched to the venue from a nearby park. ""The United States media perpetuates anti-Palestinian narratives and ignores Israeli war crimes,"" the group said on its website.

A growing movement against the war in Gaza has dogged Biden this year including at a $250-per-ticket March fundraiser at New York's Radio City Music Hall that was disrupted by protesters.

Recently, that movement has expanded to college campuses in the U.S., signifying a growing revolt inside the Democratic base that Biden needs to defeat Trump, who is now the Republican frontrunner.

Kelly O'Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, declined to comment on security measures for the dinner.

""The safety and security of our protectees is the US Secret Service's top priority,"" said US Secret Service spokesperson Alexi Worley, who declined to comment further.

Israel's six-month old war against Hamas in Gaza, in response to the October 7 attack by the militant group in southern Israel, has killed more than 34,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say, and caused a humanitarian disaster for the enclave's more than 2 million inhabitants.

The Hamas attack killed 1,200 people in Israel, and led to 253 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

The White House Correspondents Association was founded in 1914 and has held a dinner nearly every year since 1921 to celebrate the reporters who cover the presidency and raise money for scholarships.

Take measures to curb food insecurity,"Food insecurity has affected the country in a big way, including the economy. Yet most Kenyans do not engage in agricultural practices.

Many prefer an urban lifestyle and abandon their farms, leaving them unplanted, yet they experience food shortages and strain a lot to buy foodstuffs daily.

Most people’s salaries do not adequately cater for all their needs as they pay rent, and school fees and cater for the basic needs of their families. For instance, some people from central Kenya have abandoned their farms causing great havoc to the country.

Since the climatic conditions favour the growing of various crops and the rearing of livestock, this is a huge loss to the country. Here, they grow coffee, tea, maize, vegetables and many other crops and practise dairy farming. On the other hand, western Kenya boasts a huge share of maize production.

If all the people in these regions put an effort into utilising their farms, they could contribute at least 70 per cent to fighting hunger and food shortage.

The government should support them with effective fertilisers, better irrigation schemes, seeds, post-harvest storage, marketing, access to credit and much more. With such support, even those who prefer urban over rural life and do not have a stable job should also stick in their home areas and embrace farming.

Counties to open new frontiers for renewable energy,"The future of Kenya’s energy development will depend on clean energy solutions that can improve the quality of life at community levels.

Therefore, involving county governments is key as the devolved units are responsible for certain functions in areas such as agriculture, health and early childhood education.

The 47 counties are in the best position to account for the appropriate levels for energy access to be extended into development planning.

The linking of energy access to service provision and the County Energy Plans (CEP) will result in a successful integration of the National Energy Plan (INEP) as adopted in the Energy Act (2019).

A peek into the direction the CEPs are taking is clear- Kenya’s future, if all goes as planned – is clean energy.

This realisation comes at a time when the Sustainable Energy Technical Assistance (SETA) is facilitating 16 counties to come up with their CEPs.

“Everything is anchored on renewables. That is the future,” explains Mr Jechonia Kitala, the SETA key expert.

“Our project is involving 16 counties and all of them are going green,” he explained.

Counties have a raft of proposals such as solar, mini-hydros, e-cooking, green biofuels, wind and geothermal. Further, sources like biogas are emerging as a solution in saving forests from destruction.

Meru is one of the counties leading in biogas installations. The biogas is used for cooking, lighting, heating and running machines, for example, chaff cutter.

“The opportunities are immense and we are happy that more and more households are embracing non-traditional sources of energy like biogas,” said Jean Paul Claude, head of SETA.

Kenya's energy space has been vibrant, targeting just energy transition and universal access to electricity by 2030. It is also envisaged that the country will attain the ambitious target of universal access to clean cooking by 2028 and achieve net zero target by 2050.

According to Isaac Kiva, the secretary, Renewable Energy Directorate at the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, the completion of the CEPs is critical as they form the core components of the Integrated National Energy Plan (INEP) as espoused in the Energy Act (2019).

The total funding for SETA was Sh565 million. The funding was mainly technical support. However, about 25 counties are yet to start their CEPs.

Mr Kiva challenged counties to commit resources to finalise their CEPs so that Kenya can have consolidated INEP for rollout. Council of Governors representative Rosemary Rop observed that there are many opportunities in non-tradition energies, renewable energy solutions and liquid biofuels. She said energy is a key enabler that supports diverse sectors such as agriculture, water, health, and nutrition among others.

Mr Kiva noted that the energy portfolio is expanding and now the national government is keen on e-mobility and e-cooking that will not only expand the energy eco-system but also offer opportunities for employment, investment and improved lifestyles.

Mr Dan Marangu, the director of Renewable Energy, Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, said the project is key as it sets the path for a strategic journey towards achieving Sustainable Energy for All by 2030.

“Ultimately, we are looking at universal access to clean, reliable and affordable energy,” he noted.

Ms Elizabeth Muchiri, the director of Global LPG Partnership, said only six per cent of rural Kenya uses liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) while the national average is 26 per cent.

“Though Kenya is among the countries with high LPG uses, a lot more needs to be done to stimulate uptake. We need regulations that support safety, affordability and accessibility. That is one of the efforts the County Energy Plans is strongly proposing going forward,” she explained.

Mr Martin Andersen, head of Infrastructure and Energy, European Delegation in Kenya, lauded the country for the robust green grid that is about 90 per cent renewable. “We are proud of Kenya, and we will support the country towards 100 per cent green grid,” said Mr Andersen.

He said there are other interesting emerging areas that the EU is keen on supporting Kenya like green hydrogen, which is set to create more jobs.

Mr Andersen reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to support Kenya’s “Green Resilient Electricity System” that will strengthen transmission and stimulate the development of green energy.

Mr Kiva noted that the time is ripe to review the energy policy and streamline it like a sessional paper to give it strong anchorage in law.

The last of Obuya's cricket trilogy calls time on his decorated career,"Whenever Kenya's Collins Obuya plays cricket, his performances remind fans why he is one of the country's finest exponents of the game.

And it is easy to see why.

An all-rounder, the 42-year-old bats right-handed and bowls leg spin. He shot to fame at the 2003 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Collins was one of Kenya's best performers in the tournament, helping the country reach the historic semi-finals for the first time.

His retirement from the national team last month closed a rosy chapter in Kenyan cricket as he was the last member of the legendary team, still playing competitive cricket.

Now, as then, he displays flashes of brilliance that made him one of the most revered all-rounders in the world.

After 23 years in the game, the 42-year-old called time on a decorated career that has seen him play 568 times for Kenya.

He has played club cricket in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and Uganda.

Yet when his elder brothers Kennedy and David introduced him to the sport in the ‘90s, he did not envisage himself playing for that long.

“I consider it a miracle that I have played for this long,” the all-rounder tells Nation Sport.

“I’m very grateful for that, and I thank God for keeping me fit all this long.”

The father of two now joins a long list of players who frequented the ICC Cricket World Cup when Kenya was a force to reckon with in the game but watched helplessly in recent years as the standards of the game deteriorated.

In an enthralling bronze medal match between Kenya and Uganda at the 13th African Games in Accra on March 23, Collins had a deep conviction that it was time he bowed out of international duty while still at the top.

Yet, it wasn't meant to end this way.

“Heading to Ghana, I had no plans to retire from the game but at some point (in the match between Kenya and Uganda), I felt that my body was struggling,” says the right-hand batsman and leg-spinner, who was still Kenya’s best player by a mile.

“I felt that it was time for me to retire.”

He smashed three half-centuries in the African Games – 58 runs off 47 balls against South Africa - and 68 runs off 30 balls against Ghana in the group stage.In the semi-finals against Zimbabwe, he posted 52 runs off 29 balls. Taking to the crease for his last innings as a batsman for Kenya, the veteran cricketer had hoped to give his fans a treat of his blazing boundaries and towering sixes one more time.

It didn’t happen.

Weighed down by age and tiring feet, the 42-year-old bowled out before getting any run. In cricket terms, Collins was dismissed for a duck, and Uganda beat Kenya by 106 runs.

But with several achievements to his name, that was not how he had planned to retire from the sport he loved.

Yet even a disastrous last innings of his international career wasn’t stopping him from popping the champagne on his national team retirement.

The guard of honour mounted by Kenya and Uganda players at the end of the match and a long applause from the spectators signalled that his remarkable career with the national team is one for the history books.

“I’m very proud of my performance,” the former Kenya captain said.

“I played for Kenya in the Under-19 ICC World Cup (1998 and 2000), the T20 World Cup (2007) and two editions of the One-Day International World Cup (2003 and 2011). I’m very grateful for that and I wish to thank everyone who supported me. I thank God for enabling me to play that long.”

The dangerous opening batsman still wants to play for his family’s team, Obuya Cricket Academy, for two more years, after which he will transition to coaching. The secret to his longevity in the game?

“The love and passion I have for cricket is what has kept me going for this long,” he says. “But those who know me well will tell you that I’m one person who trains very hard. Every morning, I hit the gym for about an hour, after which I bat, bowl, and field with the help of my coach. After all that, I joined my teammates in training. At home, I ensure that I eat well and have enough rest and sleep,” adds the player-cum-coach, stressing that he is a teetotaller.

A strong sense of personal discipline, the all-rounder says, has had a huge impact on his longevity in cricket.

“I have played under many coaches, who were also my teammates in the national team. I don’t think that would have been possible if I were not disciplined. Despite being people whom I played cricket with, I never disrespected them when they became my coaches,” says the towering cricketer.

The players he played with and ended up being his coaches in the national team are Thomas Odoyo, Steve Tikolo, his elder brother David, Martin Suji, current coach Lameck Onyango, and assistant coaches Peter Ong’ondo and Joseph Angara.

What was it like for him to play in a team coached by his brother David?

“The working relationship was good. I respected him as my coach, and he respected me in return as his player. Anytime I cost the team, he openly called me out,” says Collins.

Had Kennedy and David not introduced him to cricket, he would have tried his luck in football.

“I loved playing football in the estate. I had no specific position, but I had great potential,” offers the leg-spinner.

Kennedy and David learnt cricket at the Aga Khan Sports Club in Nairobi, located just a few yards from where their family lived.

Since Aga Khan Sports Club paid school fees for its players from humble backgrounds, Collins says their parents always encouraged them to take the sport seriously. Playing as a bowler, he became an integral part of the club’s cricket team. It was not long before his continued top performance for the club started taking him places.

He was part of the squad that represented Kenya in the 1998 and 2000 editions of the ICC Under-19 Men’s World Cup (ODI) held in South Africa and Sri Lanka (50 overs), respectively.

After making his senior debut for Kenya in 2001 against West Indies in an ODI match at the Sikh Union Club in Nairobi, the right-hand batsman represented the country in most subsequent tournaments.

Had he been faint-hearted, he would have called time on his cricket career ages ago.

While Collins’ top performance in the 2003 World Cup earned him a one-year contract with English countryside Warwickshire, he failed to make any impression at the club.

At Warwickshire, things became tougher for Collins when he was sidelined for five months with a knee injury. When he resumed playing, he continued to struggle with his bowling. Not even specialised training in Australia in 2005 under the legendary cricketer Terry Jenner helped things.

But since old habits die hard, Collins never gave up on reviving his cricket career. He elected to turn all his attention to perfecting his batting, and his star began to shine again. When Collins called time on his international career in Accra, he was still Kenya’s top batsman.

“There is no trick to it (his top batting). I just spend time on training, read the opposition’s game, and adjust accordingly,” he says of his impressive batting throughout the years.

He says being part of the revered Kenyan team in the 2003 World Cup and the experience he has gained from playing with different players in different generations have also been crucial to his top performance at an advanced age.

“Maurice Odumbe would share with me tips on how to be a top bowler,” he says of Kenya’s most talented cricketer who became his role model.

“Kennedy shared with me the tricks to apply to stay long on the crease and score big runs,” the former national team captain says.

“He (Odumbe) could bat, bowl, and spin so well. That motivated me to work hard and be like him. He helped me a lot with my spin bowling,” he recalls.

Collins pays tribute to his family, especially his wife Rachel, for supporting his career. “They have been supporting me in good and bad times. When I got the injury, they were there for me, they supported me to get back,” says the former Stray Lions Cricket Club, Sikh Union Club, and Ruaraka Cricket Club player.

“I want to thank her (Rachel) for being there for me and the family whenever I was not around. She was taking care of the kids, I thank and appreciate her in a big way,” added Collins, who also played for Weymouth Cricket Club (UK), Pirates Cricket Club (South Africa), Caboolture Cricket Club (Australia), Ceylon Lions Cricket Club and Tornado Bees Cricket Club in Uganda.

Until July last year, Collins still harboured the dream of playing in the prestigious India Premier League. But following his retirement from international duty, he has given up on that dream and hopes to achieve it through his 16-year-old son Troy.

“I will try and convince him to work hard and achieve that dream. He is coming up nicely,” says Collins. He has also introduced his young daughter Alma to cricket and wants to see her don the national team colours in future.

He plans to pursue ICC Coaching Course Level III Cricket Certification.

“I’m waiting for the opportunity to come up for me to improve my coaching career. I hope to coach different teams at different levels,” Collins, who has already undertaken Level I and II of the ICC coaching certifications, says.

“I not only want to coach them (Kenya) but I also want to take the team to the World Cup.”

With more time on his hands, he has also started playing golf for fun. Outside cricket, Collins loves reading books, swimming, and making friends.

Emphasise health education and disease prevention,"Since Independence, when the government promised to fight ignorance, disease and poverty, health has been on the radar of successive governments.

We have made huge strides in curative health services but that is not enough. A healthy nation is one that includes all aspects of what health actually is.

Health education is essential if people are to learn to live healthily and avoid diseases. Health education helps people to care about their own health and take part in organising health services and disease control programmes. It is the route to making people realise that health and healthcare services are basic human rights for mankind.

Community health workers should link health services to development. In primary prevention, which is the beginning of healthy living, education enables people to value good health and know about diseases and how to make use of organised health services.

The Maternal and Child Health Clinics (MCH) success has been through vigorous education and awareness creation. The road to health begins at the grass root.

Proper information motivates people to practise personal hygiene and healthy habits like using safe water, proper sanitation and proper waste management. Through health education, medical workers can easily understand what people want.

There will be proper communication to develop healthier lives. That will help the country to gain ground in health service delivery, especially in rural areas, enabling people to understand preventive health services.

They will value the different screening procedures. When citizens are well informed, they are able to recognise the symptoms and signs of important diseases that affect them daily.

Health education, when properly carried out, becomes a two-way process. It is not just medical staff telling people what to do. The people will help the medics to understand their situation, needs and demands. Culture and the environment are vital in boosting health services. Good communication will create rapport with the audience.

Sea wanderlust: Four-day vacation on a cruise ship,"At 6:22 am on a Monday, I stand outside my cabin in awe of the sunrise, watching it from the sea. The sun, fiery reddish and orange, sits on the water on the horizon.

The clouds, it is like watching a fiery red cotton candy move in the sky. The sea is changing too. Becoming calmer. The sea is turning blue, from the dark grey at night. Scary, if sailing through a storm.

I am inside a cruise ship, MSC Splendida, docking at Cape Town Cruise Terminal in South Africa.

It is day 5 of a South Africa vacation, perhaps the ultimate on my bucket list experience.

Since South Africa removed visa restrictions for Kenyan travellers, many holidaymakers are trooping there. Last year, Kenyan travellers to South Africa rose by 99 percent, compared to 2022, reaching 42,403 arrivals from January to December 2023, the Minister of Tourism, Patricia de Lille says.

Just like the thousands of Kenyans seeking off-the-beaten-path destinations, I sampled South Africa’s top attractions; I spent three nights on a cruise ship from Durban to Cape Town, dined in nine restaurants, rode a quad-bike on the Atlantis dunes stretching about 10 kilometres and watched Cape Town from atop Table Mountain, which makes you feel like you are the Biblical Moses on Mount Sinai.

Day 1:

I arrive at OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg at about 11 am ahead of a connecting flight to King Shaka Zulu International in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal where I will start my cruise ship journey. It is a smaller plane to Durban.

I am anxious about sleeping on water, on a cruise ship, but I reason that there are many other ways I could perish, and rough, choppy air or water may not be it. That is before turbulence starts shaking the plane. Nothing reminds us of our mortality quite like suddenly dropping a few metres mid-air, locked in the belly of an aeroplane.

I did not know I could grip an armrest so tight. But we land safely and head to Sun International’s Sibaya Lodge in KwaZulu Natal. Calmness sets in as soon as we arrived. The hotel resembles large thatched domes, built in an unspoilt location with lots of greenery, overlooking the ocean. It has a big casino, which has older women holidaymakers, at the slot machines. This looks like a good retirement pastime; travelling to different countries to sample their casinos.

Lunch is at a Portuguese restaurant within Sibaya Lodge, which has four restaurants to choose from.

Day 2

The drive from Sibaya Lodge to the Nelson Mandela Cruise Terminal takes about one hour. At 11:34 am, we arrive at the terminal.

MSC Splendida is standing at the dock. She is humongous. Beautiful. She is white. At full capacity, we are told, she holds about 4,000 passengers and 1,300 crew members.

The check-in is like at the airport, including a luggage limit of two suitcases not exceeding 23 kilos each. And if you are the kind that packs an iron box while travelling, the port security will confiscate it. There is a photo booth where an embarkation souvenir photo is taken, just before you board.

My room is on deck 10, Cabin 10021. It has a balcony and an ocean view. It is small and cosy. Has a big bed. Okay, a sizable bed. It does not feel crampy. The decor is minimalist.

After settling in, we grab a late lunch at 3pm at Pago Pago restaurant. It is laid back and so are the meals; pizzas, burgers, fried pork and French fries. At Pago Pago, there is no dress code. You are allowed to walk in casually dressed; in sandals, or shorts.

There are seven restaurants on this ship, including The Butcher’s Cut which serves high-end Angus beef and Bora Bora with a buffet stretching a few kilometres; meaning you will sit at a table and remember you may just need a croissant. You walk back through the tens of food stations and get lost.

After lunch, we start combing through every deck of the ship. Some decks are restricted unless you are a crew member or very moneyed and a member of the yacht club. The 333 metres-long ship has 17 decks. It is packed with amenities to craft a family vacation; from swimming pools, a theatre hall and a Formula 1 racing simulator, a Lego room, a casino, an amusement park, shops selling clothes and luxury jewellery, among others.

There are 19 bars and lounges in it, complete with Kenyan bartenders, who can shake up a very good Manhattan or a Skyfall [which has Hendrick’s gin, lime juice, blueberry liqueur and mint leaves]. To escape crowds, you sit on a cushy sofa listening to a pianist, oblivious to the choppy waters beneath the ship. There is also wine tasting with a sommelier on board.

At 5:34 pm, the ship intercom calls for a mandatory safety drill. The lifts are locked, and we must walk down the stairs. You must swipe your room card at a designated location to show that you attended the safety drill. A few minutes past 6pm, the ship starts sailing.

Dinner is at Villa Verde restaurant on Deck 6. Here, you dress up and sit at the table 30 minutes before serving. No wearing flip flops, tank tops, t-shirts or shorts. By 8 pm, we are at the door, some dressed up in high heels and dinner wear. We are ushered to our tables. Just like non-casual dining restaurants, the small-plated meals are timed and served with precision.

At 10:15 pm, there is a welcome party on Deck 14 and an after-party, with DJ Zee. Some of my colleagues go partying. I get seasickness and walk back to my room.

Sleeping in a room floating on water and staring into nothingness is ineffable. I open the door to the balcony and gaze patiently at the inert horizon. There is no moving object, no living thing that might rouse me from the nothingness, just grey water with huge rumbling tides. It is a bit scary. I start feeling queasy and sicker. I walk back to my small room, about 20 square metres big, take motion sickness pills and sleep. The night is calm.

Day 3

Walking through MSC Splendida, one of the largest ships to sail on African waters, is like roaming through a big shopping mall, with a seemingly endless number of amenities — water parks, multiple restaurants, theatre halls, one that sits 1,700 people, a nightclub, gym, spa, and library.

Because there are many activities on the ship [you get a daily programme of what to do], you may wake up surprised by the relative absence of crowds. After breakfast, worried that I may have overslept, and people disappeared from the ship [my mind overworks sometimes], I start walking deck to deck checking out if people are still on board and what they are doing least I miss out. I find small crowds of people doing body stretches and indoor cycling at the gym. Others are in a “sexy legs competition.” Hilarious. Some are playing mini golf. Others are watching live music while some are learning Latino dance.

Deck 15 seems to be a favourite for many guests. The many swimming pools are designed for different vibes and demographics. There is a DJ, a pool bar and lounge chairs, plentiful for sunbathers. Movida Bar, where you drink while staring at the sea, is also located on Deck 15. It is 11 am and Deck 15 is throbbing. This is where the party is. The music is loud, and so is the laughter. Alcohol is flowing. Families are in small pools, jacuzzi-like. Others are in the big pool.

I skip lunch because here good food is in plenty and almost round the clock, so you will overeat.

In the afternoon, the karaoke and sports bar is crowded and noisy as football lovers watch an Arsenal and Manchester United match.

Seeking a quiet space, I find the La Prua piano bar, a tranquil area with cushy sofas and a pianist. Guests are napping on the sofas as others chat in low tones, sipping wine. The library is also quiet. It is not your traditional library. There are no visible books. One passenger, deep in thought, is staring outside the round window. Hopefully, the rhythm of the water set his soul free.

Dinner is in another bourgeois restaurant, La Reggia. This too has a dress code. Not to worry, it is not a black-tie dress code. The food is very good. It is hard to imagine how they keep it so fresh.

Contrary to the belief that most passengers on cruise ships are old retirees, aboard this ship, there are young families and children, men and women in their 20s to 40s.

There was a solo guest, deaf and dumb. Disability has not stopped him from exploring.

The nightclub, Club33 Disco on the 16th deck, is proof that interest among younger generations and Africans who have never cruised is higher than ever.

At 10:30pm, the dance floor, with Amapiano songs playing, is full of young people. The DJ, another Kenyan working on the cruise ship plays Kenyan songs, but we soon realise Kenyan songs do not resonate with many on international dancefloors.

Day 4

What does a cruise ship engine room look like? I asked a friend who paid $60 (Sh7,800) for the tour.

“It is like standing in a science-fiction movie,” she says.

On this “behind the scenes” tour, you get to meet the captain, the five pilots and 10 engineers, and experience what goes on into steering a ship at sea.

Another exhilarating travel experience is finding a Kenyan on board and hearing their stories. At breakfast, we hear someone singing a Kikuyu song. We laugh out loud and call her. She studied pharmacy before ditching the profession because of low pay. She worked in Dubai at banquet hotels before moving to cruise ships. She has worked in Europe and now South Africa.

The crew live in another entire ecosystem within the ship, often below passenger decks. While they spend most of their time serving passengers, there are several areas on the lower decks designated for them to unwind. The facilities vary from ship to ship and include a restaurant, rooms, gym, and bar.

There is also a hospital. I got a flu and thought of seeing a doctor. Consultation is $180 (Sh23,400 at that time). I walked back, entered a lift, and pressed the button to Deck 6 where there is a bar with a casino. I pull a chair and wonder if they sell ""dawa"". George, the bartender laughs as I try to explain 'dawa' in English. Kenyans smell each other especially when in foreign waters. He hands me a cocktail to kick the flu. I don't ask for the ingredients. There is some camaraderie and trust that brews when Kenyans are away from home.

Getting back to your room on such a cruise ship needs mastery in map reading. For the umpteenth time, I get lost. Cabin 10021 seems so far, yet so near. The corridors are zigzaggy. The sea is choppy. The ship is rocking. I stagger. Not from the cocktail but the mild sways of the ship.

But it is not too wobbly unless you have drunk too much. It might be harder to steady yourself.

One of the biggest surprises on the cruise ship is the array of dining options. At midnight, I feel hungry. I walk back to Bora Bora restaurant for the freshly made pizza, and cookies. I am not the only one coming in for the midnight snack. Other guests are just from Club 33 Disco on the top deck.

Day 5

At 6:21 am, the sunrays burrow into the ocean horizon. The sunrise is breathtaking. The sea is so blue it is purple. Welcome to Cape Town Cruise Terminal is seen from afar. The crew stands waiting. Two ambulances and berthing service cars are there too. Other ships, but cargo, have docked at Cape Town port. MSC Splendida sails slowly.

Skyscrapers, most painted in platone colours; whites and light greys, are seen in front of Table Mountain. Cape Town has awakened. Cars are on the road just near the ocean.

At 9am, we disembark.

I feel an immaculate sense of balance. “Life is good,” the voice in my head says, this time without any cynicism.

Many Africans are yet to look to cruising as a high-value alternative to land travel. To woo African travellers, the MSC cruise line started 34, two to five-night sailings from Durban and Cape Town to Portuguese Island and Pomene Island in Mozambique, Walvis Bay in Namibia and Port Louis in Mauritius.

The cost? For instance, a six-day Christmas cruise on December 23 from Durban in South Africa to Pomene in Mozambique, back through Portuguese Island in the same country, aboard MSC Musica, for two people, costs about 50,000 rands (Sh347,609).

As South Africa seeks to grow its tourism number, it also courting thrill seekers.

We head out to Atlantis Dunes Quad biking, 45 kilometres from Cape Town city. Here, the view is unforgettable, and so is the experience of riding a quad bike on dunes.

Dinner is back in Cape Town, at the Bungalow Restaurant, which is a must-visit. I eat kingklip fillet paired with one of the best Sauvignon Blancs I have tasted.

Day 6

Going up Table Mountain in a cable car is a must-do in Cape Town. I walk on the stone mountain wondering if I will hear Biblical Moses’ voice echo from yonder. The unobstructed views of the sea and city below — justify the visit. We then head to StellenBosch for winetasting and lunch. Stellenbosch smells of acclaimed vintners and we found two; one at Morgenhof Estate and and another at Seven Sisters Vineyards, both women.

Day 7

Back to Kenya, with bottles of wines from boutique vineyards, of course, lots of memories and post-vacation depression.

Getting back to your room on such a cruise ship needs mastery in map reading. For the umpteenth time, I get lost. Cabin 10021 seems so far, yet so near. The corridors are zigzaggy. The sea is choppy. The ship is rocking. I stagger. Not from the cocktail but the mild sways of the ship.

But it is not too wobbly unless you have drunk too much. It might be harder to steady yourself.

One of the biggest surprises on the cruise ship is the array of dining options. At midnight, I feel hungry. I walk back to Bora Bora restaurant for the freshly made pizza, and cookies. I am not the only one coming in for the midnight snack. Other guests are just from Club 33 Disco on the top deck.

Day 5

At 6:21 am, the sunrays burrow into the ocean horizon. The sunrise is breathtaking. The sea is so blue it is purple. Welcome to Cape Town Cruise Terminal is seen from afar. The crew stands waiting. Two ambulances and berthing service cars are there too. Other ships, but cargo, have docked at Cape Town port. MSC Splendida sails slowly.

Skyscrapers, most painted in platone colours; whites and light greys, are seen in front of Table Mountain. Cape Town has awakened. Cars are on the road just near the ocean.

At 9am, we disembark.

I feel an immaculate sense of balance. “Life is good,” the voice in my head says, this time without any cynicism.

Many Africans are yet to look to cruising as a high-value alternative to land travel. To woo African travellers, the MSC cruise line started 34, two to five-night sailings from Durban and Cape Town to Portuguese Island and Pomene Island in Mozambique, Walvis Bay in Namibia and Port Louis in Mauritius.

The cost? For instance, a six-day Christmas cruise on December 23 from Durban in South Africa to Pomene in Mozambique, back through Portuguese Island in the same country, aboard MSC Musica, for two people, costs about 50,000 rands (Sh347,609).

As South Africa seeks to grow its tourism number, it also courting thrill seekers.

We head out to Atlantis Dunes Quad biking, 45 kilometres from Cape Town city. Here, the view is unforgettable, and so is the experience of riding a quad bike on dunes.

Dinner is back in Cape Town, at the Bungalow Restaurant, which is a must-visit. I eat kingklip fillet paired with one of the best Sauvignon Blancs I have tasted.

Day 6

Going up Table Mountain in a cable car is a must-do in Cape Town. I walk on the stone mountain wondering if I will hear Biblical Moses’ voice echo from yonder. The unobstructed views of the sea and city below — justify the visit. We then head to StellenBosch for winetasting and lunch. Stellenbosch smells of acclaimed vintners and we found two; one at Morgenhof Estate and and another at Seven Sisters Vineyards, both women.

Day 7

Back to Kenya, with bottles of wines from boutique vineyards, of course, lots of memories and post-vacation depression.

Plastic-free environment can beat climate change,"Kenya once emerged as a leader in the fight against plastic pollution after being among the first countries in East Africa to limit the use of single-use plastics. It also signed the Clean Seas initiative to rid waterways of plastic waste.

The main aim of banning plastic bottles was to save human and aquatic life. Researchers had warned that as plastic pollution increases in the country, Kenyans would suffer the related health complications. Despite pioneering the ban, however, we are still drowning in single-use plastic.

Kenya outlawed single-use of plastic bags in 2017 but there are still no laws requiring corporations that profit from single-use plastic bottles to clean up what they produce. Even today, plastic bags are circulated all over the country as if there is no information of its ban.

Kenyans should understand that the discarded PET bottles line roadsides and drainage ditches like confetti and swathes of rivers flow beneath floating canopies of the stuff. The deadly waste eventually ends up in lakes and oceans, causing dangerous pollution.

During the rainy season, this becomes dire as the plastic waste clogs drainage systems, contributing to massive flooding. To fight against the effects of climatic change, our environmental bodies should strengthen laws spelling out responsible plastic use and how to recycle used plastics for an effective and efficient health environment.

Citizens ought to embrace effective recycling of used plastics to ensure a clean environment. All should support the world leaders, who have pledged to stop the adverse effects of climatic change by 2030. Let us protect our planet, Earth.

Auditor General Gathungu raises alarm over expenditure in county stadiums,"Auditor General Nancy Gathungu has flagged the expenditure of millions of public funds in various sports projects by county governments.

In her report on County Government Executives for the financial year ending June 30, 2023, Ms Gathungu said it was impossible to prove value for money spent on most of the sports projects being undertaken by the devolved units.

She added that there was a violation of the law during the implementation of some of the projects, the contract prices for the construction of some of the facilities were unlawfully increased, and there was irregular payment of allowances to some of the players and officials.

Bukhungu Stadium (Kakamega), Masinde Muliro Stadium (Bungoma), Siaya Stadium, Raila Odinga Stadium (Homa Bay) and Mombasa County Stadium are among the facilities that have been flagged for the irregularities.

In the case of Bukhungu Stadium, Ms Gathungu noted that the value for money of more than Sh1 billion, which includes Sh175,950,266 paid to the contractor for the construction of the second phase of the arena cannot be proven.

The contract for the project was awarded on May 21, 2019, at a sum price of Sh2,927,721,199, with the completion date set for December 30, 2021.

But a physical inspection of the facility in October 2023 established that the project was only 45 percent complete, with the contractor not on site.

“In the circumstances, value for money on the expenditure of Sh1,059,870,800 incurred on the construction of Bukhungu Stadium could be confirmed,” said Ms Gathungu.

Bukhungu Stadium is among the venues earmarked for the 2024 Africa Nations Championship (Chan) in September.

The Ministry of Sports has since partnered with the Kakamega County government to have the facility ready for the competition.

While Siaya Stadium was to be constructed at the tune of Sh394,661,767, the latest audit on the facility revealed that the contract price had irregularly been increased by Sh129,567,506, with a second contractor unlawfully being brought on board.

The new contract price for the construction of the facility was thus Sh524,229,273. But the value for money of Sh425,038,687 already wired to the two contractors building the stadium could not be confirmed and the works were behind schedule.

“There was no evidence of recommendations by an evaluation committee for these variations contrary to Section 139(1) and (2) of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015,” stated the Auditor General.

The contract for the construction of Siaya Stadium was signed on August 30, 2018, with the works expected to be completed in December 2019.

The extended contract period lapsed in July 2023.

The pitch, main pavilion, terraces, amphitheater, installations of the electrical fittings, plumbing fittings, and the roof are the works, which were still pending as of September 2023.

The audit revealed that the contractor building the Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi had been overpaid.

The construction of the stadium was expected to take two years from June 14, 2019.But despite only 70 percent of work having been done as of September 2023, Bungoma County government had paid the contractor Sh582,849,313 or 86 percent of the contract price.

The total cost of the contract was Sh679,386,376.

“No explanation was provided on the overpayment against actual works done,” stated Ms Gathungu.

“It was also observed that the actual payments of Sh582, 849, 313 included Sh40,200,000 paid to preliminary expenses, which were not supported. The expenditure of Sh582,849,313 also included Sh10,000,000 paid as contingencies but was not supported by appraisal of work done.”

The auditor general further revealed that roofing works for the facility were subcontracted to another contractor to the tune of Sh96,822,150.

However, the subcontracting agreement between the main contractor and the sub-contractor was not provided for audit.

In the case of Raila Odinga Stadium, the auditor general noted: “The regularity and value for money on the expenditure Sh49,678,406 incurred on the project could not be confirmed.”

Ms Gathungu said that the accounting officer for the Mombasa County Stadium project irregularly suspended its contract, with completed works to the tune of Sh619,782,152 or approximately 35 percent.

The contract for the proposed development of Mombasa County Stadium to the tune of Sh1,768,183,999 was signed on December 21, 2018, with the completion date set for January 6, 2022.

The completion date was extended by 65 weeks to May 6, 2022.

The auditor general said that the suspension of the contract on April 15, 2022, was not proposed by the contract implementation team as required by law – “since it had not been appointed and was done before the end of extended completion date.”

She warned that the “project is exposed to risks of cost escalation and project termination.”

Ms Gathungu also said it was not possible to confirm the distribution of sports equipment and items worth Sh97, 120,233 by the Department of Gender, Youth, Sports, Culture and Tourism in Trans Nzoia county government.

This was because the “department did not have in place approved guidelines and procedures on the identification of beneficiaries, establishment of a distribution approach and system, determination and formation of distribution teams, pre-distribution reporting and post-distribution monitoring.”

In the other expenditure that has raised eyebrows the auditor general said payment of Sh12,730,000 to players, team managers, and coaches who represented Kiambu County in the ninth edition of the Kicosca games in Kisumu County in January 2023 could not be confirmed since the payments were not supported by any document including certificate of participation in the Kicosca or evidence of registration of teams and players.

"Iran launches retaliatory attack on Israel with hundreds of drones, missiles","Jerusalem,

Iran launched a swarm of explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel late on Saturday in its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, risking a major escalation as the United States pledged ""ironclad"" backing for Israel.

Sirens wailed and Reuters journalists in Israel said they heard distant heavy thuds and bangs from what local media called aerial interceptions of explosive drones. Authorities said a 7-year-old girl was critically injured.

Israel's military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Iran launched dozens of ground-to-ground missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted outside Israeli borders. They included more than 10 cruise missiles, he said.

The Iranian salvo amounted to more than 200 drones and missiles so far, Hagari said, and had caused light damage to one Israeli military facility.

The Israeli military said later that it was not advising any residents to prepare to take shelter, revising an earlier alert in what appeared to signal the end of the threat.

Israel's Channel 12 TV cited an unnamed Israeli official as saying there would be a ""significant response"" to the attack.

Iran had vowed retaliation for what it called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on April 1 that killed seven Guards officers including two senior commanders and said its strike was a punishment for ""Israeli crimes"". Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the consulate attack.

""Should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe,"" the Iranian mission to the United Nations said, warning the U.S. to ""stay away"". However, it also said Iran now ""deemed the matter concluded"".

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Iran's attack, saying he was ""deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation.""

The UN Security Council aims to meet at 4 pm ET (2000 GMT) on Sunday, a diplomat said on condition of anonymity, after Israel requested it condemn Iran's attack and designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organisation.

Read: Three sons of Hamas leader Haniyeh killed in Israeli airstrike

US President Joe Biden, who on Friday had warned Iran against an attack, cut short a weekend visit to his home state of Delaware. Hereturned to Washington and met national security advisers, including his secretaries of defence and state, in the White House Situation Room. He pledged to stand with Israel.

""Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,"" he said on X after the meeting.

The Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, now in its seventh month, has ratcheted up tensions in the region, spreading to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawing long-range fire at Israeli targets from as far away as Yemen and Iraq.

British maritime security company Ambrey said in a statement that drones were also reportedly launched against Israel by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group.

Those clashes now threaten to morph into a direct open conflict pitting Iran and its regional allies against Israel and its main supporter, the United States. Regional power Egypt urged ""utmost restraint"".

While Israel and Iran have been bitter foes for decades, their long feud has mostly unfolded via proxy forces or by targeting each other's forces operating in third countries.

U.S. and British warplanes were involved in shooting down some Israel-bound drones over the Iraq-Syria border area, Channel 12 reported. Two U.S. officials said the U.S. military had shot down dozens of drone aircraft headed for Israel.



ESCALATION

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose official jet took off shortly after the attack began, convened the war cabinet at a military headquarters in Tel Aviv, his office said.

Israel and Lebanon said they were closing their airspace on Saturday night. Jordan, which lies between Iran and Israel, had readied air defences to intercept any drone or missile that violated its territory, two regional security sources said.

Residents in several Jordanian cities said they heard heavy aerial activity.

Syria, an ally of Iran, said it was putting its ground-to-air defence systems around the capital and major bases on high alert, army sources there said.

The European Union, Britain, France, Mexico, Czechia, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands all condemned Iran's attack.

Israel had been bracing for an Iranian response to the Damascus consulate strike since last week, when Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel ""must be punished and shall be"" for an operation he called equivalent to one on Iranian soil.

Iran's main ally in the region, the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah that has been exchanging fire with Israel since the Gaza war began on October 7, said early on Sunday it had fired rockets at an Israeli base.

 ,"Sporadic incidents of tension, mayhem and chaos involving unknown goons have been reported in Keroka town since the advent of devolution, the latest being on April 11.

So, what could be the reason behind such incidents in a town originally dominated by a single community – the Abagusii?

Here is an explainer.

The tension comes from a boundary dispute that has now escalated to an Appeal Court in Kisumu.

In the dispute is the emotive issue of double-taxation of market traders concerning rents, rates, licenses and other statutory deductions.

A three-judge bench composed of Justices Hannah Okwengu, Ali-Aroni and Joel Ngugi is currently reviewing the matter after the Kisii County Government appealed the decision of an Environment and Lands Court at Nyamira that had initially determined the matter.

Also, the dispute could be linked to political supremacy battles between Kisii County Governor Simba Arati and his Nyamira counterpart Amos Nyaribo.

Arati is the National Deputy Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement party. He has maintained that Kisii and Nyamira are composed of one Abagusii community that is under the control of the Raila Odinga-led Orange party.

On the other hand, Governor Nyaribo is the party leader of the relatively new United Progressive Alliance party.

The party, Mr Nyaribo argues, is the home of the Omogusii after the dissolution of the Simeon Nyachae-led Ford People Party in 2016.

UPA has a majority of MCAs in the Nyamira County Assembly.

Rigoma Ward MCA and journalist Nyambega Gisesa is the national chairman of the UPA.

It was Mr Gisesa who, in May 2023, petitioned the National Lands Commission, the Independent Electoral And Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the Kisii County Government, and the Ministry of Lands over the unresolved boundary dispute in Keroka - leading to the Environment and Lands Court ruling.

The conflict has led to an alleged loss of a boda boda shed worth Sh700,000 at Ichuni junction, Sh2 million worth of a public toilet and van, stalls and stock belonging to small business traders.

The Nyamira County Government claims more than 90 per cent of the town, and Kisi County wants a share of parts of the centre, asserting that the trading centre has expanded from the small market centre that it was into its territory.

Accordingly, Kisii County is claiming ownership of more than 50 per cent of the town.

On the other hand, the Nyamira County Government, in January 2024, changed Keroka into a municipality due to what the county assembly found to be its steady growth over the years.

This was done as per the Urban Areas and Cities Act 2011, when it was established that Keroka had a population of 107,922 people, far beyond the 50,000 threshold.

While signing the municipality approval documents, Nyaribo directed that the municipality have its headquarters at Rigoma.

Keroka Municipality is the second largest in the entire Gusii Nation (Kisii and Nyamira counties) - larger than even Nyamira town itself – which serves as the county headquarters.

The name Keroka emanated from the name of a shrub – emeroka - that surrounded the town.

Formerly Keroka Market Centre, Keroka lies along the busy Kisii-Sotik-Nairobi Highway and on the border of present-day Kisii-Nyamira counties.

The market emerged as an agricultural town but has witnessed steady growth over the years, attracting non-native traders.

Nyamira District, present-day Nyamira County, was hived off from Kisii District and established under Section 6 of the Districts and Provinces Act.

Keroka town was established as an Urban Council in 1979 courtesy of then-area Member of Parliament John Andrew Omanga.

It became a town council in 1997.

Some parties in the court dispute claim that the town council’s mayor during that time was from Ichuni ward, which is part of Kisii County, and jurisdiction was entirely with the former Kisii District, present-day Kisii County.

Kisii County argues that Ichuni Ward is demarcated by EBC as entirely falling within its territory.

IEBC's allocation of Keroka Farmers Union and Keroka Bus Park polling stations is the reason behind this argument.

The votes, they say, have all along been tallied for various administrative seats in Kisii County and that even the 2019 Census was conducted and tallied as part of Kisii County population.

At the advent of devolution when the conflicts started, former governors James Ongwae of Kisii and John Nyagarama (late) of Nyamira met with other leaders on May 21, 2012, and a resolution that there was no boundary dispute as conventional boundaries at the town were well known.

A joint working committee in Keroka town was to report to Mr Nyagarama to create one centre of power. Mr Nyagarama, in turn, was to share reports with Mr Ongwae.

The duo was to appoint a town administrator and a deputy administrator who would oversee the service delivery in the town, such as garbage collection, provision of water, and firefighting, among others.

On May 21, 2014, various leaders from the two counties met at Nairobi Club and formed a committee on the administration and management of Keroka town.

Accordingly, issues of Keroka were to be managed jointly by the two counties as a way to ensure a lasting solution.

A fifth of chief executives cut jobs as sales decline,"About a fifth (22.4 per cent) of chief executives of private sector firms reduced jobs in the three months ended March as weak demand for goods and services persisted.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) survey that targeted CEOs of over 1,000 private sector through direct online questionnaires showed the job cuts came on the back of a third (33.6 per cent) of the surveyed businesses posting a fall in sales in the review period compared to the previous three-month period ended December 2023.

Executives drawn from diverse sectors including manufacturing and agriculture are also painting grim pictures for job seekers in the current second quarter of the year. About 19.6 per cent of them told the CBK they expect to cut their headcount in the three months ending June.

Sales declined

The January to March period had seen the majority (60.7 per cent) of CEOs keep their numbers unchanged while just 16.8 per cent hired more workers. In the current quarter, 63.6 per cent expect to keep their staff count unchanged while just 16.8 per cent see chances of hiring.

Read: Why more Kenyan CEOs are planning job cuts before Jan 1

The CBK survey shows while a third of the CEOs had seen sales decline in the first quarter, 32.7 per cent of the businesses did not see any change in sales even as another 33.6 per cent posted increased sales compared with the three months ended December 2023.

Firms in the manufacturing sector were the most hit, with 45.5 per cent of CEOs surveyed saying they had seen a drop in demand for their goods while a further 18.2 per cent saw no change. A third (33.3 per cent) of CEOs leading firms in the agricultural sector posted a decline as 27.8 per cent of those in the services sector saw reduced demand.

Increased cost of production

“Business activity in the manufacturing sector remained subdued, largely due to the low consumer purchasing power and the increased cost of production, particularly cost of energy and credit,” said the CBK in the survey. The survey usually targets CEOs of key private sector organisations including members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance.

In terms of employment, 40 per cent of respondents employed less than 100 employees, while 29 per cent of respondents hired over 500 people.

The CBK findings, when compared to those released last December, show that the manufacturing sector remains the most affected when it comes to reduced demand for goods.

“Most respondents in the manufacturing sector expect business activity to either remain the same or increase, largely driven by seasonality factors. Firms expect to utilise their existing idle capacity to meet the demand,” the survey said.

Have floods humanitarian assistance plan,"As it continues to rain heavily, as forecast by the Kenya Meteorological Department, several people have died with many others displaced as a result of flooding in different parts of the country.

According to the Met, Nairobi, Kiambu, western Kenya, Nyanza and the coastal region are expected to experience heavy rains this month.

Last month, at least 10 people died in floods as a result of heavy rainfall in Nairobi while several families were displaced amid the destruction of homes and other property. Torrential rains in Mwea, Kirinyaga County, submerged homes, rendering 700 people from three villages homeless as the Thiba River broke its banks.

The floods also destroyed rice paddies in the local irrigation scheme and submerged business premises. As the heavy rains continue, those living near rivers and lakes should take precautions and be prepared for the possibility of flooding as the chances of breaking their banks are very high.

Meanwhile, the government should set up rescue centres and deploy emergency services for those people in flood-prone areas. That will ensure nobody is killed, injured or displaced in case of flooding and also offer guidance and counselling services to those traumatised by the catastrophe.

The government should also set aside emergency funds to cater for such cases and ease. Humanitarian assistance should be readily available.

"Ensure children play, it helps them to grow","Many parents force their children to stay indoors and study, play alone or get onto the internet on their digital devices. That usually happens during the school holidays, like now.

However, that denies children the opportunity to interact with their peers. Allowing children to play and enjoy their childhood is crucial for their physical and mental development. It also enhances physical health through movement activities since it boosts the growth of, especially, the muscles.

Play also provides children with an opportunity for emotional development. The can express their emotions by laughing and crying and learn more about association with their friends.

The memories of a great day linger on their minds for a long time, even in adulthood. They develop emotional intelligence and resilience.

Social interaction is also achieved. They make friends and get to learn one another’s behaviours. Some even become lifetime friends. Playing children also attain social skills when they negotiate, share and resolve conflicts among themselves.

Besides, play is a natural stress reliever. Allowing one to enjoy their childhood prevents the scenario where teenagers do things that appear childish, which they might have been denied.

With the current technology, children may do great things when they come together. A lot of the content we enjoy on social media is created by children, ranging from music to comedy.

Parents should allow their children to interact with others and explore their creativity as they could do something constructive. Lastly, research shows children who fail to play and exercise are slow learners and introverts while those who do are always jovial and extroverts.

Here’s how to deal with your ex-husband’s new girlfriend,"There’ll always be ‘other women’ in your life. And your children’s. Grandmothers, aunts, cousins, teachers. And they can all be troublesome on occasions!

But nobody compares to that special ‘other woman,’ your ex-husband’s new squeeze. Though to be fair, she thinks that you’re also a nightmare. Her new boyfriend’s ex!

You hate the way she plays happy families with your children, and that your ex helps with hers.

Meanwhile, she feels vulnerable because you and her boyfriend have a history together, and must have been happy together, once upon a time, so anytime she treats you badly, it’s probably more about her insecurities than anything else.

She may try to mother your children, which will cause a lot of problems, but it’s almost an instinct. She’ll also feel that your ex is paying you too much child support, however illogical that may seem.

Hopefully all the drama will subside, but it may take quite a while, meanwhile, everything about her makes you angry, and you resent her becoming a part of your children’s lives.

It’s important to overcome feelings like these. Try to recognise that you and your ex’s new girlfriend are really two sides of the same coin. Two women caught in a web of vulnerabilities, anxieties and jealousies.

So, don’t make negative comments or ask intrusive questions when your ex mentions her, rather, try to deal with your feelings on your own. Don’t hate her just because of who she is, try instead to focus on the needs of your children.

For instance, you can’t insist that the new girlfriend can never meet them. Of course you want to, but just don’t.

Smile and be polite when you meet her, however miserable you feel inside. Try to be friendly and to get to know her. You probably have a lot in common, after all you both chose to have a relationship with the same man. She can even become your ally in bringing up your children, and in managing your ex’s behaviour towards you.

Don’t ask your children about her. That will just motivate them to start lying to you about their time together. And whatever you do, don’t involve them in disputes, or make them feel guilty for having fun with her because it really is ok for your children to enjoy her company. No one can ever replace you as their mother. She may act like she is, but your children do understand the difference.

They’ll also soon grow up, therefore work towards the adult relationship you’ll have with them in the future, which will last far longer than their childhood.

And when you’re ready to start dating, just go for it! It’s good for your children to see you in a relationship, but choose someone who understands all the issues, probably because they’re in the same situation.

It will be hard work, but with your support, your children will do just fine. And that’s all that really matters.

Do you tend to judge others based on their appearance?,"This week, I learnt something about a colleague I have worked with for years that not only surprised me but also brought to the fore how cosmetic our interactions can be with people we generally spend most of our day with. It was on the Tuesday following the long Easter weekend, and since the last I’d seen him was Thursday the week before, I enquired how his Easter had been and what he did to mark the holiday.

He laughed and said, “I don’t celebrate Easter.” This profession is no respecter of holidays, unless you’re on leave or it is your off day, a holiday, any holiday, is a working day for us.

I therefore assumed he meant that he worked through Easter. Since I knew his off days were Friday and Saturday, I was puzzled and enquired why he worked throughout the weekend, to which he clarified that he doesn’t celebrate Easter because he’s Muslim. I thought he was pulling my leg because, among other things, his surname is common with people who come from the Rift Valley a place he calls home, a place that he grew up in. He had been a practicing Muslim for over 20 years, he told me.

That conversation got me reflecting on how we can exist in the same space with someone for years, and talk to each other daily, yet fail to really know one another because our interactions are superficial and rarely scratch the surface.

We are satisfied with the automatic, “How are you?”, “I’m fine,” kind of interaction that, when you think about it, means nothing. That conversation nudged me to examine how I generally interact with people, (outside of my family and close friends) that I spend time with daily. I found myself wanting.

The truth is that many of us tend to make assumptions about other people based on their appearance, and how they look. How they talk, how they dress, where they live, where and what they eat, where they work, where they went to school, yet all these are general characteristics that can be quite misleading. You see a well-dressed man or woman and you assume that they must be well-off, while you are likely to view the less well-dressed ones as struggling.

I was once seated in a café somewhere next to a group of young college-going girls when a woman who did not look affluent in any way walked towards this huge, gleaming, no doubt very expensive machine of a car, opened the door to the driver’s seat, got in and zoomed off, no doubt to her a house somewhere in a leafy suburb. The group exclaimed in surprise and one of the young women commented, “Aki hakai hiyo gari…” From her appearance, the woman did not look like the category of women who could afford such a car, and they wondered why anyone who could afford such a luxury car not dress to ‘match’ her car.

I have seen the same attitude in outlets that sell clothes, whether it is in one of the many boutiques around the country or high-end clothing stores. You walk in and the first thing the attendant does is look you up and down, after which he or she immediately forms an opinion about you.

In this case, whether or not you can afford what they are selling. The conclusion they form will determine how they treat you, whether they will be cold and standoffish, or whether they will be welcoming and ingratiating towards you.

Unfortunately, this is an attitude that ends up costing many business owners a significant amount of money every year, an attitude that can bring down businesses. This Sunday, should you be tempted to judge someone by appearance only, remember the saying, ‘Never judge a book by its cover’. More times than not, it rings true.

 ,"Meru County Governor Kawira Mwangaza may have publicly announced her decision to join President William Ruto’s UDA without any proof of registration and membership certificate.

If she indeed proves her new membership with UDA, she may have shot herself in the foot following her decision to join the ruling party.

But before she is included in the list of the UDA party, returns must be filed with the Office Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) showing she has changed status.

Read: Explainer: Why Kenya is taking part in the Haiti mission

Ms Mwangaza was elected in the August 9, 2022 general election as an independent candidate based on the provisions of Article 85 of the constitution on the eligibility of one to stand as an independent candidate.

It states: “Any person is eligible to stand as an independent candidate for election if the person is not a member of a registered political party and has not been a member for at least three months immediately before the date of the election.”

There is however a lacuna in law, the constitution and the subsidiary law on

on the status of leaders elected as independent candidates joining political parties midstream their terms.

Section 14 of the Political Parties Act, 2022 provides for the resignation from a political party but does not address that of an independent candidate, joining a party.

Therefore, once the returns of Governor Mwangaza’s membership with UDA are filed with the ORPP, she stands a candidate for removal from office for abandoning her independent candidate status and joining a political party.

Now, having “joined” UDA, Governor Mwangaza is left with no option but to resign as a Meru Governor and seek a fresh mandate from the people of Meru on the UDA ticket.

As per the constitution in Article 182 (1), it provides for how a vacancy in the office of a County Governor comes about.

The Article states that the office of the county governor shall become vacant if the holder of the office dies, resigns and in writing, addressed to the speaker of the County Assembly.

A person also ceases to be a County Governor if the person is convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months, is removed from office under “this” constitution or ceases to be eligible to be elected county governor under Article 180 (2) of the constitution.

Now, Article 180 (1) of the constitution states that the county governor shall be directly elected by the voters registered in the county, on the same day as a general election of Members of Parliament, being the second Tuesday in August, in every fifth year.

It goes on in sub-article 2 to state that to be eligible for election as county governor, a person must be eligible for election as a Member of the County Assembly (MCA).

To be eligible for election as an MCA, one is required to satisfy the requirements of Article 193 (1) (c) (ii) of the constitution.

This provision states that unless disqualified, a person is eligible for election as a member of a county assembly if the person is either nominated by a political party or an independent candidate supported by at least five hun­dred registered voters in the ward concerned.

Sometime back, Isiolo County Governor Abdi Guyo claimed to have left his Jubilee Party for UDA.

However, to date, his supposed new party is yet to file returns with the ORPP showing his changed party status because he knows the consequences.

So, Governor Mwangaza “joining” UDA could be another red herring.

"Trump calls migrants 'animals,' intensifying focus on illegal immigration","Donald Trump called immigrants illegally in the United States ""animals"" and ""not human"" in a speech in Michigan on Tuesday, resorting to the degrading rhetoric he has employed time and again on the campaign trail.

The Republican presidential candidate, appearing with several law enforcement officers, described in detail several criminal cases involving suspects in the country illegally and warned that violence and chaos would consume America if he did not win the November 5 election.

In a later speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin, he struck a similarly foreboding tone, describing the 2024 election as the nation's ""final battle.""

While speaking of Laken Riley - a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia allegedly murdered by a Venezuelan immigrant in the country illegally - Trump said some immigrants were sub-human.

""The Democrats say, 'Please don't call them animals. They're humans.' I said, 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals,'"" said Trump, president from 2017 to 2021.

In Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump described meeting the family of Ruby Garcia, a local 25-year-old murdered last month by a suspect in the country illegally, according to police. Garcia's sister denied the former president spoke with the family, according to local media reports.

In stump speeches, Trump frequently claims that immigrants crossing the border with Mexico illegally have escaped from prisons and asylums in their home countries and are fueling violent crime in the United States.

While available data on criminals' immigration status is sparse, researchers say people living in the U.S. illegally do not commit violent crimes at a higher rate than native-born citizens.

Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump's rival in the November presidential election, accuses Trump of encouraging Republicans in Congress not to pass legislation this year that would have beefed up security at the southern border and introduced measures aimed at reducing illegal immigration.

""Donald Trump is engaging in extreme rhetoric that promotes division, hate and violence in our country,"" Michael Tyler, Biden campaign communications director, told reporters on Tuesday ahead of Trump's speeches.

Trump titled his Michigan speech ""Biden's border bloodbath,"" and said he met family members of Garcia, who was allegedly murdered last month in her car by Brandon Ortiz-Vite, 25, whom she was dating.

""They said she had just this most contagious laughter, and when she walked into a room, she lit up that room, and I've heard that from so many people. I spoke to some of her family,"" Trump said.

Mavi Garcia, Ruby Garcia's sister, disputed that account, according to local television stations.

""He did not speak with any of us, so it was kind of shocking seeing that he had said that he had spoke with us,"" Mavi Garcia was quoted as saying by a local NBC affiliate.

Reuters was not able to immediately contact Garcia's family. A Trump campaign representative declined to comment on the record.

The murders of Garcia and Riley have allowed Trump's campaign to play simultaneously to some voters' fears about violent crime and immigration.

Some 38% of Republicans cited immigration as the country's top issue in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late February, as did about one in five independents.Trump frequently claims without evidence that migrants have caused a spike in violent crime in U.S. cities. On Tuesday, he repeated an unfounded claim that Latin American nations are intentionally sending their criminals to the United States.

TUESDAY'S WISCONSIN PRIMARY

During his evening speech in Wisconsin, Trump pledged he would stop the ""plunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of our American suburbs, cities and towns.""

He also warned that the coming election could be America's last.

""This country is finished if we don't win this election,"" he said. ""And I heard somebody say ... two or three days ago, said, if we don't win, this may be the last election our country ever has. And there could be truth to it.""

Michigan and Wisconsin are two swing states that could determine whether Biden or Trump occupies the White House next year.

In the 2020 election, Biden beat Trump in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point and in Michigan by less than three. Both states are expected to be extremely close again this year.

Although both Trump and Biden have mathematically clinched their presidential nominations, they will be on their party's presidential primary ballots in Wisconsin on Tuesday.

The Biden team will be watching for protest votes by Democrats angry over the president's strong support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.

In February's presidential primary in Michigan, a state with a large Muslim population, Biden easily won the primary but more than 100,000 Democrats voted ""uncommitted,"" instead of for Biden, as a protest over his Gaza policy.

A similar option is available in Wisconsin on Tuesday. The protest campaign's goal is to get 20,682 voters to mark their ballots ""uninstructed,"" Wisconsin's version of ""uncommitted."" The number is significant because it represents Biden's winning margin over Trump in the state in 2020.

Where divorcees meet without being judged,"Support group for divorcees where no one is judged

Support group for divorcees where no one is judged

Divorce in Kenya is still considered taboo. The first question divorced individuals get from strangers who learn of their status is “Did you try everything to salvage the marriage?” However, a failed marriage does not make one a failure, because it takes two to establish a strong one. People are not possessions. Even your spouse is not yours to own, so you cannot control them.

“Everybody is just an experience for you to enjoy a moment with. And when that moment is over, let them go! It’s not the end of the world, you’re going to have another experience… and another,” says 41-year-old Christine Muthoni, a lawyer specialising in family law.

Christine has handled numerous divorce cases, child custody disputes and disagreements involving property and inheritance.

Her book, Conscious Uncoupling: A Personal Journey, was published in May 2023. In August this year, she became a certified divorce coach.

Christine got married, hoping that it would be the beginning of her “happily ever after”. When her ex-husband first brought up the divorce topic, she was shocked and in disbelief.

She resisted because there were children involved. But despite trying everything, they realised the best thing was for both to go separate ways rather than stay in an unhappy union. This was the less painful and traumatic choice. Her ex-husband suggested that she files for divorce because she was familiar with the process, and they would not have to pay another lawyer for it. But she had to find fault in him.

“If you’re looking for fault, you will find it. The other person doesn’t know their faults, and when you write about their flaws they automatically feel they need to file their own documents to set the records straight. That’s where it gets murky. And even if you did not foresee it going down that path, divorce takes a life of its own. It is never beautiful, and there’s no winner,” says Christine, adding that people process divorce differently.



Coping with isolation

If you are familiar with tools to deal with grief and get professional help in the form of therapy, then you can cope with it better. You can co-parent and even be friends once you get past the anger.

Christine learned about Oasis Experience while doing her divorce coaching certification. All participants must be divorcees. Part of the requirements was that she attends group therapy for her divorce. She wrote an e-mail to Nairobi Chapel and she was given Tony Hutia’s contact. He invited her to the graduation of the second cohort and she was amazed by the bond of the group.

Read: Unspoken trials: The stigma we faced after divorce

“It was a celebration and I was wondering, ‘People are celebrating being divorced?’,” laughs out Christine.

She was inspired by the celebration of life even after divorce, and she signed up immediately. As a divorce lawyer, she had always offered legal and sometimes emotional support to clients. Her book was being cited by therapists. She had always been the strong one. But after her first session, when she saw people talking about their experiences in a structured manner according to the workbook, she realised she had been bottling things up. She had never put herself in the position of needing help.

“I would talk so much because I had a lot to say. This is the environment for me to get help. If I’m angry, I’m going to tell them and say what I’m angry about, and nobody is going to judge me,” says Christine.

Even while happily married, Christine was not a religious person.

“Oasis is church-based and scriptural, but they discuss things the way they are in real life. They don’t preach and they didn’t condemn me. They understand there are various aspects to a human being – there is the spiritual bit but also the material bit which is what is hurting right now so badly because of divorce,” says Christine.

Oasis Experience is run by four divorce coaches – Sandro Tangut, Tony Hutia, Catherine Nyambura, Aswani Labwende – who first started divorce counselling at Nairobi Chapel on Ngong Road after their marriages fell apart.

Sandro, a business development manager in the ICT solutions-selling business, went through a divorce in 2017. During that time, he found that he did not have a place he could go to and talk about what he was feeling. At 24, he had made up his mind to spend the rest of his life with his ex-wife, so it was a shock to him when his spouse of 14 years filed for divorce.

“There was a rollercoaster of emotions when I heard, ‘We’re separating and I’m filing for divorce.’ I tried doing a lot of things, including church programmes. I thought, ‘How do I salvage this situation?’ You go looking for the best couple. If they cannot salvage things, you go looking for the relatives. Then you turn to the reverend at the church you were joined. After that, you turn to prayers and then resign to your fate. And the default for most men is turning to alcohol or looking for other women,” remembers Sandro.

Co-parenting reality

Marriage had become his identity. He did not know what going back to singlehood would look like. They had children and did everything together. His peers were also married and now he was an outcast in the group. Like a lot of people, he felt let down by the church, who after failing to reconcile the couple, had not offered much help for what was coming. In most mainstream churches, those whose marriages have collapsed are barred from serving in the church.

“The church is like a hospital. You can imagine I’m wounded then the hospital throws me out. If the church tells you ‘We cannot accommodate you’, should you go to the people of the world who are very open?” thought Sandro at the time.

He found himself at Nairobi Chapel. It is one of the few churches that has embraced divorcees and has a programme in their church. He joined the programme as a divorce care facilitator in 2019.

After processing the negative emotions, Sandro started talking about his journey on social media and attracted a lot of feedback. He felt motivated and registered for an online course on Udemy to become a certified therapist. What was supposed to be a pain, has now become a lesson for him and others. The quartet started the Oasis Experience in 2022 with Anthony, Catherine, Aswani and him as directors.

“We decided to have the setting outside of the church and help people wholesomely. We will not throw verses at you and threaten you with hell if you don’t listen to the Bible or follow the scripture, we will walk with you at your own pace until you feel healed and no longer bitter with God or the church,” says Sandro.

The programme

THE OASIS Experience is a 13-week programme that deals with relational, emotional, financial and legal issues to help divorcees financially, legally and emotionally. Financially, they teach participants how to adjust from a two-income home to a one-income household. Legally, they teach how to plan for the cases and lawyers. Emotionally, they help participants avoid sinking into depression.

Read: What does it take to file for divorce and child custody?

There is a workbook with topics that are to be covered each week. One can then journal their thoughts on specific topics. There is also a 30-minute video where those who’ve gone through divorce share their experiences on the topic being covered. There is also group therapy where members sit together and discuss their experiences, hopes and challenges.

Every last Friday of the month, they have a session called “Taboo Topics.” They pick topics which are not commonly spoken in church or different forums. One of the topics is marrying a single mother with a son. There is a big discussion in the “man-osphere” on men being told to avoid marrying single mothers.

Potluck picnics in Karura Forest or the Nairobi Arboretum are also used to break the classroom setting in between the programme.

Due to the stigma attached to divorce, most people are usually hesitant about admitting they are going through divorce. Sandro’s call to action is, “Men out there, know you’re not alone. Even as you’re walking through that separation and divorce, don’t be ashamed to stand out and say ‘My marriage has ended and I’m grieving’.” There are spaces where you can sit with other men and they’ll walk with you, and you will not be ashamed.

“At the end of the day, we are human and have emotions. Most men who don’t seek help end up killing their wives or children for revenge. Some people even gone through saddening experiences that when you listen to them, you realise that what you’re going through is not as big an issue.”



Finding self

Tony works in the ICT world and does a lot of mentorship for boys and men. He was married for 10 years before separating with his ex-wife in 2012. Last year, he decided to get support in terms of group therapy. A lot of Oasis Experience’s members are leaders in various corporates and often take a failed marriage harder than failing a career-defining project.

“In corporate, you can follow those five key steps (structure, culture, power and influence, identity and guiding principles) to reinvent and rebuild yourself, but nobody thinks about it deliberately in marriage. How do you turn that lemon and make lemonade,” asks Tony.

He says lots of marriages fail because, unlike work, people don’t deliberately think about what it takes to make marriage work. Men can lead in many other areas of life but don’t do the same in their homes and instead, relegate that role to their wives. Research shows that divorce is particularly devastating to successful people.

“Nobody takes you through that process of you growing from a boy, to a man, and then a father. You expect it to be natural because you consider yourself a man. But you go for training and capacity building for any other thing to better your career skills. You gain the whole world and lose your soul, yet the soul is core,” says Tony, adding that men have been made to understand that (financial) provision is their sole responsibility in the relationship while leaving out things like guidance, leadership and support.

Tony says he got into mentoring because he realised that he is perfect only in the things his father taught him, like how to work hard and make nyama choma. He cannot remember being taught anything about relationships by his father.

“Most people who come for divorce therapy think they know and can do it without help because men are always told to ‘soldier on’. I tried to do facilitations for “Man Enough” and I could see it. I thought the best place to start from is going a level down and start with the young men. Capture them early to make them better people,” says Tony.

He holds three-day camps for boys (from when they are eight years old until they undergo circumcision) at a resort he owns and they encourage fathers to spend the last night with their sons to discuss what they’ve learnt.

Sandro and Tony went on to take a second shot at marriage and family life. They call themselves “two-star generals”.

Sandro tied the knot again in 2020 and has a one-year-old daughter. He had three sons in his previous marriage. Tony got into a new relationship while he was still going through the divorce from his first wife, and has been married for nine years. He has a son and a daughter in his second marriage, similar to the first.

He was a couple’s counsellor in his previous church and was asked to step down after his divorce. His married friends were asked to keep away from him by their spouses. Tony says he had to take his mind out of “revenging against this one woman on every other woman.” He realised that while he was single he would be spending money on all these women and put himself at risk of sexually transmitted diseases. He was also putting himself in a position of possibly fathering children with multiple women. Everyone wanted something from him, yet he had gotten married so that someone would help him.

“You can only help in areas that you’re strong in. I wanted someone that would have my back as I’m building my kingdom,” says Tony.

Catherine, an interior designer, has never tried marriage again 11 years after her 14-year marriage ended. The counselling psychologist, who is a mother to two adult sons and recently a grandmother, wanted to be part of a tribe where she would not have to explain herself much while talking about challenges she faced with co-parenting and blended families. She and her husband mutually agreed to divorce.

“You come to a point where nothing makes sense. You don’t share the same parental skills, view family and marriage differently, and have different financial and religious values. As priorities change and you grow older, you grow apart,” says Catherine.

Although her husband was a good provider and took good care of them, Catherine decided to take her children and provide for them. It was scary at first, because she moved from a house they owned and had to start paying rent, and from a two-income household to being the sole breadwinner. It was difficult but she was able to do it with her family’s help. She has always been at Nairobi Chapel and was among the first cohort to benefit from the divorce counselling ministry at the church.



Healing

“Those who went through a divorce before me are surprised because they never got that help. In church, we would have to counsel men and women separately, but at Oasis we meet together. We want both parties to understand what the other side is going through, otherwise, we’ll just be “daughters of Jezebel” and they will be “sons of Adam”. We encourage friendships even after the class to make remarrying possible,” says Catherine, adding that the key to healing after divorce is vulnerability and being ready to try again.

Aswani is a ghostwriter. She is the newest kid on the block when it comes to being divorced. Describing herself as “divorced then but now single”, she was married in 2016, separated in 2019, and filed for divorce in 2021 and it took six months to finalise.

Most religions including Christianity encourage reconciliation or enduring difficult situations in marriage, and women are especially burdened with the task of “keeping the family together”.

Having done a white wedding, Aswani says that she had 450 witnesses to her failure. She was walking around with this aura of anger and people would even keep away. She couldn’t talk about how she truly felt in the church set-up. Other coping mechanisms that many divorcees use like rebound sex or drinking (self-medication) are taboo to talk about even in society.

“If you mention these, you will attract condemnation. But at Oasis we talk about the things that are happening on the ground without judging. And it’s not just about the extremes, it could be you’re just picking fights with others. But at the end of the day, we will bring Christ in a way that is relatable to us,” says Aswani.

The Oasis Experience classes are run from Weal House every Saturday. They are also currently working on a counselling experience for children of divorced parents.

Men enjoy a genuine public display of love,"Several days ago, on the main road that leads to my home, I saw people rubbernecking at a Muslim couple.

The woman, in a hijab, was tying the man's shoelaces. I guess that on their journey to wherever, the man's sneakers’ laces came untied and the woman — (perhaps his wife) — was just being loving and dutiful.

I did not think much about it. But it's the stares and comments from some members of the public that caused me to deeply think about this random public display of service.

“Mimi, hata na dawa, siwezi kufanya mtumwa na mwanaume,” (I cannot do that for a man) one woman muttered to her friend, glaring at the dutiful Muslim woman as if she was committing treason.

“Wanaume ni wale wale!” (Men are the same)

“Huyo inaonekana hajapata (this one is yet to get) character development,” her friend chimed.

Well, these are the same women you will see going down on bended knees, in public, on dirty sidewalks, bouquets in hand, when they welcome their “man of God”.

Service and servitude

These types of women only draw a line in the sand when it comes to serving their husbands. But when it comes to their “man of God”, they will serve him everything.

It's these types of women — who are fallacy personified — who will bow to their bosses, be at their beck and call, and work their fingers to the bone for their bosses; yet give their man the middle finger when he requests for a back scratch after a hard day’s work.

The definition of service is an act of assistance to someone. On the other hand, servitude is the state of being a slave or being forced to work for others or do their bidding without one's consent or against one's will, either in perpetuity or for a period over which one has little or no control.

Some sisters fail to differentiate between service and servitude. I don't blame all of you, though. Some sisters were abused in relationships, which made them loathe the very thought of being in service to a man. But others have fallen victim to hate that's been spewed against all men.

When couples have spontaneous public displays of service — without compulsion or coercion — it shows their love is deep. These spontaneous displays can be seen, for instance, when a man adjusts his woman's out-of-place lock of hair.

This spontaneous display was demonstrated about eight years ago by President Barack Obama when she guarded First Lady Michelle Obama’s dignity, as they were boarding Air Force One while jetting from their holiday in Hawaii.

Public perceptions

Michelle was wearing a wavy blue dress. A gust of wind blew her dress, but Obama, being the consummate gentleman, put her right hand over so slightly over her back.

A weaker man would've gone: “Deal with it, baby; your dress, your choice.”

These spontaneous displays can be seen when a woman adjusts her man's tie or licks her forefinger and then rolls it down her man's eyebrows.

Here's the thing. For a partner to bend low — literally and figuratively — and be of service to their better half in public, shows they are confident in their place in the relationship.

It also shows they have built their relationship over time — mostly in secret spaces — to an extent that when there is a need for service, there are no second thoughts or long-drawn deliberations, either openly or in their minds. They just do it. They are not (mis)led by public perceptions.

Kudos to y'all who are about public displays of service.

Who said cleaning and cooking is only the woman’s role?,"Recently, I was caught up in an interesting debate online. It centered on the roles of a husband and wife in a marriage.

“Marriage no longer comes with a job description or manual as it did in the older days,” Ann Wambui, a reader said.

“Husbands went out to work and provided for the family while wives stayed at home and raised children. Everyone was happy,” she went on.

But things have since changed, it was noted.

Another reader Kenneth Sang’ weighed in: “Today, things are different. You will die hustling if your wife has no income to complement yours. And there is also the harsh reality that women are bringing home the bigger bacon!”

While Kenneth insisted that the traditional roles of a husband and wife were no longer tenable, Neema Njeri disagreed.

“Nothing has changed. A woman is a nurturer and gifted with homemaking skills. Only a lazy man depends on his wife for provision,” Neema said.

Struggle with adjusting in marriage

David Muema, a self-proclaimed marriage counsellor, had a sober argument.

“After more than two decades of what I consider a happy marriage, and after counselling many couples, I have concluded that, other than the obvious biological distinctions, such as who should breastfeed a child, the other roles are purely manmade. Each couple should craft the roles that work for them, and not what society dictates,” he said.

Silus Wanjala, a reader, shed light on why couples, especially the newlyweds struggle with adjusting in a marriage.

“They are trying to figure out their respective roles,” he said.

He noted that submission was misunderstood by husbands and wives.

“Some husbands take advantage of the submissive wife. Marriage is about teamwork, with each partner playing their part,” Silus said.

While Silus expounded on the Biblical meaning of submission, he cautioned wives against mistaking it to mean being subservient.

“Some women mistake submission to mean being a ‘yes’ woman, which makes it an unappealing idea. No human is inferior to the other.”

Roles of husband and wife

Silus explained that submission simply means, “Allowing your husband to lead, as you remain the greatest team player.”

Silus noted that there are roles that come naturally to either of the couples, which means that they automatically fall into a routine.

“Women are good at planning and organising finances and stuff. Men are not. That’s why you will see a man always asking where his socks, boxers, and shirts are,” Silus says.

Some people are clear about who does what in a marriage. Woe unto them when they get married and discover that their spouse has a different worldview on such roles.

Simon, a blogger once posted, “I have moved houses and now need a wife to sort the curtains and other house matters.”

And the response from readers was swift and brutal.

“Is a wife a maid? A curtain fundi or tailor?” said one reader.

What came out clearly from the debate is that the roles of husband and wife need to be complementary.

Complementarian principles

Focus on The Family, a platform dedicated to strengthening families, defines the complementarian principles thus, ‘it means that husbands and wives embrace roles that are intrinsically equal in worth and value but distinct and unique in design, role, and function. One isn’t better than the other; they complete or complement each other.’

To avoid unnecessary power struggles, the complementarian teaching advances that, ultimately, each should strive to serve the other.

The idea is to focus on each other's needs and best interests.

Complementarians view marriage as a team effort.

The husband takes on a servant leadership role, using his strength to love and protect, while the wife uses her nurturing strength and wisdom to advise and encourage.

Complementarianism considers the submission of each spouse to the other.

Biblical submission never dominates, demeans, demands, or abuses another person. It does not require spouses to deny their gift or personality or shut off their intellect.

Biblical submission is about treasuring the other person.

Why land in Nairobi's high-end estates is losing appeal,"

House rental prices in Kitisuru have, for instance, contracted in each of the last five years while apartment selling prices have slumped by the same measure across Kilimani, Lavington, and Riverside. Land prices in the lucrative nodes of Riverside and Upperhill have also contracted in each of the last five years.

Crews take stock of performance as the dust settles on Safari Rally,"Kalle Rovanpera of Finland returns home a hero as the FIA observer prepares his post mortem report on the World Rally Championship Safari Rally.

Manufacturers, drivers and fans are also taking stock of the competition, which took place from March 28-31 in Nairobi and Naivasha. Toyota’s Kalle Rovanpera and his co-driver Jonne Halttunen won the Safari Rally on Sunday, with Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville stretching his championship lead to six points despite finishing only fifth.

Double world champion Rovanpera, competing in selected events only this season before a full return next year, led from Friday and finished one minute and 37.8 seconds clear of his team mate Takamoto Katsuta over the rough gravel roads.

M-Sport Ford’s Adrien Fourmaux finished third. Toyota lead Hyundai by four points in the manufacturers’ championship, and the next round is in Croatia, on asphalt, from April 18-21.

Although this year’s competition lacked the buzz of the last two editions, for Rovanpera, his co-driver Jonne Halttunen, and the Toyota team, the harvest in Kenya was bountiful.

Rovanpera won his second WRC Safari Rally title in a Toyota Yaris GR Hybrid two years his first after four days of relentless competition in Nairobi, Naivasha and Gilgil.

This was yet another successful round of the FIA World Championship, which this year had the distinction of promoting the beautiful images of Kenya as a tourism destination in 50 countries through 150 stations, reaching 82 million people.

The Safari Rally was brought forward to Easter holidays from June to recreate a historic past when nothing else mattered in East Africa around that time. It was meant to attract more fans, and to avoid disrupting normal life, given that previous editions held since 2021 have witnessed traffic snarl up on all roads leading to, and from Naivasha.

Carl Tundo and his navigator Tim Jessop, driving a Ford Fiesta car, were the highest placed Kenyans in 16th place in the main World Rally Championship (WRC), but they were seventh in the Rally 2 category, and came out top of the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC) category.

Reigning Africa Rally Championship winner, Karan Patel, was 18th overall, having retired on Saturday but re-joined the rally on Sunday after mechanics fixed the strut in his Skoda Fabia car.

“I am happy with my performance in the Safari Rally, and I feel encouraged to compete once again in the Africa Rally Championship series,” Patel said.

He was followed by Aakif Virani (Skoda Fabia) and Minesh Rathod (Mitsubishi Lancer EVO) in the main WRC category.

A senior Executive of the WRC Promoter, the German-based commercial rights holder of the FIA WRC, Peter Thul, estimated that the Safari Rally will have realised or exceeded its media commercial value, which is estimated at over Sh4 billion, following concerted effort with the Kenyan government to create pre-event media publicity. Top drivers visited the Masai Mara and shared their experiences with millions of fans around the world on social media.

In addition, Thul said the WRC and FIA are very much willing to remain in Kenya as the Safari Rally is a unique event in the 13-rounds WRC calendar, and the only one in Africa as they have financial guarantees from the government, and aspirations for growth in the corporate sector which came through commercial sponsorship for the event and drivers.

The KCB Bank, Toyota Kenya, Safaricom and Betika were some of the sponsors who supported the event and drivers, led by Carl Tundo who finished 16th overall in the main World Rally Championship category, and seventh in the Rally 2 category.

Rovanpera, twice youngest world champion ever at age 24, drove through the 367km competitive distance after taking the lead on Friday from Belgian Thierry Neuville, driving a Hyundai i20 Hybrid Rally1 car. Neuville had won the Kasarani Super Special Stage on Thursday by winning all the six stages of the day.

He started the day with a lead of over 2 minutes 55 seconds over team mate Takamoto Katsuta and still managed to ease off to safeguard his lead despite team Katsuta closing in but could only manage to reduce this gap to 1:37.8 minutes.

“Lottery stage,” said Katsuta after a puncture at Malewa morning stage which affected his challenge to Rovanpera “Quite stupid to be honest.""

Frenchman Adrien Fourmaux completed the podium and gave M-Sport Ford a morale boosting third position and their first podium finish in 22 years since the late Colin McRae won the 2002 Safari Rally in a Ford Focus.

The young Frenchman, 29, has also been sponsored by Mpesa Global and Kenya Airways. He will be flying colours of both companies in the WRC remaining 10 rounds.

Toyota's Elfyn Evans finished fourth followed by Neuville. Thierry Neuville, who had started the Safari on a promising note but mechanical issues dogged him throughout the rally. He was unable to pick maximum points on Sunday following an impact with a rock, which broke the right-rear suspension on his Hyundai i20 N Rally1 at Hells Gate.

“Impossible to avoid,” Neuville lamented. “I don’t know where they come from but they were massive, two of them.”

Title rival Evans is set to benefit from Neuville’s trouble. But he had sympathy for Neuville’s situation: “It’s a shame. Sometimes it’s a bit of a lottery like that.”

The Safari was divided into three categories--World Rally Championship for Priority 1 drivers; World Rally Championship for Priority 2 drivers; Kenya National Rally Championship for local drivers who do not have modern machines. They competed in only one loop daily of the two loops rally in Kedong/Geothermal/Loldia stages on Friday.

Leg Two was at Soysambu/Elementaita and Sleeping Warrior in Gilgil and Leg three on Sunday at Malewa/Oserian/Hells Gate.

Why Safari Rally winner Rovanpera will not earn prize money,"Kalle Rovanpera was awarded a wooden carving valued at Sh25,000 for winning the 2024 WRC Safari Rally, and celebrated his victory with alcohol-free champagne.

Kenyans have been wondering how one can risk his life, expend too much energy for a wooden carving, noting that it has never been disclosed how much is the prize money for the Safari compared to other local events like the Magical Kenya Open which offers the winner $425,000(Sh55 million) from US$2.5 million (Sh325 million) kitty, Kip Keino Classic Continental Tour and city marathon races.

For a start, there is no prize money on offer in the Safari Rally or national championship events. Instead one is expected to pay between Sh15,000 to Sh50,000 entry fees. You either have old money or should seek sponsors because motorsport is all about business.

But motorsport at the highest level is like any other profession where workers are paid a monthly salary and performance bonuses. They are encouraged to seek endorsements and individual commercial sponsors.

But unlike in other professional sports, rally drivers remuneration is never disclosed to the public. It is an agreement between them and their teams. However, once in a while, drivers disclose their financial worth with the sponsors.

For example, Safaricom Mpesa Global announced a Sh20 million sponsorship for Ford driver Adrien Fourmaux to fly the Mpesa logo in the Safari and 10 other events this year.

However, Colin McRae’s move from Subaru for Ford was reportedly to have cost Ford £6 million (Sh668M) in salaries in 1999, the last publicly disclosed salary for a rally driver.

Since inception, the Safari Rally was not about money. The Safari was born at a bar in Limuru when the two gentlemen Eric Cecil and Vincent Niel decided to do a long distance event for the fun of it.

Thereafter local car franchises adopted the Safari as a marketing tool for their products and initially companies like Marshals East Africa and DT Dobie gave their workshop managers vehicles to drive in the Safari as part of marketing strategies.

But gradually drivers like Shekhar Mehta, Joginder Singh and Vic Preston Junior were identified for such missions before they were snapped by manufacturer teams who started paying them money.

So how much does a top rally driver earn without prize money? Nation Sport combed through the internet and found out that rally drivers are some of the best paid professionals.

A website (Rally Sports) revealed the salary of the driver according to them in which 2023 Safari champion Sebastien Ogier tops the list with annual pay of US$2.5 million (Sh325 million), Thierry Neuville (Sh260 million), and Sébastien Loeb (Sh195 million).

But all these remain estimates minus official communication. Patrick Njiru at his prime was earning Sh8.5 million from BAT sponsorship annually between 1995-97.

The fans also have been asking why the WRC is competed by hatch back cars and not salons.

The website explained that manufacturers rally cars to market and sell cars, and right now hatchbacks are the preferred vehicles in Europe

Hatchbacks have shorter length than sedans, which gives slightly more advantage for agility. Other than that, rally cars use compact sized cars and the majority of the compact cars sold in Europe are hatchbacks, so they use the hatchback models to promote the models to the masses.

Help those struggling with depression amongst us to heal,"The two brothers who reportedly committed suicide in Narok County by hanging themselves due to family issues sparked discussions and emotions in the country. They are just among the many who commit suicide due to depression, calling for decisive actions to combat these cases.

The World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2019 data show about 20 per cent of youth suffer from mental conditions. And there has been a 13 per cent rise in issues like suicide, depression, stress and substance abuse.

The Kenya National Commission of Human Rights reports that about 25 per cent of in-patients suffer from mental conditions. This highlights the urgent need for substantial action to bridge these gaps to prevent losing lives that could be saved.

Many of these cases stem from tough economic times, especially with the significant rise in the cost of living in recent years. The economic strain has pushed individuals into unexpected conditions due to stress and depression, increasing the likelihood of mental health issues. Some 20 per cent of youth turn to drugs, often leading to addiction and subsequent mental decline.

Mental healthcare facilities must undergo thorough quality inspection to ensure a conducive physical and social environment for patients. Improving them will streamline services for outpatients, who are often more challenging to deal with. Maximum resource allocation to mental healthcare should be prioritised.

Counselling departments and rehabilitation centres must be enhanced as youth and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these conditions.

Taking action to raise general awareness is another effective way to ensure adherence to health protocols. The Health ministry should be proactive in ensuring full implementation of these actions to address the issues before they escalate further.

Mental health organisations should advocate prompt reporting whenever such indicators are observed. Lastly, mental conditions can never justify violation of human rights or denying individuals full access to freedom.

"Tundo, Anwar battle big boys to give Safari Rally local flavour","Carl Tundo and Hamza Anwar were the biggest local winners of the 2024 WRC Safari Rally after pushing on regardless of the many hurdles they encountered to score points in the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC) series, and the Junior World Rally Championship (JWRC) respectively.

Toyota’s Kalle Rovanpera and co-driver Jonne Halttunen won the WRC Safari Rally, with Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville stretching his championship lead to six points despite finishing only fifth.

Double world champion Rovanpera, competing in selected events only this season before a full return next year, led from Friday and finished one minute and 37.8 seconds clear of team mate Takamoto Katsuta over the rough gravel roads. M-Sport Ford’s Adrien Fourmaux finished third.

Tundo, navigated by Tim Jessop, struggled with punctures on Saturday but their resilience paid off on Sunday as they finished 16th overall, and 17th in Rally 2 category in a Ford Fiesta car, giving the Safari Rally a Kenyan flavour.

Tundo, who has had a limited rally programme since his semi-retirement in 2021, said he was happy to battle the big boys but he never really had the opportunity to mount a serious challenge for the title.

“After suffering punctures on Friday and Saturday, all I wanted was a finish,” Tundo told Nation Sport on Sunday.

Anwar was Kenya’s only entrant in the Rally 3 category of the Safari Rally, driving a Ford Fiesta car. Despite struggling with many mechanical problems, he still managed to return to the finish in 22nd position overall. Afterwards, he expressed joy at having overcome retirement to rejoin the Safari Rally and score maximum points.

Unfortunately, Anwar, who competed in five JWRC events last year and became the third most improved driver in the world last year, was not registered to compete in this year's edition.

African champion Karan Patel was 18th overall after retiring on Saturday and rejoining the rally on Sunday after mechanics had fixed the strut in his Skoda Fabia car.

“I am happy and encouraged to compete again in the African Rally Championship,” Karan, who will be supported by KCB Bank, said. He was followed by Aakif Virani (Skoda Fabia) and Minesh Rathod (Mitsubishi Lancer EVO) in the main WRC.

The Rally 2 title was won by Britain’s Gus Greensmith in a Skoda Fabia car. He managed to squeeze himself in the main Rally 1 category and finished seventh overall, followed by Swedish Oliver Solberg in a similar car.

Greensmith drove with flu-like symptoms but never relented even as Solberg breathed down his neck as he opened a three-minute lead on Friday and remained put until he closed the finish line on Sunday.

Greensmith got his WRC2 campaign off to the perfect start after winning the FIA World Rally Championship’s premier support category by 1m 23.1 in his Škoda Fabia RS Rally over Solberg.

Solberg suffered a couple of punctures but enjoyed the consolation of winning 11 of the rally’s 19 stages. However, he failed to cancel the deficit behind Greensmith as competitive mileage dwindled yesterday in the 74km-long final day’s action.

Solberg posted the fastest time in the Wolf Power Stage, extending his lead in the championship. He finished more than seven minutes clear of third-placed Fabia man Kajetan Kajetanowicz, who also took the spoils in WRC2 Challenger.

“I don’t know what I’m more proud of, whether not giving up on Friday, or winning the category of the rally,” Greensmith said at the end.

“It's been a long week but I'm really, really happy. I say thank you to the (Toksport) team this weekend, they've been perfect.”

Safari Rally debutants Nicolas Ciamin and Charles Munster placed fourth and fifth respectively, both driving Hyundai i20 N Rally2 cars. Behind them was Daniel Chwist, followed by local driver Carl Tundo, winner in the WRC Masters Cup contingent.

Greensmith took full advantage of the mighty lead he’d built over the previous day, taking minimal risks to avoid damaging his tyres on Kenya’s rock-strewn roads. He dropped time to his Toksport Škoda Fabia RS Rally2 team-mate Oliver Solberg, who was hampered by tyre troubles on Friday, across all but one stage but still reached the overnight halt 1m 55.0s clear of the Swede.

“It's been fine today, I am feeling better now,” Greensmith confirmed.

“We took the last one nice and easy because we knew it was going to be rough, and it made no sense to lose time changing a tyre. Nothing was more physically demanding than yesterday - today, in comparison, was a walk in the park.”

Thinking of visiting someone? Think twice,"“Caro, you have to write about what happened to me last Sunday,” a colleague greeted me almost immediately after I walked into the office. Ladies and gentlemen, sustaining a column for over 10 years is not easy, especially when readers, (and your employer) expect you to write about a ‘fresh’ topic every week.

I therefore get excited when family, friends, colleagues, and even readers, give me ideas for my next column. I therefore braked immediately and headed to her desk. I stopped so abruptly, that if was I driving a car, the car behind me would have rear-ended me.

So here’s what happened to her. Last Sunday, it was past 1pm, she informed me, she received a phone call. She thought twice about picking up the call because she was exhausted, and all that she wanted to do that day was switch between watching TV and taking naps on the sofa.

Her son had had a road accident a few weeks before and had fractured an arm. He was, therefore, unable to do the chores he normally did, such as cooking and cleaning, when his mother worked late, which was often.

After weeks of working a whole day and then returning home to chores, my colleague was tired and wanted to just sit and do nothing on that day. Reluctantly, she decided to pick up the call. It was a nephew calling her, “Auntie, niko hapa chini, soldier amesema uko kwasababu gari yako iko parking…” The young man informed her that he was downstairs, and was sure that she was in the house because the watchman had informed him her car was still in the parking lot. How would you react to such a final statement?

My colleague felt her blood pressure begin to rise, and so many things went through her mind, including how she would slowly kill the watchman later.

Feeling trapped, she informed her nephew that yes, she was in. She lives on the second floor of an apartment building and figured that by the time her surprise visitor cleared the two flights of stairs, she would have changed out of her nightdress. When she opened the door to admit the young man, she got the surprise of her life. Standing next to him wearing a sheepish smile on her face was a young woman she had never seen holding an infant in her arms.

He would later introduce her as his wife – she had given birth to their child three months ago. “We’re from church, my wife suggested that we come visit you since she keeps hearing about you but has never met you,” he explained, even though, my colleague said, she suspects that this was a lie since the young woman quickly looked down in embarrassment following this statement.

To cut a long story short, being a typical African, she went to the kitchen and prepared them a meal since she and her son had already had lunch.

She served them, while trying very hard, being the host, to keep the conversation going since she and her nephew were not especially close and therefore unfamiliar with what was going on in each other’s lives, while she knew nothing about his new wife. It was an awkward afternoon that spilt into the late evening since her surprise visitors were in no hurry to leave.

When they finally bade her goodbye a few minutes to 7 pm, my colleague collapsed on the sofa from physical and mental exhaustion and blacked out, coming to at around 10pm, after which she dragged herself to bed, already dreading Monday.

Her appeal was short, “Please tell people that it is rude and inconsiderate to turn up on people’s doorsteps unannounced.”

Growing up in the rural area, it was common for neighbours to visit one another at all hours of the day without announcing it, but I guess that then, it was acceptable because the said visitors did not expect a buffet and would not begrudge you if you served them ‘strong tea’ or tea without sugar and would be totally fine with a glass of cold water. Things are different in urban areas though, as many put it, “Maisha hapa ni ngumu”.

Everything is budgeted for, this, coupled with the fact that everyone is busy trying to make a living, such visits are frowned on. So please, if you’re not especially close to the one you plan to ‘surprise’ this Sunday after church, think twice.

Learn to choose your battles wisely in your love life,"Some people cope well with life’s irritations while others panic. Don’t be one of those. The stress will eventually ruin your health, your career and your relationships. Instead, recognise which battles you should fight, and which you shouldn’t and learn to react better to setbacks.

So any time you feel an argument coming on, ask yourself whether the situation is really important enough for a confrontation. And whatever you do, don’t start getting riled up until you’ve decided how to deal with the issue because not all problems are equal. Some don’t matter at all, especially in the long run, while some seem crucial at the time, but the emotional effort involved is too great.

Only fight battles where the benefits outweigh the costs. Which never includes fighting with someone who is going to be out of your life anyway in a few minutes! And as writer Dale Carnegie said, ‘picking your battles is impressive.’

This is because if you only confront people over important issues, you’ll be taken seriously, while if you fight over everything you’ll just be seen as a troublemaker. So start reframing minor irritations.

Like seeing an annoying delay as a chance to relax, instead of a waste of time. And by asking whether the situation really is that critical.

Will it matter in a year’s time? Almost certainly not. Recognise that most events are insignificant, so it’s how you react to them that really counts. Try agreeing more in arguments. You may learn something, and your relationships will definitely improve. If you’re being criticised, try agreeing with the criticism. You’ll stop feeling insulted and there won’t be an argument.

When faced with a problem you can’t solve, or are afraid of, start by tackling it in short bursts. Your subconscious will work on the problem in the background, and the solution will likely just pop into your head. Or maybe you’re just a perpetual worrier? Don’t try to suppress your worries.

Instead, give them your full attention for five minutes, and then decide to put them aside and revisit them at a specific time later. Postponing your worries means you’re controlling them, rather than letting them control you.

Not sweating the small stuff is especially important in relationships because if you’re endlessly arguing about small stuff, like tidying the bathroom, then that’s probably a sign that your relationship may not work out.

Only fight battles that have serious, long-term implications, let everything else go, and learn to enjoy the differences between you because most relationships aren’t ended by a single incident, instead, they’re slowly swamped by endless mindless bickering.

It is therefore important to figure out what your triggers are, and decide to ignore them. Learn what really annoys your partner, and stop doing it.

Learn how to compromise gracefully, and as in all the other aspects of your life, focus your energy into identifying what the real problems are and fixing them. And leave the small stuff to take care of itself, you will be much happier, and so will your spouse.

But instead of the crisp morning air you crave, you are greeted by a thick, acrid mix of exhaust fumes and smoke that sends you into a coughing fit. Annoyance prickles at you – is this the air you must breathe daily?

This experience is all too familiar for Mary Njoki, a resident of Mathare slums. The community health promoter has been tethered to an inhaler for the past five years. ""I cannot leave the house without it,"" she says.

Mary's troubles began when she opened a roadside stall near a matatu drop-off point in Mathare. At the market, proper waste disposal and burning were non-existent, adding to the noxious air. Daily, she inhaled a toxic cocktail of dust and vehicle exhaust.

A new report jointly launched by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) shows that heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) such as trucks and buses are heavy emitters. Kenya is the second largest exporter of HDVs in East Africa after Burundi.

""If you have ever walked behind a big heavy truck, you may have smelled the nasty fumes billowing from its exhaust. Now, imagine standing next to such fumes all day?"" She sighs. ""I remember that the issue of polluted air was a constant conversation among us roadside sellers, and we wondered how long we would breathe the polluted air. I didn't know it would scar me for life,"" she says.

WHO estimates that seven million people die prematurely yearly due to air pollution, with half of this due to outdoor air pollution.

Her health issues began with a persistent cough and chest pains. Despite multiple trips to the hospital and treatment for recurring respiratory infections, the 62-year-old was ultimately diagnosed with asthma, a lung condition that makes breathing more difficult. Her doctor prescribed an inhaler and advised her to either relocate her business or cease operations altogether to preserve her health. She ultimately chose to close her shop and transitioned to working full-time as a health promoter.

Back home, the situation was the same. The smoke from her charcoal stove, a common feature in many Kenyan households, stung her eyes and irritated her throat. Lower-income groups in Nairobi's informal settlements like Mathare, where Mary lives, heavily rely on solid fuels like charcoal, classified as dirty fuels that release pollutants like smoke and dust when burnt.

""After many months of saving, I switched to cooking with gas, and I advocate for the same to the residents here,"" she says. Mary and other women under Groots Kenya work to raise awareness about cleaner cooking alternatives and reduce air pollution in the slums.

Yet, Mary's story isn't unique. Across Kenya, various towns are grappling with their own air pollution cocktails. Multiple studies reveal a rapid decline in outdoor air quality, raising health concerns.

Recently, IQAir released 2023's World Air Quality Report, finding that millions of people live with and breathe polluted air. The report ranks 134 countries across 7,748 locations using data from over 30,000 air quality monitoring stations around the globe. WHO estimates that seven million people die prematurely yearly due to air pollution, with half of this due to outdoor air pollution.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) measures air pollution to understand its severity. This index considers various pollutant concentrations and assigns a numerical value. Higher AQIs indicate greater air pollution and potential health risks.

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies PM2.5 fine particulate matter as the most hazardous pollutant as it gets deep into our lungs and causes health problems. Measured in micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³), PM2.5 is one of the six common pollutants monitored and regulated by environmental agencies worldwide due to the significant impacts on human health and the environment. Other pollutants include ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and lead). According to WHO, air is healthiest when these particles are below 5 µg/m3. That's like saying there should be less than five tiny specks in every breath of air you take throughout the year.

Moses Njeru, an air quality researcher at the University of Nairobi, terms air pollution as a lurking danger. Vehicle emissions, industrial facilities, burning waste and dust storms contribute to this toxic mix.

""PM2.5 fine particulate matter are particles a fraction the size of human hair that can be inhaled and often find their way into the deep lungs and even the bloodstream. Studies have shown links to strokes, heart diseases, neurological diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and other health-related conditions,"" he offers.

The pollutants, he says, can come from various sources, including vehicle emissions, industrial facilities, burning waste, and dust storms.

PM2.5 particles, caused mainly by fossil fuel emissions, affect human health and environmental processes like climate change. Only 10 of 134 countries met WHO's annual PM2.5 guidelines in 2023.

IQAir ranked Nairobi as the 79th most polluted city globally. Bangladesh is the world's most polluted country, while Burkina Faso is the most polluted in Africa. The report is based on data from 24 out of 54 Sub-Saharan African countries, indicating the need for more comprehensive air quality insights.

""Five cities in Kenya met the criteria for inclusion in the 2023 World Air Quality Report. ""Data shows improved PM2.5 levels in Nakuru, Kapsabet and Nairobi over the past year. This year marks the fourth consecutive year for PM2.5 improvements in the capital city of Nairobi, which boasts the second-largest network coverage of air quality monitors among African cities,"" says Dr Christi Chester-Schroeder, an air quality science manager.

Here is the not-so-good news: only about nine per cent of cities worldwide have clean air. IQAir found that the cities with the worst air were New Delhi, Dhaka, Ouagadougou, Dushanbe, and Baghdad. Capitals with the lowest concentrations of PM2.5 were mainly in Oceania, Scandinavia and the Caribbean.

A recent Clean Air Fund report warns that without crucial urban development interventions, the economic cost of air pollution in six rapidly growing cities, including Nairobi, could reach a staggering Sh19 trillion by 2040.

Mr Njeru and his team from the University of Nairobi have deployed air quality monitors across Kenya to verify air quality data. ""Given the diverse micro-environments, we need comprehensive data,"" he explains. Monitors are placed in residential areas, suburbs, industrial zones, forested areas, and the central business district (CBD) to capture pollution variations.

The verdict: Kenyans are breathing unsafe air. Research reveals ""hotspots""—areas with elevated PM2.5 pollution, particularly in high-traffic zones, informal settlements and industrial regions. The CBD experiences spikes during rush hour. ""Our research, in particular, shows the guidelines have exceeded even three times in some areas,"" he says.

While PM2.5 poses direct health risks, Moses says its implications extend beyond human health to climate change, which is primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions.

""For centuries, air pollution has been a silent killer. It was not until the Great London Smog of the 1950s that enough noise was made after thousands of people died prematurely in Europe. This led to a call for regulation and the birth of the famous Clean Air Act, whose mission was to control common pollutants,"" says the researcher.

"Trump can't match Biden's 2024 fundraising, Republican's campaign says","Donald Trump will be unable to match President Joe Biden's fundraising totals in this year's presidential election race, the Republican candidate's campaign said on Thursday.

""We're never gonna be able to raise dollar for dollar with Biden,"" a Trump campaign adviser said in a call with reporters.

The adviser blamed the fundraising disparity on ""billionaire"" supporters of the Democratic president, and appeared keen to paint a picture of a Trump campaign fueled by grassroots, working-class supporters.

A second campaign adviser said Trump's campaign is ""fueled by hundreds of thousands of grassroots contributors across the country, and I'd much rather have that because each one of those votes.""

Asked for a response, Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said: ""Trump's campaign is strapped for cash.""

Democratic candidates have raised more money in support of their White House bids than their Republican counterparts in all election cycles after 2004. Money, however is not always an indication of success; Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though she raised far more cash than he did.

Biden has been routinely outraising former President Trump, whose campaign, together with a joint fundraising committee, pulled in $20.3 million in February compared with the more than $53 million raised by Biden's reelection effort that month.

Large contributions make up about 55% of the $128.7 million that Biden's campaign committee has raised so far in the election cycle, OpenSecrets data showed, compared with 45% from small contributions.

For Trump, large contributions comprise 64% of the $96.1 million his campaign committee has raised, versus 36% from small contributions.

The two face a Nov. 5 general election rematch, in a race that opinion polls suggest will be extremely close.

Biden was holding a star-studded fundraiser in New York on Thursday night with his Democratic predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton that his campaign said has already raised $25 million.

The Trump campaign is due to hold a fundraiser on April 6 hosted by billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson in south Florida that aims to bring in $33 million, according to a person familiar with the event.

The Trump advisers on Thursday said that together with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will be opening dozens of offices and hiring hundreds of staff in the next few weeks, as they ramp up their general election infrastructure now that Trump has become the Republican Party's presidential candidate.

Trump cemented his grip over the RNC in March when a loyalist, his daughter-in-law, and a senior campaign adviser were installed as chair, co-chair and chief of staff of the organization following his endorsement. An aggressive overhaul ensued, with dozens of employees losing their jobs.

As part of the leadership restructuring, a new slate of deputies will focus on battleground states as well as relationships with state parties and grassroots organizations, the second Trump campaign adviser said. Gone are regional directors who oversaw broad areas of the country.

""Folks that are focused on the battleground states will have a very narrow focus,"" the adviser said. ""We will not have that sort of middle layer that has historically existed to oversee a large region.""

Mantalk: The milestones that matter in a man’s life,"I have always been a late bloomer. I come late. This is a great thing if you are in bed with a woman, but a terrible thing at the workplace. Anyway, I broke my voice in Form One, but thankfully that was cancelled out by me being a rather funny fellow, claiming I had Nigerian roots, and was descended from the Hausa tribe, with my great grandfather moving to Kenya in the early 1900s. I couldn’t prove I was, but, crucially, they couldn’t prove I wasn’t.

That’s not all. My moustache and goatee started growing in Form Two, and by then I knew girls liked their men, men. If you didn’t have a beard or showed no visible signs of growing one, they would practise what Jesus recommended, looking the other way. But because God cannot tempt you beyond what you can bear, I told them good beards are like good Hip Hop. They are underground. They laughed. Turns out, if you make a girl laugh, you are halfway into her heart (or bank account, right Effie?)

Read: Mantalk: Why men are not believed when they turn down sex offer

I remember the first time I saw a guy shave his beard in high school. His name was Mark but we used to call him MtuSaba, styled as ‘Mtu7’. He was not the sharpest tool as evidenced by the eventual grade Mr Kaimenyi handed him, but my God, he could rap.

He channelled all his inner seven personalities, and when he was on stage, it was like a demon let loose at a holy rite. Women wanted to be with him; men wanted to be him. Where was I? Oh, yes. Mtu7 came to school with Veet (remember Veet?) and he applied it and voila! Like magic, his stubble was gone. I was under his spell for the rest of that term. I spent most of the days with his other bearded fellows. Grown men. I think those men were hired by the school under the guise of ‘students’ to represent us in the National School Games. Some may have done a little time back in the day. Some definitely could—and would—kick your ass, should your ass be in need of kicking.

When I bought my first shaver, it had me in a chokehold. I believed this was the bridge between teenage and adulthood. And then I realised that pencil-thin moustache, looking like a broke Salvador Dalí is not what girls like, so I said no way Jose! and shaved it all. Nothing screams adult! more than the ability to safely take a sharp object to your face every day.

But then I went to campus and I had a growth spurt. After the silence of my adolescence, now it seemed that even the ghosts were shouting, demanding to be heard. It seemed like I grew overnight, suddenly I had more freedom than sense, and I was responsible for myself.

After class, I’d offer, being a gentleman and true to my Kakamega roots to sindikiza my girl friends (note the space between girl and friends, which marks the friend zone) back to their rooms. And then they would invite me in but I would tell them I come from a long line of Rastafarian Anglicans and besides, doesn’t the school law state that male students are not allowed in female hostels during the 10 to 10 curfew? The girls would look at me, and smile strangely. I am sorry Stephanie; I was young and naïve! Please call me!

Read: Mantalk: Men, quit complaining, it’s time to take personal responsibility

Campus passed by in a whiz, and I was thrown full-blown into adulting. I got my first proper paycheck after nodding furiously when I said I could work under extreme pressure—UNSUPERVISED. I celebrated it by tithing ten per cent. The rest of the money not even KRA can waterboard me to reveal what happened to it. With an up-and-at-'em attitude, I had an “anything goes” approach to life. But, boy I had fun. Fun was had. Broke, binge-drinking, and impressionable—the hallmarks of a life still under construction.

And then came the big one. I met a girl. And not just any girl. A girl with the whole world behind her—a behind that could lead to a Damascene conversion, one that deserves its own personality trait. But turns out nyash can get you to the table, but it won’t keep you at the table.

Ah, the promised land. When she dumped me in the middle of June (in that cold!), I almost went berserk. I promised to never love a woman again. I cursed women. I pledged chastity. I swore off romance. But what is life? A few months later I met another and another and another and by this time, my heart had cauterised enough that I could handle rejection. A milestone.

I have been thinking lately about milestones. How quickly “these days” turn to “those days”.

Read: Mantalk: Why do more women want to act like men?

Milestones that define your transitions from one stage to the next. Every major milestone a man achieves in his life starts with getting something all on his own. All things that some—well, most—men secretly yearn for and snigger over but understand are aesthetically, socially, intellectually, and tastefully indefensible: Fast cars. Women. Women in fast cars. Getting women in fast cars pregnant. Because when it comes to success, every man makes his way at his own pace.

Often we never sit to stop and look at that rearview mirror, and thank God, the universe, or whatever it is fills the void in your soul. We are focused on acquiring the next success object, going to the next shiny toy, and climbing the next rung of social stairs.

While these do create an illusion of success and growth, the one thing that matters most is, what milestones are you chasing to grow as a man of character. Do you still have the same tardiness? Distractions? Vices? I have often looked to Hunter S. Thompson in my manhood journey, to shine a light on my dark path. “A man has to BE something; he has to matter,” Hunter says. “But a man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance. But beware of looking for goals; look for a way of life. To let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life— the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.”

It’s not the only milestone, but it is the only one that matters most. Even if you are a late bloomer.

The secret to a happy union,"There is a clear unwritten script on this marriage story. This is how it goes, you graduate from college, get a decent job, buy household stuff, join a Sacco, take a loan then buy your first car.

And life starts on a good note...

Next are wedding plans. Your potential partner has a decent job like you and is ready to settle.

If you are a woman, you look for a decent man — solid and God-fearing. Equally, if you are a man, you want a quality woman.

But here is the interesting part. You make sure you ‘sanitise’ your image so that when the potential partner finds you, you are “squeaky clean”.

You stop your reckless nightlife of drinking and partying and turn into a faithful church person. Then the paths for this “good” man and “godly” woman meet and marriage happens.

That is how Kenyan men and women prepare for marriage.

And there is more...

The ruracio lost its cultural significance and what is left is a display of a facade and exploitation to milk as much money as possible from the groom’s side.

Extravagant wedding

The groom then feels exploited and in turn, treats his wife like one of his possessions. After all, he paid dearly for her.

You start life on that wrong foundation. Baby number one checks in after that extravagant wedding that left you so broke you will need a decade to recover.

By the time the third baby is checking in, you have lost yourselves in the script. You fight a lot, are disillusioned and have no shared values or purpose.

As a coping mechanism, one of you starts to have an affair — the man, simply because he can lead the Bible study and still get away with adultery. But society will judge an adulterous woman harshly.

Slowly, betrayal sets in and the marriage starts to collapse.

If you are Christians, divorce is not an option and you may not warm up to counselling. And that is how many marriages end because they started on a wrong footing.

The script left out the most important secret ingredient of a joyous marriage — friendship.

And my readers agree with this:

“You are supposed to marry your friend, someone you connect with and whose company you enjoy. Love grows from there,” Josiah K, a reader says.

Emotional connection

Friendship, he notes, is the glue that binds the bond of marriage.

“Friendship is what strengthens emotional connection and intimacy.”

After two decades of marriage, Josiah says he is more in love with his wife because they were first friends.

“We were friends, then fell in love. Our friendship has continued to grow over the years, which has strengthened our love.”

Grace Mueni dishes out a brutal truth.

“Stop jumping into sex before marriage as it closes the door to emotional connection and does not give you time to know the other person. Friendship is what makes a marriage worth it,” Grace says.

She gives an example of an elderly couple who are friends and have grown closer over the years.

They have gone through the rough patches of life together and still laugh about it. They immensely enjoy each other’s company.

Indeed, meeting someone, growing a beautiful friendship together through the highs and lows of life, is what will set a solid foundation for a marriage that will stand the test of time.

DTB raises dividend as profit grows to Sh6.8bn,"DTB Group raised its dividend payout to a record of Sh6 per share for the year ended December when its net profit grew 13.4 percent to Sh6.8 billion on higher interest and transaction-based income.

The company had paid a dividend of Sh5 per share for the prior year. The new dividend, amounting to a total payout of Sh1.6 billion, will be distributed on June 28 to shareholders who will be on record as of May 24.

The dividend represents a payout of 24.3 percent of the net income in the review period, rising from 23 percent in the prior year when the lender posted a net profit of Sh6 billion.

DTB had earlier announced that it would be making incremental dividend payouts comprising the distribution of a higher percentage of rising earnings.



The payout ratio has risen from 21.4 percent in 2021 when the dividend per share was Sh3 and the net income stood at Sh3.9 billion.

“Going forward, we will continue to progressively increase the dividend payout ratio, on the back of an improving performance by your bank as well as ensuring that there is an equitable balance between rewarding shareholders and conserving capital to fund the ambitious growth aspirations of the Group,” DTB said in its 2022 annual report.

DTB is among the listed lenders that raised their dividends to record levels in the latest full year earnings announcements, joining Standard Chartered Bank Kenya, Absa Bank Kenya, Stanbic Holdings and I&M Group and NCBA Group.

DTB’s profit growth in the year ended December was driven by higher income from transactions as well as lending to the government and ordinary customers.

Net interest income, for instance, rose 20.4 percent to Sh27.5 billion. Non-interest income including fees and commissions meanwhile increased 34.2 percent to Sh12.1 billion.

The jump in interest income came as the bank’s loan expanded 54.7 percent to Sh308.4 billion. DTB saw its interest income from government securities rise 29.1 percent to Sh24.1 billion despite reducing its investment in the assets to Sh120.1 billion from Sh133.1 billion.

This reflects the impact of rising interest rates on bonds and T-bills last year.

DTB grew its deposits to Sh486 billion from Sh387.5 billion, a move that contributed to its interest expenses jumping to Sh25.7 billion from Sh17.1 billion.

Banks have seen their cost of funds rise in line with the increase in interest rates, with the average deposit rate standing at 10.18 percent in January 2024 from a low of 7.47 percent in the same month last year.

DTB’s operating expenses surged 39.7 percent to Sh30.8 billion on increased loan loss provisions, staff costs and other items.

Its provision for bad debt went up by Sh3.1 billion to Sh10.3 billion as the stock of non-performing loans expanded by Sh11.4 billion to Sh43.6 billion.

Night and day at the Bamba Restaurant,"It was last Saturday. After an enjoyable concert performed by the Nairobi Orchestra at the Braeside School, Lut and I had been invited to attend the concert and afterward, have a late meal at the Bamba Restaurant on Amboseli Road in Lavington.

All four of us were in a good mood after the concert, so we were not at all put out by the happy chatter at the surrounding tables as we found our reserved seats.

That was our first impression of the place – busy and lively.

Open for only five months, the restaurant is clearly doing something very right. It was just as well that our friends had reserved a table; in the morning I had gone on the internet to see how the place had described itself, and I saw that it was fully booked for the evening.

The EatOut review calls the restaurant a ‘hidden gem’. It’s a cliché that makes sense.

It is difficult to find along Amboseli Road, because the only sign is the word ‘Bamba’, written small on a black gate.

If you haven’t been there yet, and if this review tempts you to go, the restaurant is almost opposite the Amboseli Road turn-off to Amboseli Lane.

The cuisine is Lebanese. For starters, we shared two of them: the fire-roasted mushrooms, served with tahini yoghurt, and then Rakakat: crispy fried pastry rolls, stuffed with feta and mozzarella cheese and shatta sauce – made of pounded chilies. The mushrooms were, as my sister used to say, ‘more-ish’.

Bamba’s clientele

For me, the ‘more’ was the Sokaf: marinated beef tenderloin cubes, served with tzatziki – a creamy cucumber sauce. Again, delicious.

It was too dark for a good photograph, so that was a good excuse to see Bamba in Sunday daylight and sample the lunch menu. I’m glad I did; I now have a more rounded story to tell.

The restaurant adjoins an old Lavington house; one half has walls and the other half is open, and both have a translucent cover.

The décor matches the cuisine. A huge mural on a wall at right angles to the long bar is of the Hamsa hand. Google tells me that it is a universal sign of protection, power, and strength that dates back to ancient Mesopotamia – situated roughly where Iraq is today.

It is known as the Hand of Fatima in Islam and the Hand of Miriam in Judaism, and it is believed to protect against the evil eye and all negative energies.

The mid-day Sunday clientele tended to be older, quieter and more mixed than that of the late Saturday evening.

There were small groups of expats, a few from the Middle East and a good number of Kenyan couples and families with young children.

For my lunch, I chose the Halloumi: grilled cubes of mozzarella-type cheese, served with fried cherry tomatoes, black olives and fresh herbs. It was hot, very tasty, and the halloumi was fried just right – firm and not stringy.

Reasonable prices

I was also able to enjoy a dessert that had been sold out the previous evening – the small Pineapple Puff doughnuts, stuffed with pineapple rum jam and served with the Middle-Eastern ashta cream.

Across the food and drinks menus, the prices are very reasonable.

There was time to have a chat with Francis Njuguna, the young restaurant manager.

I was impressed by the music that was playing, and he told me that they have live music sessions on Sundays and that Sunday it was Makadem, with his blend of Bengla and Ohangla music.

I had watched Francis at work; sometimes he was talking with the barman when he was mixing the popular cocktails; sometime he was carrying plates. He is a hands-on manager and he is a good talker.

I asked him about Bamba’s usual clientele.

""All sorts of people,"" he said. ""And that is how we want it.""

If you would like to join them, remember to book, and also remember that the restaurant is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. You can find out more on Instagram.

Here is how to improve your child’s emotional Intelligence,"Good emotional intelligence is one of the keys to success in life. Leading to more friends, better relationships and better careers, so it makes sense to help your children improve theirs.

But there’s a limit to what you can do, so don’t stress over it because a lot of it is their genes, and much of the rest comes from the way they interact with their buddies.

Think of the way your kids pick up the latest slang from their schoolmates! But there’s still a lot you can do, especially when they’re very small.

And it’s worth it, because it will help them to resolve conflict, manage their own feelings and cope with the emotions of others.

They’ll also understand the differences between them and their friends better, and develop greater resilience.

Children need structure in their lives, so a good starting point is having consistent rules around the house, high expectations for their behaviour, and family rules on politeness and chores.

Dealing with negative emotions

Be a good role model, because they pay far more attention to what you’re doing than what you say.

Show them your values in the way you live your life, like being honest and kind. Show them how to put things right when you or they make a mistake.

Help your children to notice their own emotions and to be able to talk about them, by discussing the emotions of the characters in books, movies and TV shows.

‘Why do you think she’s crying?’ ‘Why do you think he felt that way?’

That teaches them that others have the same kinds of feelings as they do, and helps them to build empathy.

Help them to deal with their negative emotions, like fear and frustration. And resist the urge to jump in anytime you see them struggling, because allowing them to learn from their difficulties will help them grow more confident, resilient and self-reliant.

Coach them by all means, but always taking over your child’s problem for them sends the message that they aren’t capable of doing it themselves.

Emotional and social skills

Modern society is becoming highly risk averse, and that’s resulted in children’s lives being hugely restricted. Think of all the adventures you had as a child, which our children are denied.

And that matters, because children who’ve never fallen are more likely to be afraid of heights as adults, for example.

So gradually let your children discover risks and dangers, and how to manage them for themselves.

It’s also important for kids to have plenty of unsupervised, unguided play, as this gives them the chance to practice emotional and social skills with their peers, without adult guidance. Like how to support a friend in need, or to negotiate a conflict.

Help them to develop the belief that they’re in control of their own lives. Help them to be more optimistic, and to believe in their own abilities.

One day, you’ll have the pleasure of seeing them going out on their own, as successful adults.

Trump says he would take 'appropriate action' over Prince Harry visa question,"Former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said if Prince Harry lied on his visa application about drug-taking Trump would seek to take ""appropriate action"" if he won November's presidential election, declining to rule out Harry leaving the United States.

Trump's comments to British right-leaning media outlet GB News came in an interview with presenter and frequent Harry critic Nigel Farage.

U.S. visa applicants are required to make a disclosure about any history of drug use, which can impact their application. Lying on an application can result in penalties including deportation.

Harry, who has lived in California since 2020, admitted to past illegal drug use in his memoir ""Spare,"" after which conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation sued the U.S. Homeland Security Department to access his immigration records. Earlier this month, a judge ruled in that case that the details pertaining to Harry's visa application should be handed over to court.

Farage, a long-time Trump ally, asked the Republican presidential candidate if Prince Harry should receive any ""special privileges"" if he lied in his application.

""No. We'll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they'll have to take appropriate action,"" Trump replied.

When asked if that might mean Harry ""not staying in America,"" the former president replied: ""Oh I don't know. You'll have to tell me. You just have to tell me. You would have thought they would have known this a long time ago.""

Since Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle left royal duties and moved to California, they have often railed at their treatment by Britain's royal family.

From an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021 to a Netflix documentary series and Harry's book, the couple have asserted that the royals and their aides failed to protect them from a hostile press and leaked negative stories about them.

The couple, who married in 2018, have rarely returned to Britain since their departure for the United States.

Road deaths: The buck stops with Murkomen,"In recent weeks, our country has been engulfed by a dark cloud of sorrow caused by an upsurge in road carnages that must get us all worried.

This year alone, the grim statistics on the number of fatalities, major and minor injuries that have caused a blot on many families are mind-blowing.

Motorcyclists, pedestrians, passengers, drivers and pedal cyclists have all been affected. It is always painfully regretful to see the sight of a person writhing in excruciating pain due to a disaster that was otherwise avoidable.

This week, a student and a teacher lost their precious lives hours after occupants of another school bus cheated death at the notorious Nithi bridge thanks to their driver’s quick thinking.

The buck stops with the Ministry of Transport, headed by Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen, and its agency, the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA). They must stop at nothing than taming the accident and assuring Kenyans of their safety on the roads because many accidents are, more often than not, as a result of human error.

First, they must rid our roads of unroadworthy vehicles. All vehicles must be fitted with safety belts, speed governors and occasionally serviced.

Secondly, drivers, especially those of school buses must be licensed and experienced. Drink-driving, speeding, dangerous overtaking, driving while using mobile gadgets, among other misbehaviour, must be frowned upon, violators of all traffic rules must be made to face the full force of the law expeditiously. Thirdly, the authority must also ensure roads are well maintained and labeled appropriately to guide motorists.

We must do everything possible to keep our roads safe to alleviate further suffering.

On Monday, 11 students perished following an accident in Maungu, Taita Taveta County, involving a Kenyatta University that was taking them to an academic trip in Mombasa. Witnesses said the bus collided with a trailer.

Experts reveal why some pawpaws are sweeter than others,"Last week, there was a heated debate in the newsroom about pawpaws. The pawpaw, also known as papaya in English and mpapai (the tree) and papai (the fruit) in Swahili, is considered one of Kenyan scientists' most important fruit plants. Its scientific name is Carica papaya.

The pawpaw originated in lowland areas of Central and South America. Still, over the years, it has been cultivated in most warm regions of the world.

Fresh fruits are essential sources of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre, crucial in food security and human nutrition.

Journalists at the Nation's Health Desk debated which pawpaw was the sweetest and most nutritious. They wanted to know which one to recommend to their readers.

Keywords: Food for thought: Eating healthy is costly, but there are cheap options

""Nipe ile tamu kabisaa"" is what you are likely to say to your 'Mama Mboga' when buying a fruit.

I asked an expert which pawpaw was the sweetest and most nutritious. After all, who doesn't love healthy sweet things?

Jackson Makori, a fruit vendor in Gachie, Kiambu County, has been selling fruit for 15 years. He says that, as far as he knows, the sweetest pawpaws are found in Meru and Kitui counties.

Dr Patrick Maundu, a Kenyan ethnobotanist who has dedicated his life to the  research of indigenous knowledge on African biodiversity in health and nutrition gave some pointers.

""Sweetness in fruit evolved for good reason which is to attract animals that can feed on it and therefore cause dispersal of seeds in the fruit,"" said Dr Maundu who has been with the National Museums of Kenya since 1989 and now heads the Kenya Resource Centre For Indigenous Knowledge (Kenrik).

""When you cut the pawpaw and find that it has no seed, that's most likely a male fruit. They are usually seedless and not sweet because sweetness will not serve any function,"" Dr Maundu said.

""Pawpaw trees exist in three forms: female, male, and self-pollinating or hermaphrodite, hence regarded as trioecious. Female plants require pollen from male or self-pollinating plants, but male plants are more effective at passing their pollen to female flowers,"" he says.

""Self-pollinating plants tend to have the sweetest fruits because they don't rely on pollen from elsewhere and are, therefore, the most effective in propagating the species. Pollen is mainly brought by wind or insects.

The ethnobotanist explains that hermaphrodite plants have both female and male parts in the same flower, and the fruit tends to have a pear shape.

According to Dr Maundu, male pawpaw trees are easier to pick out from pawpaw plants than bisexual and female ones.

This is because their flowers are slender, with most having one long, pendulous stalk.

""They lack the female parts, or the pistil with stigma, except in a few cases of pistil-bearing flowers at the farthest flowers. Female pawpaw plants, on the other hand, have fewer but larger flowers that are borne singly or in small clusters,"" the expert notes, adding that their stalks are short, so they cluster next to the pawpaw plant.

Dr Maundu says his study of the plant has found that Kenyan farmers prefer the self-pollinating pawpaw, even if they don't know it.

This is not only because they are the sweetest but also because they are more productive in terms of yields, as every tree will produce fruit. ​

Dolphin tours and the beauty of Wasini Island,"The idyllic island of Wasini, which stretches about seven kilometres long and is located 76 kilometres south of Mombasa, is the final pearl in the tropical beach necklace.

With its faded white alleyways, a fishing vibe inspired by Swahili culture, and fat mottled trees, this tiny island feels like a distant relative of Lamu and Zanzibar.

It is perfect for any backpacker looking for a beachside hideaway. In other words, it has that sit-under-a-Mugumo-tree-and-do-nothing-all-day-vibe.

A coastline littered with pockets of white sand and the Kisite Marine National Park is just a few hundred meters away, with a crystal clear beach where dolphins come to show off.

The abundance of boats on the dock provides an extremely picturesque view – a photographer’s paradise.

In fact, the only things Wasini lacks is regular electricity, banana-pancake traveler cafes, and backpacker hostels.

Cars and bicycles are a handful, (count yourself lucky if you spot one), but it is all the better for it. The population here is about 3,000 people.

The sun scorching at 32 degrees should be a concern should you forget to pack sunscreen.

Must-see destination

It is here that I spent a few days on my recent voyage to the South Coast of Ukunda, having docked in Diani. The island offered much, both fun and history.

A story is told of the Wavumba people who arrived on Wasini in the 18th century having been forced onto the Island after being ousted by vicious, constant attacks from the Waode community of Dar es Salaam.

Under their leader, Diwan Ruga, Wavumba found a new home on Wasini Island.

Wasini Island is perfect for any backpacker looking for a beachside hideaway.

Wavumba traditions tell of the immense wealth Ruga amassed through business with Chinese merchants while on the Island. In fact, the name Wasini means ‘the Chinese people’.

Soon the Wavumba were joined on the island by Arabs hailing from Pemba and Zanzibar, and the Omanis landed on the island’s shores and set up a slave trade centre.

Today Wasini has grown into a must-see destination. I saw only a few local tourists who are aware of this gem that lies within our borders.

Every boat that cruised past or against ours ferried a huge number of foreigners, with only one or two Kenyans to be seen, who in most cases were water guards.

Jasmine Gardens Villas

To get to Wasini and access the Kisite Mpunguti Marine National Park, I had to pay Sh4,000 for this full-day voyage.

I stayed at the Jasmine Gardens Villas which boasts of well-manicured lawns and gardens that make you forget the heat strokes for a second.

Fitted with an outdoor private pool beautifully surrounded by a floral garden, the villa offered four bedrooms, three bathrooms and an attic (that sleeps four), spacious kitchen, living room, a backyard and ‘to die for’ Pagoda with three swing chairs that can seat seven.

We were just two in the villa, which can comfortably house between eight to 15 people. There is also a concierge service at your disposal.

From the Gardens it’s only nine minutes to Ukunda airport and six to the Diani beach ranked 22nd in the world by TripAdvisor and third in Africa.

It’s from here that I was picked by the transfer agent at 7am and driven for 45 minutes to Shimoni Jetty.

It would be clever of you to bring your own water to evade the exploitation of the local traders who will mercilessly charge you Sh500 for a one litre bottle of water.

Incredible Island

At Shimoni you will board an Arabic dhow, and spend an hour enjoying the breeze and oceanic views as you sail to Kisite Mpunguti, a perfect spot for snorkelling and scuba dives.

If you are lucky you will swim with the dolphins but for this day luck wasn’t on our side. Those who were lucky from previous trips, narrated how pods of dolphins escorted their Dhow.

However, for the thrill, we took a deep dive into the Island’s surrounding ocean capturing memories of the colour-rich and lively coral reef.

I couldn’t help but marvel at the schools of fish and green sea turtles swimming rhythmically.

I can attest the island is truly a diver’s bliss, the salty water isn’t too cold hence one can enjoy themselves for a fairly long time like we did until the salty waters became a nuisance.

Sailing back from Kisite we had to pass through two more islands, Mpunguti Chini and Mpunguti Juu. There are no inhabitants at Mpunguti Chini while only three people live on Mpunguti Juu. The three are rangers from Kenya Wildlife service protecting the Marine Park.

Whether you prefer to call it Lamu’s little sister, the jewel of the Indian Ocean or the Home of Dolphins, Wasini is an incredible Kenyan Island.

 ,"While sentencing Joseph Kuria Irungu alias Jowie to death for the murder of Monica Kimani, High Court judge Grace Nzioka said the killing was intentional and it was not as a result of provocation.

The judge added that it is not that Jowie did not have an opportunity to reflect on his actions before committing the offence because it was premeditated, planned and executed with subsequent destruction of evidence.

In the judge’s view, the offender deserves no mercy for what he had done to the victim.

After the death sentence what next for Jowie?

His lawyer Andrew Muge said he would appeal against both the sentence and the conviction, as provided for in law within 14 days from the date of the judgement.

According to Mr Muge, the prosecution failed to give exculpatory evidence (evidence that would have absolved him of the offence), including the photographs of a pair of shorts he allegedly wore on the night of September 19, 2018.

The lawyer said Jowie wore a pair of brown khaki shorts, with side pockets. But the one produced in court, and which linked him to the murder- as blood samples collected on it were Monica’s- were different.

He said DNA results found on the straps that were used to tie Monica, showed that there were two unknown males, who accessed the house.

Mr Muge further said they will also be raising the issue of the time recorded at the entrance to Lamuria Gardens Apartment. He said there was contradictory evidence as to whether he left the house at 9pm or 11pm.

Will Jowie face the hangman?

Kenya has not executed anyone on death row since 1987 when Hezekiah Ochuka and Pancras Oteyo Okumu were hanged for their role in the attempted coup.

Reports published by lobby groups, who have sought for the abolishment of the death penalty state that from independence in 1963 to 1987, only 280 persons out of 3,584 people sentenced to death, were executed in Kenya.

In 2009, President Mwai Kibaki commuted the sentences of more than 4,000 convicts from death to life imprisonment. His successor Uhuru Kenyatta commuted the sentences of another 2,747 in 2016 to life imprisonment.

Read: The mysterious life of Joseph 'Jowie’ Irungu

The latest commutations were done by President William Ruto in July last year, of all death sentences from November 21, 2022, to life imprisonment as recommended by the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (POMAC).

POMAC is chaired by Attorney General Justin Muturi and derives its powers from The Power of Mercy Act 2011, which allows the President to grant a free or conditional pardon to a person convicted of an offence.

What does the death sentence mean?

Death in Kenya is carried out by hanging. Under section 332(3) of the criminal procedure code, a death warrant must be issued and signed by the President for the death to be carried out. The warrant must also state the place and time of the execution. The death warrant must also provide directions as to the place of burial or cremation of the body of the person to be executed.

What other offences carry a death sentence?

The penal code imposes a death sentence for the offences of murder, treason, robbery with violence, attempted robbery with violence and administration of unlawful oaths to commit capital offences and the International Crimes Act.

Have there been attempts to abolish the death sentence?

Yes. Several human rights groups have argued for the abolishment of the death sentence. In 2017, the Supreme Court declared the mandatory nature of the death sentence unconstitutional. With the quashing of the section, judges hearing capital offences have the discretion to impose the sentence they deem appropriate after considering the gravity of the offence and the mitigation of the offender.

The top court judges said a person facing the death sentence is most deserving to be heard in mitigation because of the finality of the sentence.

Read: Why Kenya has not abolished the death penalty

What does a life sentence mean?

In Kenya, it is assumed that the life sentence means the number of years of the prisoner’s natural life, which ceases upon his or her death. Lobbyists, however, want this to be abolished and Parliament to come up with minimum and maximum sentences for serious offences such as murder, robbery with violence and attempted robbery with violence.

The lobby groups argue that a life sentence is also punitive and defeats the whole purpose of sending prisoners to jail- of rehabilitating them. They argue that keeping them in jail until they pass on, is also expensive given that a prisoner spends more money for their upkeep in prison.

The Supreme Court declined an invitation by two convicts to define what constitutes a life sentence. Instead, the six judges of the apex court (Justice Mohammed Ibrahim had been indisposed) directed the Attorney General and Parliament to commence an enquiry and develop legislation on the definition of what constitutes a life sentence.

What has Parliament done so far?

MPs have been mulling over abolishing the death sentence and replacing it with life imprisonment, by amending the Penal Code Act. The Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2023, pushed by the leader of majority in the National Assembly Opiyo Wandayi seeks to erase the imposition of the death sentence against capital offenders.

The Bill is currently before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) of the National Assembly for prepublication scrutiny.

Mr Wandayi said abolishing the death penalty will help to preserve the fundamental right to life under Article 26 of the Constitution and put an end to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment of condemned persons, occasioned by the enforcement of the death penalty. The MP added that the abolishment of the death penalty will also stop the psychological trauma that convicts go through.

Step up war on drugs and illicit liquors,"It is saddening to see people lose their lives from drugs and illicit liquor. According to the “2022 Report on the Status of Drugs and Substance Use” by the National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada) one in every 20 persons aged between 15 and 65 years were addicts.

That is why I support the government’s drive against drug and alcohol abuse spearheaded by the Interior ministry. An effective campaign will ensure that people become responsible. I fully agree with the Interior cabinet secretary, Prof Kithure Kindiki, to seize vehicles used to transport drugs and illicit liquor and houses in which they are manufactured, stored or sold and deem them as government property.

That will help in reducing the rate of road crashes and crime in the country, which are caused by drugs and illicit liquor. The government should also ensure more job opportunities are created to ensure every Kenyan is involved in constructive work that earns them an income.

That will also reduce idleness among the youth, which is the main cause of drug and alcohol abuse. It will also ensure that parents get time to raise their children responsibly. The government should also carry out campaigns to educate people about the adverse effects of drugs and liquor.

All should be aware of the consequences of a conviction for drug and illicit liquor abuse and trafficking. The courts should heavily punish those arrested for drug- and alcohol-related crimes to ensure that every citizen follows the law.

County commissioners and their deputies, as well as the chiefs, should be at the forefront to ensure the government strategies to fight drug and alcohol abuse and trafficking work successfully without fear or favour.

Citizens should collaborate fully with the government in this fight as they know where these drugs and alcohol are made and sold, whether in the towns or villages.

A reflection on street food culture in Kenya,"Last Saturday, I went to the second edition of the Nairobi Street Food Festival, organised by Little Africa Events and set up in the main arena of the ASK showground in Jamhuri.

I was rather disappointed; it wasn’t quite what I had expected.

I have some fond memories of street food. The most romantic, I suppose, was eating fish at informal stalls on the bank of the mighty Mekong River as it flowed past Vientiane, the capital city of Laos.

I was lucky to be there during Lai Heua Fai, the Festival of Light Boats. People make small boats of banana leaves and flowers, light them up with candles and float them on the river as darkness falls.

It is a way of paying homage to the spirit of the Mekong River, a provider of livelihoods for so many people.

Nearer home and without spiritual connotations, I enjoyed eating chicken on the roadside on the edge of Kabalagala, the place of nightspots in Kampala.

I was on a consultancy assignment and the team was staying at the Diplomate Hotel on Tank Hill, overlooking Kabalagala and the wider city.

Nairobi's street food scene

After a day’s work at the Ministry of Water, a few of us sometimes had our evening meal of chicken cooked on the roadside braziers.

We had beers brought out from the Telex Hotel just behind us. It was run by a formidable lady, and it got its name because it was known, during the years of conflict, as one of the best places in town for finding out what was really going on.

I have never enjoyed such riverside or roadside times in Nairobi. So I talked with a friend of ours – let’s call her Shiku – who knows about the street food scene here because, when she was between jobs, she was part of it.

“Nairobi has a very different street food culture from Kampala,” she said.

“There isn’t the social ambience you talk of. It’s about providing cheap food for city workers who don’t have much money. It’s a matter of providing something people can eat as they go about their daily hustles. It is being sold in kiosks or from carts, particularly at matatu and bus stations.”

I told Shiku that I was familiar with the maize cobs and sugarcane that I have seen being eaten all over the city.

I am familiar with such snacks as mandazis, samosas and chapattis, but I asked Shiku to give me some other examples. She gave me a number. Three, in particular, I remember: mayai gonga, smokie pasua and viazi karai.

Limited range of food

I now understand that mayai gonga is a hard-boiled egg, shelled, cut in half and filled with “kachumbari” or a sauce.

I have learnt that a “smokie pasua” is a ready-to-eat smoked sausage made of pork, beef, chicken or a blend of all these, split in half and filled with “kachumbari”. It is the cheapest sausage sold by Farmers Choice and it is usually sold from carts provided by them.

And I now know that “viazi karai” is made of boiled potatoes, coated in a batter and deep-fried, usually served with a chutney on the side, and available mainly in Mombasa.

At the Nairobi Street Food Festival last Saturday, apart from food and drink, there were stalls selling a variety of things, ranging from ladies’ underwear, jewellery and bags, to electric bikes.

The range of food was quite limited – nyama choma, hot dogs, samosas, pies, cakes and candy floss. I was there at midday when there was still setting up going on and the crowd was quite sparse.

However, people were still arriving two hours later when I was leaving – mainly small groups of young people. There was a DJ playing so, perhaps, the place would become more alive in the evening.

I had a chocolate ice-cream – a universal street food. Is there any country in the world where you can’t buy an ice-cream in the streets?

"Involve church, teachers in war on alcohol","The government’s efforts to curb alcohol consumption are bound to fail if other stakeholders such as religious organisations and teachers are not involved.

The government should also declare the menace a national disaster and make alcohol and drug abuse education a compulsory subject in the school curriculum.

Religious and faith-based leaders command a lot of respect in the communities and millions of people trust them because they stand for moral order, integrity, support groups and social bonding.

For a vice that is deeply entrenched in the country, harsh measures and laws cannot be used as a means to curb it and consumers are likely to become more defiant and resistant.

Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua needs to shift the focus from punishment to prevention and treatment if he wants to curb the spread of alcohol consumption.

Why can’t government officials ask themselves why, despite heavy taxes on alcohol and its by-products, the number of people consuming alcohol increases every financial year?

We must first agree that alcohol and drug abuse are a social, economic, spiritual, mental and general health problem before planning to tackle them.

Religious leaders are central pillars in promoting the fundamentals that provide a solid foundation on which to deal with alcohol and drug abuse in society.

Young people, who are also victims of this system, can be nourished spiritually and mentally through religion and faith-based support groups.

Personally, I was an alcoholic for about twenty years and a cigarette smoker for the same period, but I quit both through involvement in religious activities and gaining positive-thinking friends.

The National Authority for Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada) should take the initiative to make good policies and start and regulate programmes that can involve religious leaders and teachers in this fight against alcohol.

By declaring it a national disaster, the government and stakeholders can seek international funds to manage the programmes to fight the menace.

Inclusion in the school curriculum will ensure that children learn at an early age that vice can destroy health, economy, social bonds and even family and marital status.

Otherwise, the line the government has taken is likely to make the drinkers more defiant and resistant, as the majority are addicted and it’s compounded by rampant unemployment.

I am willing to share my experience with Nacada if invited.

Special centres can also be set up by the government to rehabilitate and teach skills to those who are serious alcoholics.

"After Trump meet, Musk says he won't donate to either US presidential candidate","Billionaire Elon Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla TSLA.O, said on Wednesday that he will not donate money to either Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Democratic President Joe Biden in this year's election, one day after meeting Trump in Florida.

Trump met with Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, with a small group of other people in Florida over the weekend, a source confirmed to Reuters, as the former president seeks a major cash infusion for his campaign.

In a post on his social media platform X, Musk said: ""Just to be super clear, I am not donating money to either candidate for US President.""

In 2022, Musk asked Americans to elect a Republican Congress in U.S. midterm elections in order to counterbalance Biden's Democrats.

He has said on X that Biden is encouraging migrants to come to the United States so they can vote for Democrats, even though people without U.S. citizenship are not eligible to vote in federal elections.

Earlier on Wednesday, Nikki Haley ended her long-shot challenge to Trump, ensuring he will be the Republican Party's candidate in a rematch with Biden in November.

"Biden, Trump woo Haley voters, 2024 election's new prize","Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump are scrambling to win over supporters of Nikki Haley, a constituency that could be crucial to sending either man back to the White House.

Haley dropped out of the Republican presidential nomination contest on Wednesday but did not endorse Trump and said it was now up to him to ""earn"" the support of voters who did not initially back him.

Almost 570,000 voters in three key battleground states - Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan - voted for Haley in the Republican nominating contest, a small but potentially significant group in races that have been decided by tiny margins in recent elections.

Haley won 250,000 votes in North Carolina's primary, for example, a state that Trump won by less than 75,000 votes in 2020.

Both Biden and Trump quickly put out statements on Wednesday calling on Haley voters to join their team - although they used vastly different tactics.

Biden commended Haley on ""speaking the truth"" about Trump, while Trump said he had ""trounced"" her in the Super Tuesday Republican contest.

""Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,"" Biden said in a statement.

In his Truth Social post, Trump added that he ""would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation,"" and described Biden as an enemy who is destroying the country.

Trump has derided Haley throughout the campaign - including using sexist and racist language. And many of her voters have wondered if they still have a place in the Republican Party, which has coalesced around Trump, despite his repeated lies about having won the 2020 election against Biden, and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Still, some experts say there's little precedent for Republicans like Haley's supporters to automatically come out for a Democrat in a general election.

""The next several months are going to be about the two candidates trying to convince people to come home to their regular party,"" said Hans Noel, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University.

""Right now, the numbers are really high for Haley voters to say 'I would never vote for Trump.' But almost certainly most of them will come around and either vote for Trump or they might not vote at all,"" he said, citing historical precedent.

Political strategists believe a significant number of Haley voters were Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents who crossed over to vote in Republican primary contests, to try to deliver a blow to Trump.

Still, a bevy of anti-Trump groups will be working hard to convince Haley voters to get behind Biden.

Reed Galen, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a prominent anti-Trump group of current and former Republicans, said Haley had shown that there are up to 30% of Republican voters who do not like Trump, a figure that would represent about 11 million registered Republicans nationwide.

Galen said his group will target them between now and November's general election, aiming $50 million at an anti-Trump, pro-Biden persuasion campaign focused on battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.

The digital and TV ad campaign will focus on abortion rights, the blow to U.S. prestige abroad under Trump, and his failure to fully support Ukraine in its war against Russia.

PrimaryPivot, another pro-Haley group, changed its name to Haley Voters for Biden just after Haley dropped out of the race.

Co-founder Robert Schwartz said the group will target the roughly 500,000 voters who backed Haley in the primary campaign in Michigan and North Carolina, as well as possible Haley voters in Georgia, which holds its primary March 12.

Republican strategist Ford O'Connell, who worked with Trump during the 2020 campaign, said he expected Trump to extend an ""olive branch"" to Haley supporters but that many were not persuadable.

O'Connell noted that Trump did not go after Haley in his speech on Tuesday night. Trump showed that he ""understood that the way to victory is to stay on the issues: the border, prices, foreign policy,"" O'Connell said.

"Nikki Haley to end White House bid, clearing path for a Trump-Biden rematch","Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.

Haley will give a speech at 10am local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time.

She will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added.

Haley's decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests.

Haley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the party's base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments.

The rematch between Trump, 77, and Biden, 81 - the first repeat U.S. presidential contest since 1956 - is one that few Americans want. Opinion polls show both Biden and Trump have low approval ratings among voters.

The election promises to be deeply divisive in a country already riven by political polarisation. Biden has cast Trump as an existential danger to democratic principles, while Trump has sought to re-litigate his false claims that he won in 2020.

Haley, 52, had drawn support from deep-pocketed donors intent on stopping Trump from winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, particularly after she notched a series of strong performances at debates that Trump opted to skip.

She ultimately failed to pry loose enough conservative voters in the face of Trump's dominance.

But her stronger showing among moderate Republicans and independents - she won unaffiliated voters by a wide margin in New Hampshire and notched almost 40 per cent of the vote in South Carolina - highlighted how Trump's scorched-earth style of politics could make him vulnerable in the Nov. 5 election.

On March 3, she won the Washington, D.C., Republican primary with 62.9% of the vote, versus 33.2 per cent for Trump. On Tuesday, her only win came in Vermont, a small, deeply Democratic state.

Biden has his own baggage, including widespread concern about his age. Three-quarters of respondents in a February Reuters/Ipsos poll said he was too old to work in government, after already serving as the oldest U.S. president in history.

About half of respondents said the same about Trump.

Key issues

As in 2020, the race is likely to come down to a handful of swing states, thanks to the winner-take-all, state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the presidential election. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all expected to be closely contested in November.

The central issues of the campaign have already come into focus. Despite low unemployment, a red-hot stock market and easing inflation, voters have voiced dissatisfaction with Biden's economic performance.

Biden's other major weakness is the state of the U.S.-Mexico border, where a surge of migrants overwhelmed the system after Biden eased some Trump-era policies. Trump's hawkish stance on immigration - including a promise to initiate the largest deportation effort in history - is at the core of his campaign, just as it was in 2016.

Voters expect Trump would do a better job on both the economy and immigration, according to opinion polls.

Republican lawmakers, egged on by Trump, rejected a bipartisan immigration enforcement bill in February, giving Biden an opportunity to argue that Republicans are more interested in preserving the southern border as a problem rather than finding a solution.

Democrats are also optimistic that voter sentiment on the economy will shift in Biden's favour if economic trends go on rising throughout 2024.

Trump may be dogged by his myriad criminal charges throughout the year, though the schedule of his trials remains unclear. The federal case charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 election, perhaps the weightiest he faces, has been paused while Trump pursues a long-shot argument that he is immune from prosecution.

While most Republicans view his indictments as politically motivated, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, about a quarter of Republicans and half of independents say they won't support him if he is convicted of a crime before the election.

Biden has argued that Trump poses a threat to democracy, citing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to reverse Biden's 2020 victory.

Abortion, too, will play a crucial role after the nine-member U.S. Supreme Court, buoyed by three Trump appointees, eliminated a nationwide right to terminate pregnancies in 2022. The subject has become a political liability for Republicans, helping Democrats over-perform expectations in the 2022 midterm elections.

Abortion rights advocates have launched efforts to put the issue before voters in several states, including the battleground of Arizona.

Haley thwarted

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, had been among the first Republican contenders to enter the race in February 2023, but she was largely an afterthought until garnering attention for her standout debate performances later in the year.

She put her foreign policy expertise at the centre of her campaign, adopting hawkish stances toward China and Russia and forcefully advocating for continued aid to Ukraine, a stance that put her at odds with the more isolationist Trump.

But she was reluctant to completely disavow her former boss - she served as Trump's U.N. ambassador - despite his four indictments and two impeachments. Trump showed no such reticence, frequently insulting her intelligence and Indian heritage.

Only in the last months of her campaign did Haley begin to forcefully hit back at Trump, questioning his mental acuity, calling him a liar and saying he was too afraid to debate her.

In the final weeks of the campaign, she became the standard-bearer for the anti-Trump wing of the party, a dramatic evolution for someone who just months earlier praised the former president in her stump speeches.

Still, she said she would pardon Trump if he were convicted in any of the criminal cases he faces, a position she has never abandoned.

UNEA-6 resolutions: The key points and implications,"After a week of negotiations at the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), delegates left with resolutions and decisions to guide countries on critical environmental issues. This year, there were 19 resolutions under consideration, but only 15 made it to the final document passed during the Assembly. Two decisions and a ministerial declaration were also passed. Here is a breakdown of each resolution and its implications for countries worldwide.

Environmental aspects of minerals and metals

Negotiations for this resolution started in 2019 at UNEA-4, where the main discussion was mineral resource governance. Progress was shared at UNEA-5, and this year, countries agreed on the new aspects of the resolution.

The final draft decision now encourages countries to develop regulations to promote sustainable consumption and production of metals and minerals. They must ensure a complete cycle for mineral management as guided in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agenda aims to reduce any arising negative impacts of minerals and metals on the environment, society and economy.

Circularity of a resilient, low-carbon sugar cane agro-industry

This resolution was tabled in 2019 but concluded this year. With the knowledge that sugarcane is farmed in some 80 countries worldwide, including Kenya, negotiators acknowledged that climate change will grossly affect the industry. During the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (COP28) in Dubai last year, countries launched the International Alliance for the Circularity of a Resilient and Low-carbon Sugar Cane agro-industry. This helped propel this resolution to fruition this year.

Amendments to the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured Global Environment Facility

This resolution will ensure that the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) headquartered in Nairobi, will have a stronger mandate in implementing environmental policies under the Global Environment Facility. The facility will ensure inclusivity, transparency, accountability and responsiveness for the projects and programmes under it by ensuring eligibility for] financing global projects is followed to the letter.

Enhancing the role and viability of regional forums of environment ministers and Unep regional offices in achieving multilateral cooperation in tackling environmental challenges

Its objective is to encourage discussion and collaboration among nations to address environmental challenges within their territories. The outcome of this effort will be reviewed during the next UNEA in 2026, where a stocktake will be conducted to assess how countries have incorporated regional forums and environmental authorities in their efforts.

Promoting synergies, cooperation or collaboration for national implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and other relevant environmental instruments

A recently released report, Global Resources Outlook 2024 during the UNEA-6 event showed that humans are using up available resources at an unsustainable rate. It highlights the need for equitable resource-sharing among individuals and nations. To achieve this, countries must improve their knowledge and understanding of the potential benefits of collaboration. This can be accomplished by intensifying efforts to gather and share best practices and promoting information exchange.

Foster national action to address global environmental challenges through increased cooperation between the UNEA, the Unep and multilateral environmental agreements.

After a resolution has been passed by the UNEA, the responsibility of implementing the decisions usually falls on individual countries. While some countries may act promptly, others may take longer to implement the decisions. This resolution encourages all countries to act swiftly and efficiently when complying with multilateral environmental agreements.

Combating sand and dust storms

During the closing plenary, UNEA-6 Leila Benali stated that sand and dust storms were deadly phenomena that often go unnoticed. Therefore, it is crucial to bring awareness to this issue. Sand and dust storms have been increasing globally, with approximately two billion tons of sand and dust entering the atmosphere each year, according to a report by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The resolution highlights Africa and Asia as the most affected regions, particularly in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-regions. The resolution proposes coordinated action to address this challenge and potentially reduce its impact.

Promoting sustainable lifestyles

This resolution demands that countries implement it at the community level, which requires a change in current standards of living. It must be included in the existing program known as the One Planet Network Programme on Sustainable Lifestyles and Education. Unep will need to provide resources to countries, especially for the educational skills necessary to make this shift.

Sound management of chemicals and waste

Many countries have been raising concerns about the issue of pollution, which has been causing negative impacts on people's health. Despite being an existing problem, it has been largely ignored. To address this, a resolution was passed by the World Health Assembly last year, which calls for a discussion during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to promote a Global Framework on Chemicals. This resolution aims to manage and tackle pollution more effectively.

Promote regional cooperation on air pollution to improve air quality globally

There are regulations to address air pollution, but there is still a need to enhance air quality further. The latest resolution acknowledges that air pollution not only affects individuals but also leads to the loss of biodiversity. The Assembly recognises that addressing air pollution would result in numerous benefits. Additionally, taking care of air quality could positively impact climate change.

Manage highly hazardous pesticides

This resolution supports the one passed by the previous UN General Assembly and the one from last year’s World Health Assembly. It highlights the dangers of leaving highly hazardous pesticides unmanaged, which can put people at risk of harm. Therefore, countries are urged to take intentional steps to reduce associated risks. They are also encouraged to conduct studies that can help minimise damage from such pesticides or find alternative and less harmful sources.

Environmental assistance and recovery in areas affected by armed conflict

Despite the triple planetary crisis that the world is facing, other crises, such as war, continue to disrupt everyday life. In areas affected by armed conflict, people tend to focus solely on the war and overlook other underlying issues, such as the environment. This resolution aims to address this by promoting a comprehensive and sustainable approach to managing the challenges faced by conflict-affected regions.

Strengthening ocean efforts to tackle climate change, marine biodiversity loss and pollution

There is a growing concern about the health of oceans around the world. Studies conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have revealed that climate change significantly impacts the ocean and that the situation may worsen as temperatures continue to rise. To address this issue, several agreements and strategies have been put forward, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships.

Effective and inclusive solutions for strengthening water policies to achieve sustainable development in the context of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.

Water is a resource that has often caused conflicts between different countries and communities, as it transcends boundaries, and no single entity can claim ownership of it. Despite this, the world must continue to work towards achieving sustainable development goals related to water. During a recent meeting, delegates expressed concern about the dwindling quantity and quality of water resources worldwide. They encouraged countries to dialogue about collaborating on water-related issues, including local and indigenous knowledge. The progress made on this critical issue will be discussed at the next Assembly.

Strengthening international efforts to combat desertification and land degradation, restore degraded land, promote land conservation and sustainable land management, contribute to land degradation neutrality and enhance drought resilience

Climate change has led to an increase in desertification. However, land degradation is mainly caused by changes in land use. Notably, a large portion of the earth's land is arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid. Restoring these lands can help create a more sustainable economy for those who rely on them. This approach integrates various factors and promotes a holistic approach to land management.

Prioritise content that develops the youth,"Publishing houses should put more effort into producing content that prioritises the personal development of the youth.

They have a unique opportunity and responsibility to contribute to that novel deed by disseminating content that is not only informative but also empowering.

From those who offer practical advice on career planning and financial literacy to those who delve into mental health awareness and self-care practices, there is a vast landscape of topics that can positively impact the lives of young readers.

The significance of publishing such content cannot be gainsaid. It serves to offer a beacon of hope for those struggling with self-doubt or uncertainty about their future.

While providing insights and perspectives from experts and peers, it reassures them they are not alone in their journey to personal growth and fulfilment.

Furthermore, publishing content geared towards the personal development of the youth fosters a sense of community and belonging. It creates a platform for dialogue and exchange of ideas, allowing young individuals to connect with others who share their aspirations and challenges.

Investing in the personal development of the youth yields long-term benefits for society. Empowered and resilient young individuals are better equipped to overcome obstacles, pursue their passion and contribute meaningfully to their communities.

By so nurturing their talents and ambitions, the editors, and publishers, lay the foundation for a brighter and more prosperous future for generations to come.

I encourage the editors and publishers to seize the opportunity of being in their hallowed positions to inspire, educate and uplift the next generation, empowering them to realise their full potential and make a positive impact on the world.

Together, we can cultivate a culture of growth, resilience and hope that will shape the leaders and change-makers of tomorrow.

A visit to the new-look Nairobi Giraffe Centre,"A friend asked if we had been to Nairobi’s Giraffe Centre since its renovation. ‘If not, you will be surprised,’ he said. We hadn’t been there for years; so we went – and we were surprised.

We had been there many times when our two boys were young, and a close-up of Jan gingerly placing a food pellet on the tongue of one of the giraffes, has made it into our family album.

When young, Jan used to be fond of jokes. One of them I remember was:

‘Dad, why is a giraffe’s neck so long?’

‘So he can browse leaves from the top of trees?’

‘No. It’s because his feet smell so bad.’

It was last Sunday that Lut and I followed our friend’s advice. We went well before coffee time, because we were anticipating the Centre would be busy. It already was.

The first surprise was the high-tech entrance – the cashless payment generated a code on our phone, which we could then show to the gatekeeper. And the access to the viewing platform is now via a smart elevated and wheelchair-friendly walkway.

The second surprise was that the charges were displayed as Sh1,500 for non-residents and Sh400 for residents. ‘What about citizens?’ we asked.

‘The same as residents,’ came the answer. We wondered if this meant that the Centre was not really targeting Kenyans – especially when we could see only one little girl with her dad among the visitors on the viewing and feeding platform.

However, when we were later having a chat with David Mutua, who we had just heard making a presentation in the Education Centre, he told us that we had a wrong impression.

‘Stay here till noon,’ he said. ‘You will see plenty of Kenyan families. It’s Sunday, remember. Many Kenyans will be at church, and the others don’t get up early on a Sunday.’

It was an interesting conversation with David. He talked about how he had killed many birds with a catapult when he was a child – like many other children in Machakos where he grew up.

But, later, he became very interested in wildlife and conservation. He said that these days, when he goes back to Machakos, he tries to convince boys to put away their catapults.

Now, David is in a happy place, because he is working for an organisation, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, that is committed to raising the awareness of Kenyan children about the importance of wildlife conservation.

Apart from the opportunity to get close to giraffes (though not close enough to test Jan’s theory about their smelly feet) there is an excellent Education Centre that, with its films, talks, puzzles and competitions, is providing a lot of fun, as well as giving out a lot of information – particularly about the endangered sub-species Rothschild giraffes that are the key actors at the Centre.

A lot of emphasis is given to catering for school visits as well as outreach educational activities.

Over its 40 years, the Centre has engaged with over 2 million children.

Apart from stretching their necks to be fed with small pellets at the viewing platform, the giraffes have many acres of a green sanctuary where they can stretch their long legs.

Also, scuttling across the barer ground close to the Centre, you are bound to see a family of tusked warthogs, with their skinny tails held high when they run.

After a cappuccino at the Centre’s café, we crossed the road and took to the nature trail, for which there is no extra charge. The full walk is 1.5 kilometres, along narrow paths through the indigenous forest.

The recorded number of bird species is 178, and the record sighting in one visit is 60. We saw very few but heard many. You might also see a few of the smaller mammals, such as dik dik, squirrels and, of course, warthogs.

Happiness is something you intentionally create,"Happiness isn’t some impossible dream. It’s something you can work on.

Because most people confuse happiness with success. We’re forever being told that money and possessions will make us happy.

But that’s not true, because material wants are never satisfied. Instead, you should focus on the things that truly make people happy. Such as living in tune with your values. And simple pleasures like quietly watching a beautiful sunset.

So choose a value that’s important to you. Kindness for example, or supporting your spouse, and ask yourself each week how you’ve improved it.

You’ll also feel happier if you minimise choices, simplify your life and create routines. So rather than agonising over what to cook, one meal at a time, plan your meals for the week and then shop for the ingredients.

And create a morning routine that starts your day efficiently. Create a film shortlist rather than forever scrolling through all the streaming menus. Build a go-to playlist for your favourite music.

You’ll be happier if you feel good about yourself. So write a list of things you like about yourself, for example, that you’re honest, or kind, or always there for your friends. If that’s hard, think of someone you look up to, and imagine what they would write about you.

Read: The values you hold say who you really are

Try to find a few tasks that fully absorb you. Even a short time each week doing something that involves complete concentration will increase your sense of control and self worth. Such as practising a tricky pool shot, speed-solving a Rubik’s Cube, following a complex new recipe, or planting out delicate seedlings.

Avoid seeing yourself as a victim. We all do it, such as when someone cuts in front of us in traffic. Instead, change the story to include the other person’s perspective. For example by imagining that the other driver was distracted, and it’s only your skill that prevented an accident.

Or the way people stockpile excessively when there are shortages. It’s easy to see them as villains and ourselves as their victims. Instead, imagine they’re looking after elderly parents and really need that stuff.

And what about those ‘wants’ that we’re sure will make us happy? That glass of whisky, an even bigger television, or a promotion at work?

Strangely, after you’ve got them, you only feel happier for a moment. Only to slip back to where you were before, and probably even less content in future.

Read: Comparing romantic with parental love

Instead, focus on strengthening the aspects of your life that do lead to long term happiness. Such as choosing to feel at peace with the life you have. Stop second-guessing past decisions.

Plan your finances so that you feel confident about coping with unexpected events. Start truly living the life of the person you want to be.

Consciously, spend at least a few minutes every day thinking about each of these. Do that even a little, and you’ll be happier. Do it a lot, and your life will be transformed.

Who are the candidates running in 2024 US presidential election?,"Republican former President Donald Trump and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley are competing to be their party's presidential nominee for the 2024 general election, while President Joe Biden is effectively the Democratic Party's nominee. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.

Here is a list of the candidates.

DONALD TRUMP

Trump has leveraged his civil cases and indictments in four criminal cases - unprecedented for a former American president - to boost his popularity among Republicans and raise funds, helping to make him the Republican frontrunner with 64%, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. He scored victories in the early nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and is pushing to replace Republican National Committee leadership with his own top allies ahead of the party's July nominating convention.

Trump, 77, has called the indictments a political witch hunt to thwart his pursuit of a second four-year term, an assertion that the Justice Department has denied. Several legal challenges have reached the US Supreme Court regarding his eligibility for the ballot following the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol and whether he can claim presidential immunity. If elected again, Trump has vowed revenge against his perceived enemies and has adopted increasingly authoritarian language, including saying he would not be a dictator except ""on day one.""

He has promised other sweeping changes, including gutting the federal civil service to install loyalists and imposing tougher immigration policies such as mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship. He has also promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance, vowed harsher curbs on trade with China and suggested he would not defend NATO allies.

NIKKI HALEY

A former South Carolina governor and Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Haley, 52, has emphasized her relative youth compared to Biden, 81, and Trump, as well as her background as the daughter of Indian immigrants.

She had gained a reputation in the Republican Party as a solid conservative who could address issues of gender and race in a more credible fashion than many of her peers. But Trump has increasingly targeted her, lobbing racist attacks at her ethnicity and amplifying false claims about her eligibility for the White House despite her birth in South Carolina.

Haley, who drew 19% support among Republicans in the Reuters/Ipsos survey, has sharpened her attacks on Trump following New Hampshire's Jan. 23 contest and raised $1 million after Trump threatened her donors. She has also pitched herself as a stalwart defender of American interests abroad, citing Trump's praise of dictators, and ramped up her argument that Trump is too chaotic and divisive to be effective.

She has suggested she will stay in the race past the Feb. 24 primary in her home state, where opinion polls show she trails Trump, and her campaign has blasted Trump's proposed RNC changes, saying the political party should be overhauled and its finances audited.

Biden, 81, already the oldest U.S. president ever, will have to convince voters he has the stamina for another four years in office, amid poor approval ratings and a special counsel report suggesting he suffered memory lapses. Biden has blasted the report, and his allies say he believes he is the only Democratic candidate who can defeat Trump and protect democracy. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll put Biden at 34%, while Trump garnered 37% — close to the 2.9 percentage-point margin of error.

In announcing his candidacy, Biden declared he needed to defend American liberties and pointed to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters. Vice President Kamala Harris is again his running mate.

The economy will also factor in his reelection campaign. While the US escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation hit 40-year highs in 2022 and the cost of essentials is weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost US  industrial output, but he has received little recognition from voters for the latter.

Biden has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to sanction Russia and support Kyiv, and he has been supportive of Israel in its conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian aid. However, he has faced sharp criticism from some fellow Democrats for not backing a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, where Gaza health officials say more than 28,400 people have been killed, thousands of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and residents have insufficient food, water and medical supplies.

Biden's handling of immigration policy has also been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border hit record highs during his administration.

In the Democratic Party's presidential nominating contests, Biden has easily won in New Hampshire,South Carolina and Nevada.

Dean Phillips, a little-known US congressman from Minnesota, announced in October he would mount a long-shot challenge to Biden because he does not believe the president can win another term.

The 55-year-old millionaire businessman and gelato company co-founder announced his bid in a one-minute video posted online, saying: ""We've got some challenges. ... We're going to repair this economy, and we are going to repair America.""

Phillips failed to win any delegates in South Carolina and took second place in New Hampshire. He did not appear on the Nevada ballot.

INDEPENDENTS

ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR

An anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination, but he is far behind in polling.

Some recent Reuters/Ipsos polls showed Kennedy could harm Biden more than Trump in the presidential election, where third-party candidates have affected the outcome of US elections even without winning. Trump's six-percentage point lead over Biden in Reuters/Ipsos polling held even when respondents had the option of voting for third-party candidates, including Kennedy, whose support stood at 8%.

Kennedy is the son of USSenator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid. A surprise Super Bowl ad heavily featuring his connection to his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, angered his family members and prompted him to apologize.

He was banned from Instagram for spreading misinformation about vaccines and the Covid-19 pandemic but was later reinstated. He also lost a legal bid to force YouTube owner Google to reinstate videos of him questioning the safety of Covid vaccines.

CORNEL WEST

The political activist, philosopher Cornel West.

The political activist, philosopher and academic said in June he would launch a third-party bid for president that is likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.

West, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate, but in October he said people ""want good policies over partisan politics"" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.

JILL STEIN

Jill Stein, a physician, re-upped her 2016 Green Party bid on November 9, accusing Democrats of betraying their promises ""for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don’t even make such promises in the first place.""

Stein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.

"Good sex is secret to Joe Biden's long marriage, new book says","Washington,

President Joe Biden has joked to aides that the key to a long and lasting marriage is ""good sex,"" according to a new book about first lady Jill Biden that casts a spotlight on their 47-year romance.

""American Woman - The Transformation of the Modern First Lady, from Hillary Clinton to Jill Biden,"" was authored by New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers and comes out this week.

The part about sex takes up only a few paragraphs in the 276-page book but has already generated headlines.

Rogers writes that Biden opted against running for president in 2004, a decision punctuated to aides when Jill Biden entered the room wearing a halter top with the word ""NO"" scrawled on her stomach.

Joe Biden, now 81, told a group of supporters that year that he had little interest in running for president. ""I'd rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep,"" he said.

The comment drew a shrug from a spokesperson at the time who said then-Senator Biden was ""frankly totally in love with his wife,"" Rogers writes.

""Joe may have tamped down on his public bedroom declarations (in) winning the presidency, but he has joked to aides that 'good sex' is the key to a lasting and happy marriage, much to his wife's chagrin,"" according to Rogers.

The book describes the anguish Joe Biden experienced when his first wife, Neilia, died in a 1972 car crash along with their daughter Naomi.

He and Jill married in 1977, but it took five proposals from Biden to get Jill to agree.

""I've been as patient as I know how to be, but this has got my Irish up. Either you decide to marry me or that's it - I'm out. I'm not asking again,"" Biden said on the fifth try, Rogers writes.

This is what adulting is all about…,"Children imagine that being an adult will be wonderful. As teens, they smugly think they know everything, and that their parents got it all wrong.

Adults know different of course, but no teenager ever gets it. What else don’t they know about adulting?

They don’t know how important it is to make good choices early on, in their education, career and relationships. And that empathy, resilience and motivation are critical skills.

They don’t realise how much their outgoings and responsibilities will be as an adult. Or that they’ll be constantly worrying about money.

They don’t realise how hard they will have to work. Or how easy it is to make friends when you’re young and how much more difficult it is as you grow older.

They don’t realise that life throws some really tough curveballs, and that they’ll have to deal with them on their own. Because no one really cares, and everyone has their own problems to solve.

They don’t know how important it is to look after their health. And that all the abuse they’re heaping on their bodies now will eventually catch up with them.

They can’t even begin to understand how destructive alcohol, casual sex and drugs can be.

They don’t realise how jealous people can be, so that even your best friend might become your worst enemy.

They don’t know that you’re always judged by your looks, no matter how talented or intelligent you are. That it’s not about what you’ve done, but what you’re doing now that matters. Or how fleeting most of our feelings are, so you need to take yourself much less seriously.

They don’t realise how much they have to learn. Or that everyone is the sum of all the choices they’ve made.

Teens have no idea how important it is to learn to deal well with conflict, disappointments, hardships and sorrows.

Or how destructive divorce is, so it’s critical to choose the right person to marry. That marrying someone just for their beauty or wealth is a really bad idea. And that relationships get better as you learn to appreciate the value of kindness and compassion.

They don’t realise how costly mistakes are, how quickly you have to learn from each one, and how repeating the same mistake again could ruin your life.

They don’t realise how slowly time goes by when you’re young, and how fast it goes as an adult. Until one day you realise that you’ve only a limited time left to live. They don’t realise that the money they’re blowing now could be really important in the future.

They don’t realise how many people are competing to impress people they don’t know with money they don’t have. And that life isn’t actually about who makes the most. It’s about who can find the most joy with the life they have.

Bottom line? Adulting is like losing your mother in the supermarket for the rest of your life.

 ,"If Kennedy Buhere were a book, he would be the heavy-duty hardcover type: enduring and primed for the long race.

And nicely holding together, with a tough spine to boot.

However, he cannot be a book; he is a fan of books.

Mr Buhere is the head of communication at the State Department of Basic Education.

To say he is crazy about books would be to imply that he goes gaga when he lays his hands on a title he is yearning to read — which he does.

He will not wait to treat his eyes to a good book, especially the classics. He drools when he comes across a book by one of the great philosophers. He feels like Alice in Wonderland when he sees a biography of a great statesman or woman.

He also loves to savour the folklore of ancient civilisations. Speeches also tug at his heartstrings, the same as classical poetry.

Novels. Plays. Poetry. Folklore. Mythologies. He has a long list of literature that makes him happy.

Due to that constant quest for good books, he is one of the people who keep used booksellers on the streets of Nairobi in business.

“I have bought most of my books from the street book vendors. Some know my taste. They notify me. I buy any book that meets my aesthetic interest there and then. I buy some on credit if I happen not to have cash,” he says.

A library that he has built at his rural home for books is reminiscent of an institution’s library. Tomes and tomes of books are packed on the shelves, and a book lover will be spoilt for choice.

He has a few rules regarding his books, among them that he has always allowed his children or the children he has housed to have unfettered access to them.

“I have allowed (them) to access them without let or hindrance. A book that is never touched is not useful. So, I let them be as careless with the books as possible,” he says.

He also habitually lends books to parents and guardians for the benefit of children with reading difficulties.

He also gives out books to children who love reading but have no books to read; the same as journalism students under his supervision while on industrial attachment.

The book-buying bug bit him in the early 1980s when he was a Form Two student at Kivaywa Secondary School. He has not stopped since.

“I used my pocket money to buy a storybook each term when we opened school,” Buhere recalls

“A few of us decided to go back to school (after the holidays) with a novel, which we used as bait to read books from friends and acquaintances. This is how I began the craze of buying books.

""I remember buying Across the Bridge, Love Root and A Girl Cannot Go on Laughing All the Time. I bought Mwangi Gicheru’s Across the Bridge in January 1980. It has just been published in November of the previous year,” he adds.

He says he has no particular book-buying routine, just buying as and when a good book is available.

So, how many books does he have after buying titles for nearly five decades?

“Just like I cannot remember or count the number of books I have read, I don’t know how many books I have bought or which are in my home library. It’s like asking a person from a pastoral community how many cows he has. My books are the equivalent of cows. I don’t know how many I have,” he says.

The books he reads have influenced his life in different ways, and when we ask him about the titles that have had the most impact on his life, the first one he mentions is Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not, Child.

“It, for the first time, helped me understand that education can be a tool to change things,” he says.

He also reveals that he has kept three novels with him for more than 40 years. They are So Many Hungers by Bhabani Bhattacharya, The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck and The Plague by Albert Camus.

“The books are about a people who suffer painful deprivations,” he says.

“The other book that has had a lasting impact on me is The Federalist Papers, written in 1787. The book, written by three founding fathers of the US – James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton – explains the basis of a modern government, relations within the coordinate organs of government, its relations with the people and how it should govern the public affairs of the country,” he adds.

A chat with Mr Buhere about books quickly opens the pages of other chapters like Kenyans’ reading culture and what can be done to make readers out of Kenya’s young generation.

Meeting him, you encounter an extension of his Facebook persona, where he every so often posts about the need to have readers in society. He is a proponent of reading for leisure.

“Reading implies leisure. Study is for utility, with a defined end in view,” he quips.

His passion for reading, he says, started when he knew how to recognise a whole word.

“That was in Class One, eons ago,” he says, recalling how mesmerised he was to be able to read words like “mama”, “Omo”, “Kimbo”, among others.

He started his primary education at Lukume Primary School in 1972 in present-day Kakamega County.

This is where, thanks to the school library, he learnt to read and had access to books like Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves and the myths of Daedalus and Icarus, King Midas, among others.

After sitting his Certificate of Primary Education exams in 1978, he joined Kivaywa, where he picked up the book-buying habit as a Form Two student.

After completing his O-levels in 1982, he joined Kakamega School, where he got his A-level schooling until 1984.

“I joined the University of Nairobi where I studied for a BA (bachelor of arts) degree in government and literature, and graduated in 1989,” says Mr Buhere.

He had a short stint as a board of governors-employed teacher at Kolanya High School before he became an information officer in 1990.

In 1998, he joined the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication to train in journalism. In 2005, he returned to the University of Nairobi for a Master’s in Communication Studies.

“I have since worked in Eldoret, Kerugoya, Butere, and Busia in the field and, since 2007, at the Kenya News Agency newsroom, Ministry of Immigration and Registration of Persons, Ministry of State for Public Service and now at the Ministry of Education,” he says of his career journey.

Read: Royal literature and Kenyans’ fascination with Kenyattas

Throughout that journey, he has been buying books, some not even remotely related to what he was studying or handling in his day-to-day engagements.

“I have learnt that education and schooling are not the same. One can have modest schooling but be well-educated through reading appropriate books that properly educated people ought to read.

""Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln did not have what we today call secondary education. Winston Churchill and Tom Mboya did not have a university education, yet they had capabilities we associate with university education. Secret? Reading books that educated people in the past read,” he says.

He says the most he has ever spent on a book is Sh2,000, and adds that one gem he bought so cheaply that he couldn’t believe it is a copy of Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist.

“I bought the book in Kibera in 1997 for Sh40,” he says.

Through reading widely, he says, he found ways of tackling tasks assigned to him.

“Reading has helped me to quickly understand the visions, purposes, impediments and opportunities the different ministries are established to actualise or deal with in the process of serving Kenyans. It has given me the confidence to relate with different people, be they in the highest or lowest ranks of an institution. Reading, above all, makes you a humble person,” says Mr Buhere.

Our conversation on how to make book lovers out of Kenya’s children makes Mr Buhere animated. When we ask him whether Kenyan children and Kenyans in general are reading enough books, his first answer is “yes and no”.

He recalls the 1970s and 1980s when primary schools would have book boxes and book corners to cater for the needs of learners who wanted books to read.

“One would like to ask the (school administrators) where the books went,” he says.

“Also, most parents, particularly middle-class parents, value other things than books outside the textbooks. They are ready to buy textbooks the teachers recommend but either they are loath to buy non-textbooks or don’t know the value of non-textbooks in the education of their children,” he adds.

Mr Buhere also laments that secondary schools are not paying enough attention to the kinds of books they stock in their libraries. He feels like most schools have relegated reading to leisure as they elevate the reading of textbooks.

“I have visited some of these libraries. Most of them now have textbooks,” he says. “In this context, are the children reading enough? No. They are surfeited with textbooks and, regrettably, with textbooks, you study its contents; you don’t read.”

He notes that the 8-4-4 curriculum, now being phased out, encourages reading for leisure, giving provisions for learners to interact with newspapers, magazines, poems, and short stories, among others.

“Kenya’s education system has given reading for leisure a pride of place. In the school calendar, the school hours as contained in Section 84 of the Basic Education Regulations, 2015, provide the widest possible latitude for extensive reading — in school, at home, during half term and school holidays.

""Any programme that takes away time for extensive reading has no place in the education system of Kenya. I have not come across any document on education that bans extensive reading,” argues Mr Buhere.

He believes that the number of children who are given the right material for reading by their parents and their schools is “far between”.

“All children in Grade Four and beyond ought to be given opportunities to read books; books suitable to their grades. If some children cannot read at the grade level they have reached, they should be given books slightly below their respective grades to build their reading skills,” he says.

“We have a duty as adults to ensure all children can read, whatever the impediments. Reading is not a natural human activity, like talking or walking. I may be naïve on this. However, I fervently believe that every child, regardless of his or her cognitive ability, can read when skillfully introduced to reading,” he adds.

Goes on Mr Buhere: “I think the adult population owes a duty to children to expose them to the rich cultural heritage of all civilisations. The finest and the most transformative utterances or emanations from the greatest minds are in books.”

Read: Self-publishing - Who is really making the money?

Then we delve into the topic of Kenyans and their reading culture, a subject that has expressed itself in various ways in the past.

A 2023 study by data firm Stadi Analytics and the Writers Guild Kenya found that at least 85 per cent of residents living in Nairobi read regularly and that more than half did so daily. The reading culture was found to be significantly influenced by several factors including income, gender, and age.

The study found that women preferred to read fictition while men read more non-fiction — mostly books, magazines and newspapers. Another finding was that older people above the age of 45 years were more frequent readers than younger ones.

In 2016, the Kenya Publishers Association described Kenyans’ reading culture as wanting.

Its chairman David Waweru said: “The problem with the Kenyan society is that we read mostly for exams, light academic fires and burn books as we dance after ‘completing education.’”

However, Mr Buhere believes the scenario is not that dismal.

“A book vendor on the streets told me that he sold more books during the Covid-19 period than he had ever sold before. And mark you; he doesn’t sell textbooks. Most book vendors in Nairobi CBD don’t sell textbooks. This is a sign that there is a nascent reading culture among a significant proportion of Kenyans,” he says.

He also shares one of his mottos on reading: “In books are the insights and wisdom of our greater ancestors. Reading is the password into their thought systems.”

“Fictional and nonfictional works are full of the wisest and most insightful ideas about mankind and the natural environment,” he adds.

That line sounds weighty enough to make a hardcover book.

Key dates in the 2024 US presidential race,"Former President Donald Trump is the frontrunner to be the Republican presidential nominee in the 2024 election, while President Joe Biden faces little opposition in the Democratic Party in his campaign for a second term.

Here is a timeline of events related to the November 5, 2024, election between now and Inauguration Day in January 2025.

2024

- February 24: South Carolina Republican primary

- February 27: Democrats and Republicans vote in the Michigan state-run primary, which was brought forward by the Democratic-controlled Midwestern state in a move opposed by Republicans. Republicans will instead choose the majority of their delegates during caucuses in March.

- March 2: Republicans in Michigan pick most of their delegates during party-run caucuses.

- March 5: Known as Super Tuesday, this is the biggest single day of primaries.

Both parties hold them in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.

Democrats in Utah will also vote in their primary while Republicans hold their caucuses in the state. Republicans in Alaska vote in their primary.

Iowa Democrats hold the final day of their mail-in caucuses and U.S. territory American Samoa has its caucuses on this date too.

- March 12: Primaries held in the states of Georgia, Mississippi and Washington. Republicans in Hawaii hold caucuses.

- March 19: Primaries held in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio.

- June 4: Primaries in the remaining states are held.

- July 15-18: Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party formally chooses its candidate.

- August 19-22: Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the party formally chooses its candidate.

- September 16: The date set by the Commission on Presidential Debates for the first presidential debate to take place. It is to be held at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.

- September 25: The date set for the only vice presidential debate, to be held at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.

- October 1: The date set for the second presidential debate, to be held at Virginia State University in Petersburg, Virginia.

- October 9: The date set for the third and final presidential debate, to be held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.

- November 5: Election Day

- Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is close and mail-in ballots are a factor.

2025

- January 6: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected.

Ahead of the count on January 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by rioters and some people chanted, ""hang Mike Pence"" as they tried to stop the count. Both chambers of Congress later resumed their work and certified Biden's win.

Congress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results – a much higher bar than existed before, when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.

- January 20: The inauguration of the election winner and their vice president takes place. At this ceremony, the victor is officially sworn in and takes office.

2023 Afcon top scorer Emilio Nsue suspended over gross misconduct,"The Equatoguinean Football Federation (FEGUIFUT) has indefinitely suspended the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations top scorer and captain Emilio Nsue Lopez and midfielder Iban Salvador for gross indiscipline at the just-ended tournament in Cote d’Ivoire.

In a release on Tuesday, the federation did not detail the acts of indiscipline by the players, but referred to a January 29 “unpleasant incident” by Ibdan in Abidjan, which necessitated the intervention of the Ivorian police.

FEGUIFUT Secretary General Juan Antonio Nguema Mene said the incident ""caused a major delay in the return of the team to Equatorial Guinea and also tainted its reputation”.

The statement did not give further details about the said incident, but reports suggest that the Miedz Legnica attacking midfielder allegedly created trouble when the team was checking out of their hotel by accusing the staff of stealing 500 euros (about Sh81,000) from him.

The disciplinary sanctions imposed on Nsue and Iban are part of a raft of measures taken by the executive board of FEGUIFUT following a meeting at its headquarters in Malabo, the body said on its website.

Equatorial Guinea was one of the major surprises at the 2023 Afcon in Cote d’Ivoire. The Nzalang Nacional staged an exhilarating performance, finishing top of Group ‘A’ that included eventual winners Cote d’Ivoire and runners up Nigeria.

Iban scored the Nzalang Nacional’s lone goal in their 1-1 draw against Nigeria, while Nsue scored a hat-trick in Equatorial Guinea’s second group game against Guinea Bissau and a brace in their 4-0 humiliation of Cote d’Ivoire to take his goal tally to five. They lost 1-0 to Guinea in the Round of 16.

FEGUIFUT had earlier on Monday celebrated Nsue for winning the Golden Boot.

“Five goals in four games, Emilio Nsue, captain of the Equatorial Guinea national team is the official winner of the Golden Boot at the Afcon 2023 in Cote d’Ivoire,"" it said on its X (formrely Twitter) account.

Final loss to Ivorians breaks Nigerian hearts,"In Abuja

In Nigeria, Sunday night  was one of the longest and most silent in the history of the country’s football. Fans wanted an end to the final match after Super Eagles scored the first goal against Cote d’Ivoire but they were not in control.

After the initial shock resulting from the initial goal, people turned to prayers in all the match viewing centres.

Later, hisses took over as Nigerian players faltered. Fans wanted the clock to roll over for final whistle, but their wishes turned into more sorrow.  When the Elephants took a 2-1 lead, Nigerian fans crawled to their beds in disappointment.

But characteristic of a parent, President Bola Tinubu, Vice President Kashim Shettima and other top government functionaries counselled Nigerians to accept the silver bestowed on the Super Eagles.

“Nigerians should be of good cheer; we won a great victory in the hearts of Africa and the world by our grit, rigour, and determination in the field of play,’’ Tinubu told Nigerians after the match that ended 2-1 in favour of the Elephants.

“Let this passing event not despirit us, but it should bring us together to work harder. We are a great nation bound as one by the green-white-green banner of resilience, joy, hope, duty, and untiring love.

“To those cherished Nigerian youths expressing their gifts in communities, drawing lines in the sand as they play football in their humble rectangles of play, you can be our heroes tomorrow; do not relent in your pursuit. My administration is here to make dreams come true,” he said.

Tinubu and government functionaries who were at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa to watch the match, saluted the team, coach, crew and the management of the team.  He praised Super Eagles players for reaching the final, and acknowledged the hurdles they overcame.

Vice President Kashim Shettima, who led a government delegation to the packed stadium, said that Africa was the ultimate winner of the tournament.

He stated that the tournament had served as a powerful platform to showcase Africa’s potential and resilience.

“It has reminded us of the importance of teamwork, dedication, and the unwavering spirit that defines our continent.”

He added that the tournament had showcased the brilliance, passion, and resilience of African football, and the power of football as a unifying factor that transcends race, region, or religion.

“Most importantly,  we must keep in our minds that no matter which way the pendulum swings, Africa is the ultimate winner.  The unity of Africa, our tolerance threshold and cohabitation is even more important than the victory itself.

Ivory Coast beat Nigeria to seal third Afcon title,"Abidjan

Sebastien Haller scored the winning goal nine minutes from the end as hosts Ivory Coast claimed a third Africa Cup of Nations title with a 2-1 victory over Nigeria in the final at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan on Sunday.

It was a triumph born from adversity as the Ivorians had scraped out of their group following two defeats, including a humiliating 4-0 loss to Equatorial Guinea, before finding their form in the knockout rounds with a never-say-die attitude that led them to the title.

William Troost-Ekong’s header gave Nigeria a first-half lead as he rose to meet Samuel Chukwueze’s flick-on from a corner, but Franck Kessie equalised just past the hour-mark after being left unmarked at the back post from a set-piece.

The Ivorians had to come from behind several times in the tournament and did it again when Haller steered Simon Adingra’s cross into the net, much to the delight of his rookie coach Emerse Fae, who had started the tournament as assistant to Frenchman Jean-Louis Gasset, who was sacked after the pool stage.

Borussia Dortmund forward Haller was diagnosed with testicular cancer in July 2022 but beat the disease and has been a crucial player for the Ivorians, though he missed the start of the tournament with an ankle injury, playing his first game in the last-16 win over defending champions Senegal.

His story epitomises the fight in the Ivorian side, who became the first home nation to lift the Cup of Nations since Egypt in 2006.

All four of their previous continental finals had finished 0-0, with them winning on penalties in 1992 and 2015, both times against Ghana, and losing the other two.

The home side controlled much of this year's final as Adingra was denied by a fine save from Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali, before the visitors took the lead with their first effort on target on 38 minutes.

Troost-Ekong headed into the net when Ademola Lookman’s corner was flicked on by Chukwueze and the Nigerian captain won the second ball ahead of Serge Aurier.

The hosts had an excellent chance to equalise early in the second half when the ball fell to Max Gradel in the box but his fierce shot was blocked by Calvin Bassey.

Nwabali had to beat away a superb long-range shot from Adingra but from the resulting corner Ivory Coast equalised when Kessie was left unmarked at the back post and headed into the net.

It was the home side who pushed for the winner and came close when Haller attempted a spectacular overhead kick, but the ball flashed wide of goal.

The tall striker did not have to wait long for his goal though as moments later he steered Adingra’s whipped cross into the net to crown a fantastic story.

Ahmed Musa: Super Eagles' behind-the-scenes master,"In Abidjan

Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro has explained the role of long-serving captain Ahmed Musa ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday.

Nigeria meet Ivory Coast at the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpe in Abidjan as they chase a fourth African title.

Musa’s inclusion in the AFCON squad sparked debate and the former Leicester City star has had limited playing time under Peseiro. However, dismissing Musa's contribution based solely on minutes played would be a grave mistake. Peseiro emphasises that Musa's role transcends the pitch, making him an invaluable asset to the Super Eagles.

With 108 appearances, he is Nigeria's most capped player, a World Cup goalscorer, and a champion with the team in 2013 AFCON.

“Ahmed Musa is special and important to the team,” Peseiro said. “He is my assistant. He advises me and gives me the necessary support. He is committed in his role and he can play.""

The 31-year-old serves as a sounding board for the coach, offering invaluable insights from his years on the international stage. This two-way communication fosters trust and understanding, which are crucial for a team's success.

While Musa's playing time may be limited, his presence in the dressing room and on the bench is a source of inspiration and motivation. He rallies the team, keeping spirits high and ensuring everyone feels valued and part of the collective goal.

“He has yet to play, but he has advised me about many things,” added Peseiro.

“He supports the coach who does not pick him to play. He knows better than me some of the players, Ahmed is special, amazing. He commands the team.”

Ultimately, Peseiro's vision is clear: ""We want to win the AFCON for Musa to lift the trophy."" This statement speaks volumes about the immense respect and appreciation the coach has for Musa. Lifting the trophy wouldn't just be a personal triumph for the veteran, it would be a testament to his dedication and the invisible yet crucial role he plays in shaping the Super Eagles' destiny.

The Sivasspor winger seems to have taken the role well, as he insists it’s time for him to watch others play for him.

“I had the opportunity to play for others to win, so now it’s time for me to watch others play for me to win. Whenever I’m called upon, I’ll be ready,” he told journalists.

Haller embodies Cote d’Ivoire’s remarkable journey,"In Abidjan

No player embodies Cote d’ Ivoire’s remarkable journey to the Africa Cup of Nations final quite like striker Sebastien Haller.

The 29-year-old, overcoming personal struggles and recent club disappointments, emerged as the hero in Wednesday's semi-final victory against DR Congo.

Haller, gracing billboards across Abidjan, symbolises the ""Elephants"" spirit. But his path to the AFCON final hasn't been smooth.

Haller's career was sidelined for six months in mid-2022 due to testicular cancer diagnosed shortly after joining Borussia Dortmund. He underwent two surgeries and four chemotherapy cycles, each requiring five days of hospitalisation.

His first competitive appearance for the club only came on January 22 last year against Augsburg. He shone in the Bundesliga run-in, scoring nine goals. But a missed penalty on the final day allowed Bayern Munich to snatch the title. Since then, his club form has dipped, with limited playing time and no goals since August.

Exactly a year after his return to the pitch, with his sights set on the AFCON, an ankle injury sidelined him. Despite all the frustrations, Haller has the chance to lead Ivory Coast to AFCON glory against Nigeria.

""It's going to be a tough, challenging game,"" Haller told journalists in Abidjan ahead of Sunday’s final against Nigeria. ""We've come far, gone through a lot, and are more tightly knit.""

While watching from the sidelines due to injury, Ivory Coast almost crashed out after a group-stage stumble. The France-born star, whose mother is Ivorian, returned, contributing from the bench and scoring in crucial penalty shootouts. Finally, in the semi-final, his volley sealed victory.

""Obviously, the past few years have been challenging for me and my family, so it’s beautiful to sit here in front of you speaking about an AFCON final,” he said.

From injury to hero

While downplaying his role, Haller acknowledges the team's transformation. ""We had slip-ups, but maybe we're a different team now,"" he said. Born in France and representing them at youth levels, Haller opted for Ivory Coast in 2020.

He admits the pressure associated with a cup final on home soil, but insists it’s nothing he can’t handle.

“Not at all, I love it here. Pressure is part of the game; it helps us push even more.”

Sunday's final represents both personal and national redemption, a chance to rewrite his narrative and lift the trophy on home soil.

"After rollercoaster ride, Cote d’Ivoire look to finish job against gritty Nigeria","In Abidjan

From the despair of a humiliating defeat, facing early group stage elimination, to the elation of a last-minute winner, Cote d’Ivoire’s 2023 Afcon journey has been a rollercoaster ride marked by resilience, comebacks, and unexpected heroes.

On their way to the final, set to be staged at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan tonight from 11pm (Kenyan time) host nation Cote d’Ivoire flirted with elimination throughout the tournament.

As the curtain falls on the delayed 2023 African showpiece that has served drama on a silver platter, two titans stand poised for a final clash.

On one side, three-time champions Nigeria (1980, 1994 and 2013), are hungry for their fourth crown. On the other, two-time winners Cote d’Ivoire (1992 and 2015) are fuelled by home soil advantage and a burning desire to lift the trophy after years of near misses. The Super Eagles have displayed moments of brilliance.

But their journey to the final hasn’t been without hiccups.

A 1-1 draw against Equatorial Guinea in the group stages serves as a reminder that their path hasn’t been paved solely with victories. After their opener against Equatorial Guinea was smooth sailing for Nigeria as they beat Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon (Round of 16), Angola (quarter-finals) and Bafana Bafana in the semi-finals.

Written off after early stumbles

But for Cote d’Ivoire, the narrative reads differently. Written off after early stumbles, they’ve risen from the ashes, fuelled by resilience and a touch of fortune.

Their tournament began on a good note as they beat Guinea-Bissau. However, Cote d’Ivoire’s journey took a nightmarish turn, losing against Nigeria and following up that with a 4-0 pummelling by Equatorial Guinea.

With their fate hanging in the balance, Cote d’Ivoire relied on other results to scrape into the knockout stages.

It took Morocco’s 1-0 win over Zambia to earn them a last 16 place.

“Going into that Last 16 match, facing a Senegal side that had started the tournament so strongly, everyone concluded it was the end of the journey for the hosts. But that dramatic comeback restored their confidence,” Tokelo Mokhesi tells Nation Sport.

“You should have seen the celebrations. It was as though they had already won the Afcon. But it was understandable considering how they had started the tournament.”

At that point, Jean Louis Gasset was shown the exit door and replaced by Emerse Fae, a former Reading star.

The appointment came after a failed attempt by the Ivory Coast Football Federation to bring Hervé Renard, the renowned coach of the France Women’s national team, on loan for the remainder of the tournament.

Against Mali, they played with 10 men and equalised with only five minutes to go. Oumar Diakite, a 20-year-old, rose from the bench and scored his first international goal in the 120th minute to beat Mali in the quarterfinal 2-1. And then they laboured for a 1-0 win over DR Congo in the semi-final.

Despite contrasting fortunes in the early stages of the competition, Fae insists the “playing field is level”.

Playing on a level field

“We’re playing on a level field even though we have had different starts to the tournament. They started with a draw and have had a perfect tournament. They grew into the tournament and have been stronger defensively and sharp up front.

“We didn’t start well. The two teams are on the same level. Like any game, like any final, we will try our best. We’re not going to rush anything, and we’ll focus on starting the game on the front foot,” Fae told journalists during the MD-1 press conference.

His opposite number, Jose Peseiro, said they were going all out to win the Afcon.

“Of course, a big game. The final. Good atmosphere. I think full stadium. Both teams will want to win. We’re happy to reach this final. My boys are doing a fantastic job, amazing. I’m happy altogether until now. But we want to win the final. My team is doing the best, but we want to win Afcon,” he said.

The Super Eagles are chasing their fourth continental title, having last won it in 2013.

The Elephants won it for the second time in 2015 and will be gunning for a third one.

Fae will bank on the experience of Sebastien Haller and Simon Adingra, with Seko Fofana and Franckie Kessie expected to pull the strings in midfield.

Peseiro will hope Stanley Nwabali rises to the occasion yet again after only conceding two goals in the tournament. Victor Osimhen, Moses Simon and Ademola Lookman have the responsibility to get the Super Eagles goals. The hosts have conceded seven goals and will have to tighten at the back if they entertain any hopes of lifting the coveted trophy. They have scored six goals, one less than Nigeria’s seven.

Stanley Nwabali: Nigeria's unlikely hero at Afcon,"In Abidjan

An unlikely hero - goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali - has fueled Nigeria's journey to the Africa Cup of Nations final. The 27-year-old, relatively unknown before the tournament, has emerged as a key figure, his presence anchoring a resolute defence.

Nwabali’s impact extends beyond clean sheets. He commands his backline, confidently claims crosses, and snuffs out through balls with decisive positioning. This comfort with the ball reflects his unique journey – he started as a striker before transitioning to goalkeeping.

His rise to prominence has been swift. Despite limited playing time at various Nigerian clubs, he impressed at South Africa’s Chippa United. His performances caught the eye of national team coach Jose Peseiro, who saw potential in Nwabali as a “surprise package”.

Scouting began a year prior, culminating in Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro personally watching Nwabali play in December. Impressed, he integrated Nwabali into the squad, a decision vindicated by the goalkeeper's stellar performance.

He navigated a tense penalty shootout against South Africa in the semi-final, solidifying his position as Nigeria's No. 1 for the foreseeable future.

Nwabali's composure under pressure is remarkable. He put up a sterling performance as Super Eagles beat Bafana Bafana 4-2 on penalties following pulsating 120 minutes of action, where the two nations remained deadlocked at 1-1 on Wednesday night at the Stade de la Paix.

The Chippa United goalie cemented his influence as the unlikely hero in a team that has top stars like CAF Footballer of the Year, Victor Osimhen and Kelechi Iheanacho, as he saved two penalties, in turn denying Bafana a place in the coveted final.

“Congratulations, Stanley “Pitbull” Nwabali. I call him the beast. I’m proud of you, my boy,” said Nwabali’s technical director at Chippa United Morgan Mammila, after the game.

Apart from the penalty saves, Nwabali's familiarity with South African players gained through the DStv Premiership might have aided Nigeria in the Afcon final against Bafana Bafana.

'No love lost'

And despite playing a pivotal role in Nigeria's win, Nwabali expressed his continued affection for South Africa, where he plays his club football.

“A night to remember!!! I felt every bit of it!! Brick by brick and, dreams are coming true,” he said. “No love lost at all. I still love South Africa as much as their fans love me. My name is Nwabali Stanley Bobo, and I love this team with all my heart. Safe hands.”

The Nigeria goalkeeper leads the race for the Golden Glove as he has the most clean sheets at the 2023 Afcon (four). He is at par with his SA counterpart, Ronwen Williams.

Before the Africa Cup of Nations, Nwabali wasn't a regular name on the Super Eagles roster. Nwabali, playing in his first Afcon, emerged as the preferred goalkeeper for the Nigerian national team under coach Peseiro, surpassing Ojo Olorunleke of Enyimba and Europe-based Francis Uzoho of Omonia in Cyprus.

This decision surprised many, as Olorunleke and Uzoho are more experienced players with the national team.

Nwabali hasn't disappointed, as he has played six matches at Afcon and conceded just two goals in Nigeria's Group A opening game against Equatorial Guinea and the semis against Bafana.

“I believe in all my goalkeepers – Ojo Olorunleke, Stanley Nwabali, and Francis Uzoho. I asked my friends in SA about Nwabali and went there to check on him. Thanks to Chippa United,” said Peseiro.

“Nwabali has the quality to be in goal, and he came in to fight for the number one shirt with Uzoho and Ojo, and he's done that,” said Peseiro.

The Chippa shot-stopper said he was in disbelief upon learning that Nigeria coach Peseiro would visit him at his club. He described the moment as a “dream come true,” highlighting the unexpected honour and potential turning point in his career.

“He (Peseiro) is one of the biggest coaches. Coaching a national team like Nigeria, it was like a motivation to me when he said he was coming to see me.”

Back in South Africa, where he has kept seven clean sheets in 14 outings, his club has admitted that keeping him after his Afcon performances may be challenging. Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs are reportedly interested in snapping him up at the end of the season.

In the meantime, Nwabali will continue to live his dream of representing his country at the continental showpiece, and he is just one win away from lifting the Afcon.

He will be in between the sticks when Nigeria take on the hosts, Cote d'Ivoire, in the final on Sunday, with the Golden Glove also up for grabs.

His success transcends individual brilliance. Nwabali represents Nigeria's defensive rejuvenation, a much-needed shift after their World Cup qualifying woes. He embodies the team's newfound resilience, a key factor in their run to the final.

While Nigeria boasts attacking riches, Nwabali's contributions at the back cannot be understated. He has been the silent guardian, the unexpected hero whose brilliance has propelled the Super Eagles on their Afcon journey.

DR Congo protest ‘censorship’ during Afcon semi-final,"In Kinshasa

Democratic Republic of Congo is protesting alleged censorship in the footage aired by rights holders during their Africa Cup of Nations semi-final match against Cote d’Ivoire on Wednesday night.

And the government spokesman Patrick Muyaya on Friday night threatened to withdraw the country from participating in Confederation of African Football (Caf) events until clarification is given on why protests against the war in eastern Congo were not televised to viewers during the match.

The DRC are due to play South Africa for the third spot on Saturday night and although the Leopards, as the Congolese national team is known, indicated they will honour the match, Kinshasa said it could boycott other events.

“To react to this outrageous attitude, our national team will no longer be associated, until further notice, with any solidarity activity or initiative carried out by Caf,” Muyaya said.

Kinshasa’s political leaders have been pushing for what they call ‘dismantling of the lying campaigns and other manipulations’ by the country’s enemies on the war in eastern DRC, where government forces, FARDC, are battling M23 rebels which the Congolese government blames for getting sponsorship from Rwanda.

“Every Congolese, wherever they are, has the duty to respond to the call for the defence of the homeland,” Muyaya said.

After the match on Wednesday night, a shop of the main TV distributor for Canal+ pay-per-view cable TV was vandalised. The Congolese accused Canal + of censoring footage of Congolese supporters during the semi-final match against Côte d'Ivoire.

On that day, the Congolese supporters were carrying banners denouncing “the genocide underway"" in the DRC (in reference to the war in Kivu and its many deaths) ""which is being ignored.""

Although the distributor Canal+ explained that it was only a broadcaster that received footage from the organisers, Caf, the Congolese anger did not abate.

Later, the Council of Ministers met with President Félix Tshisekedi and decided that the DRC team will not take part, until further notice, in the solidarity initiatives organised by Caf.

The DRC has also issued a stern warning to the French television channel France 24.On Friday in Kinshasa, demonstrators protested outside the French embassy in DRC.

There have also been strong protests outside the US embassy in Kinshasa.

Caf did not immediately respond to the allegations but as a member of the world football governing body Fifa, it subscribes to the tradition where political messaging is often avoided. Players sending out such messages are often booked.

However, gradually, Fifa has been accepting certain messages such as the campaign against racism or condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

 ,"First, comes love. Second, comes marriage. To most couples, weddings remain the true spectacle of a couple’s love story when they stand before their beloved and God to commit to love each other till the end of time. Through thick and thin.

To make the wedding day the most memorable experience for the couple is a group of people who work tirelessly behind the scenes to make sure that everything goes to plan, the mood is right and the couple is the centre of attention the whole day.

Event planners, videographers, photographers, decorators, DJs and MCs are the people who make love their business and a couple’s happiness their best form of reward.

As we approach Valentine's Day next week, we asked those who have made love their business to give us a snoop into their lives.



‘I like stripping out all the distractions and going straight for the raw emotions and feelings’

Pareet Shah - Wedding Photographer

Pareet Shah is a photographer who specializes in weddings because he enjoys capturing raw and authentic love between newly weds.

Behind the lens of a camera, Pareet Shah gets a glimpse of a couple’s first day as husband and wife. The raw emotions of joy and affection.

The gaze in each other’s eyes like everything else in the world ceases to exist. He admits that he gets nervous before photoshoots.

“I think a bit of nerves is always good. It shows me that I am on edge, enjoying what I do, and pushing myself to the next level. Love is one of the most powerful and complex emotional experiences that can occur in one’s body.

For me to be able to convey that just using some electronic wizardry found in today’s extremely advanced cameras is almost an oxymoron.

Trying to translate such a primal emotion via an electronic binary device is always challenging but I believe if done correctly, it can evoke some very special and powerful feelings and sensations.

For me, that is the challenge, and my constant search of making this an art. Finding art in love is something I thrive off, something I look forward to at every shoot, and something that gets me up every morning,” he says.

About nine years ago, Pareet was asked to shoot a family friend’s wedding. At that time, he did not have much experience capturing such delicate moments since his professional background was in finance and not photography.

Even though he was a bit hesitant to take on that huge responsibility, he ended up shooting that wedding and as they say, the rest is history.

Now, he has lost count of how many couples he has photographed, but the testimonials from couples on his Instagram page show the significance his work has on making the memory of their special day live on.

Liviya and Lionel, one of the couples who recently tied the knot had this to say about Pareet.

“From posed family photos to candids on the dancefloor, we have such memories because of Pareet. He took the time to really get to know us and made sure he understood our vision for the day.”

Pareet says he has to have several conversations with the couple before taking up a shoot.

“This is to ensure that the couple knows that I am the right fit for them and also for me to know that the couple is a right fit for my style of shooting. To relieve heartbreak later on, I would rather be honest with a potential couple before a shoot in case our styles are vastly different,” he says.

He prefers not to pose couples as this serves very little purpose in the goal of documenting authentic love. He would give a couple a prompt and whilst they ‘play’, he clicks away - capturing them in different lighting, and angles. His overall goal is to create art from the love that exists between a couple.

“When you challenge yourself, you will be surprised at how much authentic love you can capture without posing a couple. I like stripping out all the distractions and going straight for the raw emotions and feelings.

As a couple, I want you to be transported to that exact millisecond when we capture that one moment that will never repeat itself.

Love doesn’t always mean hugs and kisses. Love can mean the slightest touch, the briefest eye contact, a subtle brush of the hair or even tears. I try and capture all these subtle moments for you to feel giddy when you see the final photos,” he adds.

Pricing for Pareet’s services starts at Sh150,000, but he says all weddings and shoots are so different in terms of the location and the number of hours that he spends on them.

“I love working with couples who see our time together as an opportunity to create art. Couples who want to experiment with me in the moment generally end up with the most compelling imagery.

I need space for creativity. If you have pre-determined shot lists or prefer to operate using a photo checklist, then I am afraid I may not be the right photographer for you,” he says.

“We are emotional supports, counsellors, mediators, and problem solvers.”

Salima Bertoglio - Wedding Planner - 10 years’ experience



Salima Bertoglio is a wedding planner with over 10 years of experience and is currently the general manager of Swahili Beach Resort in Diani which is a destination wedding hotspot.

A short while after Salima Bertoglio got married, her friends asked her to help them plan their wedding since she planned her own. Soon, friends of friends were asking for her services, and it became a full-time job.

“It was meant to be. I have been a wedding planner for almost a decade and started when wedding planners were not even in vogue yet. Eventually, it led me to get the position of General Manager at Swahili Beach Resort. It is one of the best resorts for bespoke destination weddings which I am still very much involved with planning,” she says.

She explains that a wedding planner could simply be defined as a project and logistics manager to carefully plan all the steps such as budgeting and the suppliers to be sourced and coordinated.

“In reality, it is so much more. We are emotional supports, counsellors, mediators, and problem solvers. We deal with so many personalities, family dynamics and environments.

A wedding is considered by many as ‘The Best Day of Your Life’. The pressure is pretty high but so worth it. I am a pretty simple and direct person. The first thing I tell my couples is, ‘This is your day. Not mine, not your families' or anyone else's - What do you want?’ Always respecting families and traditions, of course.

Couples are so diverse that I do not have a standard method, but I mould the wedding planning journey according to what makes them comfortable,” she says.

But Salima’s joys are simple - to see couples, families and friends smile, shedding tears of joy, dance and simply be together.

As a destination wedding planner in East Africa, she has learned about different cultures from planning countless Indian weddings (from Gujarati to Sikh) to Kenyan weddings (from Kikuyu’s Ruracio to Luo’s Nyombo) and mixed weddings, with possibly the most exotic being a Korean gentleman marrying an Iranian lady.

One of the perks of being a destination wedding planner is travelling to very interesting destinations to plan weddings, from Zanzibar to the shores of a crater lake in the middle of Marsabit National Park.

“In Kenya, to get a good wedding planner, you won't spend less than Sh240,735 ($1,500), but it could go all the way to Sh1.9 million ($12,000),” she says.



“One wrong song can change the couple's mood and interestingly, guests draw energy from them.”

A wedding without music and dancing is like a restaurant without food. That is why sound teams and DJs like Patrick Kahuha are mood setters of weddings. Their song selections are the only way to get people off their seats and keep them on their feet. Similar to Pareet, his first gig as a main DJ was when he was asked to play at a friend’s wedding in 2019.

“I was so nervous but pulled it off. I started DJing at weddings back in 2015, although I used to work under a mentor (DJ Stretch). Since then, I have played at more than 100 weddings and counting,” he says.

Since weddings are very intimate and personalised, Patrick has seen that one wrong song can change the couple's mood and interestingly, guests draw energy from them.

“If the mood is not right, then it will show, but when you play good music and the vibes are good, you will be called for other functions. Good music makes the couple more relaxed and guests comfortable, creating an atmosphere of pure fun times and memories. Most people will remember bad sound and pathetic music more than they will remember bad catering. Music is everything. It sets the mood for a successful wedding day,” he says.

Patrick looks out for reassuring nods on the dancefloor to gauge their satisfaction with the song selection or the occasional cheer when the guests hear a song they like or when the newly wedded couple starts dancing to a specific song. He says most DJs and sound teams charge between Sh70,000 to Sh120,000 depending on the details, such as the venue and number of guests. Sometimes, a master of ceremony (MC), DJ and sound team can come as a full package.

“When handling different cultures, you get to learn so much about the couple and how different communities communicate love,” he says.



“MCing has helped me put food on the table consistently.”

For James Kibunjah, becoming a master of ceremonies at weddings started purely by accident.

“A friend of mine (DJ Smaff Selector) challenged me to hype at a wedding where he was the DJ, and after that one gig, I knew I wanted to be in that space. Now, I have provided my services for more than 300 weddings. As an MC, my main role is to ensure that we adhere to the program and its timings while curating fun activities,” he says.

He says the most exciting part of his job is dancing with both the young and old, and especially teaching the older folks the latest dance moves. At the end of the wedding, he measures his success by how much the guests enjoyed themselves, the memories created and running the wedding program successfully, which would be the couple’s answered prayer - that all goes according to plan.

“MCing has helped me put food on the table consistently. On a deeper level, I have made treasured connections, and in a way, it has opened the door to corporate MCing,” he says.

The MC, a lawyer by profession, adds that he charges a minimum of Sh60,000 for MCing, but pricing depends on different packages or requests that the couple has.

Wins from exciting 2023 Afcon,"In Bouake

The 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) has been a thrilling ride, showcasing the best of African football on and off the pitch. While there's still the final match on Sunday, let's celebrate some of the tournament's successes.

Rise in female referees

The 2023 edition witnessed a notable increase in female referee participation, with six officials taking the field compared to four in the 2021 edition in Cameroon.

The six females are part of the 68 match officials gracing the field at the 2023 Afcon – each carrying a torch for increased female representation in the beautiful game. These trailblazers bring a wealth of experience to the tournament, having honed their skills in domestic leagues and international competitions.

The milestone builds on a growing trend of increased representation for women in leadership roles and officiating internationally.

From boardrooms to dressing rooms, and now to the centre of the action, women are carving their space in the beautiful game, inspiring young girls and aspiring referees worldwide.

In addition, this isn't simply a numerical increase; it's a symbolic stride towards greater gender equality in football officiating on the African continent.

The match officials are Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, a qualified nurse. She broke the glass ceiling by re-writing the history books as Mukansanga became the first female referee to officiate an Afcon men’s game at the 2021 Afcon tournament.

Morocco's Bouchra Karboubi is making her debut at the 2023 Afcon, and she was the centre referee when Nigeria beat Guinea Bissau 1-0 in the group stages. Karboubi added her name to the history books by becoming the second woman to officiate a game at the Afcon after Mukansanga.

Another debutant is South Africa's Akhona Makalima. The hard-working match official is highly rated and respected in southern Africa, where she is known for her no-nonsense approach to her work in SA's top-flight - the DStv Premiership.

""I would say it has been a very good experience. There are a lot of things to learn in a short space of time and a lot of growth, I would say, because previously, in other tournaments, I came as VAR, but to perform at the highest gives me a lot of experience,"" Makalima said.

Joining the female trailblazers at Afcon 2023 is Zambia's Diana Chikotesha. ‘Super Diana’ is taking on her first-ever men's match assignment.

Cameroon's Carine Atezambong steps onto the Afcon stage, ready to make her mark. This will be her debut as a Video Assistant Referees (VAR) at an Afcon tournament.

The presence of the ""fantastic six"" on the pitch, touchline and VAR room sends a powerful message to aspiring young referees worldwide, demonstrating that the highest levels of the sport are attainable regardless of gender.

Alongside the strides of female officials, the tournament has witnessed surprising results from underdog nations.

Upgraded prize money

Before the start of the 2023 Afcon, the Confédération African Football (CAF) announced a 40% increase in prize money for the champion team in Côte d'Ivoire.

The victor of the TotalEnergies Afcon Côte d'Ivoire 2023 will be showered with a staggering USD 7 million. The runner-up won't go home empty-handed, pocketing a cool USD 4 million.

And the excitement doesn't stop there: each semifinalist will pocket USD 2.5 million, while the four quarterfinalists will walk away with USD 1.3 million each.

""CAF has made significant progress over the past two years in increasing the Prize Money of the Afcon and all its other major competitions,"" said the President of CAF, Dr Patrice Motsepe.

""We have increased the Prize Money of the Afcon Winner to USD7 million, which is a 40% increase from the previous Afcon Prize Money. I am confident that a portion of the Prize Money will contribute to developing football and also benefit all the football stakeholders, as well as assist our Member Associations with their administrations.”

The giant-killers at the 2023 Afcon

The tournament has been riddled with unexpected results, with smaller nations like Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and Comoros causing upsets against established powerhouses.

This highlights the rising depth and competitiveness of African football across the board. South Africa, whose only title came 28 years ago, made it to the semi-finals for the first time since 2000.

The upset parade signals a shift in African football. The so-called 'smaller nations' are closing the gap on established powers, leading to a more competitive landscape.

The 2021 champions, Senegal, 2022 Fifa World Cup semi-finalists, Morocco, and record African champion Egypt all exited the tournament in round 16.

On the other hand, Algeria, who are the 2019 champions, Tunisia and Ghana, failed even to make it to the knockout stage as they were eliminated in the group stages.

As witnessed in recent weeks, Equatorial Guinea unexpectedly hammered the host nation Ivory Coast 4-0, with Ghana suffering a shock 2-1 defeat at the hands of Cape Verde.

In the group phase, Tunisia also fell to a shock 1-0 defeat against Namibia. Meanwhile, Mauritania served up a shock result as they dumped Algeria out with a 1-0 victory. Mozambique also held Egypt to a 2-2 draw.

“It just shows how much football is changing. In the last four, you had a team with a dominantly local-based squad – South Africa. 20 of the players were South Africa-based, and they beat teams with players playing for top European clubs. The gap is certainly closing,” says Tokelo Mokhesi, a South African football journalist.

Off-field trumps:

Cote d’Ivoire prepared meticulously for the event, boasting world-class stadiums and training facilities that will continue serving the development of African football even after the tournament concludes.

The tournament has significantly boosted the Ivorian economy through tourism, infrastructure development, and job creation.

“There are a lot of things Caf and the hosts have done right from an organising point of view,” says Velile Mnyandu, chairman of the South African Football Journalists Association (SAFJA). “It talks about how a host country can collaborate with Caf to create the best tournament. They’ve built the training pitches in the schools.

They’ve built some in local communities.”

He gives credit to Caf for the idea of building City CAN Villages, where players stayed throughout the tournament.

“Credit to Caf, whose idea was to build City CAN as they anticipated the shortage of hotels. The City CAN is more relaxed and has a much better setup. Security-wise, it’s not easy to budge like in a hotel.

“We struggled to gain entrance into the village to interview Bafana Bafana players. Security was so tight, which is a good thing.

“The set-up is cool for the athletes with everything they need to relax,” explains Mnyandu.

While the final match promises an exciting culmination to the tournament, these successes extend beyond the pitch.

Afcon 2023 has served as a powerful platform to showcase African football's development, talent, and potential to the world. It has fostered national pride, economic growth, and a renewed belief in the sport's bright future on the continent.

Why men are feeling under pressure to not act their age,"She’s not that kind of girl. That’s what I was thinking when some Daughter of Zion, who had recently abandoned the narrow path to join the damned on the road to hell, was living out the best of her 20s. She had dirtied our table with all manner of drinks, and I for once, was grateful for Beijing 1995.

She had money like a celebrity big-boy government official. Mbeca. Moolah. Kakitu. We had been friends since campus, she the overtly religious one, me the ambivalent Sunday Christian able only to mutter The Grace—or, perhaps more accurately, mutter about Grace, yule dame pointi wa choir.

Read: Mantalk: How are Kenyan women as compared to Tanzanian ones?

“I just feel like I am missing out on the best of my years. I want to have my slay-slash-hoe era now so that I don’t do it when I am too old,” she says.

I know the hand that quenches me, so I don’t object. “Hoe era (are we allowed to say that anymore?), hmm?” I nod, silently, both to her, and the waiter who just passed by, a universal sign language that screams: Yes, chafua meza. Cheers, I’ll drink to that.

While the devil on my shoulder whispered in my ear and wanted to know if I was on her hit list, I could relate. For the majority of my 20s, I never felt my age. It was a pendulum, oscillating between feeling too old to do certain things, and too naïve to be in certain rooms. I spent time trapped in this chasm, a sort of man-baby, not quite man, not entirely boy.

This is something I have observed too in my male friends. Not feeling your age. I was joking with someone’s daughter the other day when a potential client ended our call with: “Keep me posted.” I told her—someone’s daughter, not client—that back in the day keep me posted just meant keep me informed.

Now, everyone is kept posted, literally and metaphorically. I bring this to your attention because living in our real-time age of notifications and updates, we are feeding on a collective fear that we are missing out on something, whether it’s a fabulous party, an “Unbeatable Sales!”—like the whole world knows something and we haven’t been let in on the secret. Life, nowadays, feels like those ‘DM for prices’ people.

Read: Mantalk: As a woman worries about biological clock, the man’s financial clock is ticking

The trade-off is that milestones are constantly set higher. There is a Top 40 under 40, a Forbes 30 under 30, believe you me a 20 under 20 too, and heck, if I get a (climate-facing, whatever that means) funder, I will even start my Top 10 under 10!

The markers we used to achieve at certain ages—like reading, walking, moving out, marriage—now feel less like milestones and more like monuments. There is a gnarling sense of doom, delivered straight to your doorstep, and everyone is subscribed.

It's only when you step back from the centre—the noise, the (ring) lights, the cameras—and embrace the shadows that you start putting into perspective how far you have come. In oversimplified terms, it is understanding that it is okay to readjust your sails according to the wind; to set new milestones, to actually feel your age.

It is (part of) the reason there has been a spike in young boys going after mumamas; ditto young ladies with their Viagra mubabas.

At 15, I hadn’t had a clue why I liked girls with lisps or braces; at 20 I knew I had no business being in a long-term relationship; at 28 I couldn’t find myself willingly in a club with an MC and call that fun.

At 30, you can no longer be dating potential. The truth is, time is running out. But that’s just one truth. The other truth is; that you are in control. And an even more sinister truth is – you cannot live a 20s lifestyle on a 60-something-year-old body. The arthritis will call you out. Si it’s me who is telling you?

Read: Mantalk: Men, quit complaining, it’s time to take personal responsibility

That’s another thing. Younger people think old people are fools, old people know younger people to be so. It’s my ancestors who said that what an old man sees while sitting, a young man won’t see atop Mt Kilimanjaro.

The thing here is simple, learn to live your age. Life by itself is a crapshoot: You roll the dice, and you see what happens. This is our great depression. Children can’t be children if adults are not adults, but children also can’t become adults. They need models, to look up to when young, to define themselves against as they grow older.

You play your part by being your age, I’ll play my part by being my age. For instance, at 30, when people ask, you should be able to say what you are rather than what you hope to be.

At 30, it’s time you also admit that your politics matter, you will never be needed for a national team, and you can’t wear Crocs in public. Among my peers there is a now-or-never mood: the show is still going on, but the curtain call is ringing. Hear! Hear!

What’s cute in your 20s can be weird at 30 and dangerous at 40. Do you have a pen, because I am about to sign you’re a reality cheque: This is the youngest you will ever be! I know they told you 30 is the new 20, but take it from me, it’s not.

You see, I have discovered that people don’t mind being trapped, as long as no one is free. The English said misery loves company. The Swahili got it much better, with their curt methalis: Kifo cha wengi, harusi.

“You know, I’m 26, but I feel 22. Covid years don’t count. Wacha nijibambe before niolewe!” said my rainmaker. Problematic as her statements sounded, I am not one to judge. I still collect toys of cars and action figures—a pilgrimage to a childhood lost—at my big age (sometimes I feel 17, as long as I don’t look in the mirror).

She presented her case with a half-hearted “don’t repeat this” tone, to which I nodded sensitively and murmured, “I would never,” while already scheduling it for today’s column.

As ever, compassion and empathy are the handiest of utensils. Because it didn’t matter to me what age she felt like—reality will soon deal her her cards—the only number I cared about was what position I was on her hit list.

"Pastor Kitoto: My wife is in love with a married man, but I still want her","Dear Kitoto,

My wife of six years broke up with me five months ago. She told me she wanted a break from the relationship. I love her and want her back. She said I am not the problem, but I do not understand why she left. I asked her if she was seeing another man and she denied it. But I discovered that she had been in love with a married guy for about a year. I felt hurt and betrayed but I still want her back. After a lot of reflection, I regret deciding to abort our unborn baby three years into our marriage. Could it be the reason why she fell for this man? I want to make things right and restore our marriage.

Mark Mosota





Dear Mr Mosota

Being married for six years, one would expect a certain level of growth in the way you relate with your wife. I, therefore, question the level of commitment that existed between the two of you.

It is not clear what led to the rift between the two of you and drew her to this married man. However, the six years of marriage lacked certain basic expectations. First, something was bothering this woman. Yes, she confessed that you were not the problem. But was this a way of justifying her withdrawal from you?

I believe if handled differently, the rift could have been healed.

Resolving indifference requires skills in both emotional and relational intelligence.

Read: I love older women, but for acceptance, I need to marry a younger wife

Second, her decision to move out and into another relationship, was wrong knowing that she was married to you. However, people have a right to make their own decisions.

Hurting people are more likely to continue being hurt unless they choose to turn a new leaf. Her walking away was an indication that she wanted nothing to do with you not forgetting the unresolved issues she was dealing with. Can you help her heal? I believe past or ongoing conflict requires love, patience and open disclosure of feelings.

I am cognizant of the fact that you encouraged her to abort. This may or may not have been the key reason for her move to cheat on you. In addition, her love affair with this guy while still married to you was part of her desire to find love and acceptance that she was missing. It is possible that the abortion left her feeling wounded and rejected.

But, we can only speculate because you did not talk about it. You may see her reasons for withdrawal as valid or not. But what is clear is that she has decided to move out and into another relationship.

Third, being your wife, do not force her back unless she is convinced that she made a mistake to break up with you. You are still single and I commend you for that.

Read: My ex-wife wants me back but I have moved on

However, her choice to come back through your efforts or hers should not be treated lightly.

It is going to be an uphill task.

Restoration will depend on a few key factors: Acknowledge all underlying factors that will have to be addressed before any decision is reached.

For example, 1) Why did she move out? 2) what made her move into another relationship while still married to you? 3) is your decision to remain single solely because you still have hope in restoration? 4) are you willing to pay the price of what it will take to make it work?

And finally, is your reaction based on past guilt associated with the abortion, or a clearly thought-through decision?

Read: Am I a fool for sticking with my cheating wife?

If your answer is for a restoration, first, seek an appointment with her.

Restoration is hinged on her willingness to have a sober dialogue. Second, identify her concerns.

Whether they are in the past, wounds connected with past injustices—unless resolved, can linger for a long time.

Finally, resolve the issues without pointing fingers.

Seek professional help where possible.

Jury orders Donald Trump to pay $83 million for sex assault defamation,"New York, United States

A jury in New York ordered former US president and 2024 candidate Donald Trump on Friday to pay $83.3 million to compensate the writer E. Jean Carroll whom he was found to have sexually assaulted and defamed.

The civil order, which prompted an audible gasp in the federal court, far exceeds the more than $10 million in damages for defamation that Carroll had sought.

Trump lashed out almost immediately, calling the verdict ""ridiculous"" in a statement and promising to appeal.

The jury reached its decision after slightly less than three hours of deliberations.

Trump had been in court earlier, storming out at one point but subsequently returning for closing arguments. He was not in court when the level of compensatory and punitive damages were read out by a court clerk.

A juror exchanged a smile with Carroll as the nine men and women left the courtroom after the judge encouraged them to protect their privacy.

""It's clear to me... you paid attention,"" Judge Lewis Kaplan told the jury following the verdict.

The order was comprised of $65 million in punitive damages after the jury found Trump acted maliciously in his many public comments about Carroll, $7.3 million in compensatory damages, and $11 million for a reputational repair program.

""I was not surprised (by the award) partly because his egregious misbehaviour during the trial could actually have alienated the jury,"" said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

""(Trump) is unlikely to prevail on appeal, because the (appeal) judges have great respect for Judge Kaplan, who is a very experienced federal jurist.""

Trump -- whom a jury found liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a separate federal civil case in New York -- used his Truth Social platform to fire off a spate of insulting messages attacking Carroll, the trial, and the judge, whom he called ""an extremely abusive individual.""

""We were stripped of every defense -- every single defense -- before we walked in there,"" said Trump's lawyer Alina Habba outside the court. ""I am proud to stand with president Trump... We will immediately appeal.""

Trump, 77, briefly took the stand on Thursday to deny he instructed anyone to harm Carroll with his statements.

During Trump's testimony, Kaplan limited him to three questions from his lawyers, to which he could only answer yes or no -- a precaution taken to prevent the Republican leader from returning to his custom of disparaging the court or Carroll in public.

""This is not America,"" Trump said as he left the courtroom following his short appearance.

He was not required to attend the trial or to testify. However, he has used the case, as well as others he faces, to generate heated media coverage and to fuel his claims of being victimized as he campaigns for a return to the White House in November's election.

Trump separately faces multiple criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden, and a civil business fraud case.

Habba sought to have the case thrown out Thursday on the grounds that threatening messages targeting Carroll, which have been aired in the case, began on social media before Trump's 2019 comments. Her request was denied.

Jurors were shown Trump's October 2022 deposition during which he confused a picture of Carroll for his former wife Marla Maples, which threatened to cast doubt on his claim Carroll was not his ""type.""

Last year, another federal jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and subsequently defaming her in 2022, when he called her a ""complete con job.""

Trump had been in court while he campaigned ahead of the New Hampshire primary, which he won handily over his only remaining challenger Nikki Haley, as he closes in on becoming the Republican candidate in the November election against Biden.

Mantalk: How are Kenyan women as compared to Tanzanian ones?,"Something embarrassing happened to me recently. I’ll tell you but promise not to laugh. Okay? Okay. So, I am in Kigoma, Tanzania. You know, I am a Rastafarian Anglican so I only pack enough underwear for a week’s trip. Three shirts because who covers an Adonis? I have enough room in my suitcase left for my ego, which is gigantic. Anyway, when I got here, I discovered I only carried a pair of shoes—the ones on my feet.

I could hear someone’s daughter’s voice in my head – “This is why you need to marry me!” but I don’t see how marriage and shoes are connected. Anyway, I ask the nearest Tanzanian in Nyerere-esque Swahili: “Nitapata Bata wapi?”

Read: Mantalk: Dear men, whoever said you have a right over a woman’s body, lied

Of course, everyone knows Bata, the footwear shop, right? Wrong. He points me to a building that does not look like it has Bata. I think, you know jirani is not good with the queen’s language.

I ask the man next to the building, “Bata iko wapi?” He tells me, “Go inside.” I kid you not, when I enter, it’s a club. Apparently, in Tanzania “bata” means sherehe. So, when I asked around for Bata, they thought I was looking for a club. As if that’s all I ever do. I mean it is, but still.

I am not one to question the ancestors so I indeed sat down in that Bata. Si bata ni bata ama? A friend, Brayson, from Arusha, later joined and we got talking. We were having beer at the right place and at the right price. That means the more he irrigated his throat, the more fertile it became.

I listened to him talk. I didn’t want him to stop. He spoke like his tongue grew words, and he was in a hurry to set them free.

Read: Mantalk: As a woman worries about biological clock, the man’s financial clock is ticking

When we reached Nirvana, that zen-like state in which monks climb mountains to go and meditate as if they don’t know that all they need is ABV 5 per cent and above, he finally opened up — Brayson, not the monk. Men of course do not gossip.

We “open up.” We discuss ideas over a moja mbili. We talk sharas, which is what a conman selling soil in Laikipia calls biashara. And he told me stories. Stories of how when he came to Kenya, the girls were so aggressive, that they could smell the haves and the have-nots and the have-littles, that in Tanzania they are used to buying beers in buckets, and when they replicated that in Kenya, everyone thought their table was the VIP one.

Unlike our Tanzanian sisters, he said, Kenyans “wanakupeleka mbio.” His words. Everything is a fight. “Unakanyaga pedal, yeye anaweka gear.” I wanted to know what part he would play in strengthening jumuiya ya Afrika Mashariki and whether he would consider marrying a Kenyan and he insisted on having one more beer before answering that.

Read: Mantalk: Why men should learn to enjoy solitude

No, he said. Kenyans are combative, not submissive. “Wamenizidi maarifa,” and then came the indictment: Kenyan girls are good to have fun with, not good enough to marry.

And I wanted to tell him that women are to be observed not understood, but I knew better. Just like I know that there is truth to his words. Socrates maintained that a man who lies to himself has an enemy living within.

The truth is, a majority of Kenyan women are masculine in nature. While Kigoma is a lover’s island, Nairobi is a gangster’s paradise, the reason why the phrase “Love is a battlefield” was invented. We are all wet dreams of Nairobi’s fantasies. It’s Bethlehem with a dirty mind, Jerusalem with a lascivious smile.

Of course, maybe this all could be that jirani is putting on a show for me. That wametoa “sahani za wageni” and are hoodwinking me. Like Jesse parading all his sons before the prophet Samuel only for Samuel to ask, “Are these all your sons?” Of course, they weren’t all his sons, and the son that Jesse hid ended up becoming the king. Maybe jirani is doing the same.

But for the sake of argument, let’s say they are not. You see, floating there on Lake Tanganyika, it felt as if the spirit of discernment had descended on me like a dove, and the word was clear: Kenyans are naturally predisposed to aggressiveness.

We come from a scarcity mindset and have had to fight our way through—and crucially for—everything. That’s why in business we undercut each other, in families we pit against each other and in love and relationships, it’s a power play.

Love is a brutal, deadly game, but a game, the best there is. And men love games. Relationships are the fields in which these games play out. We grew up listening to wataalam on radio who would tell us that utamu wa ndoa ni kelele za bibi.

We internalised that gobsmack, until the point where you find a submissive woman, is seen as a weakness. Get me clearly, I do not mean submissive in the sense that one is trampled upon or does not have dreams or lives to please the other. Contrary. Submissive in the sense that all relationships exist on a power dynamic, a trade-off between power and influence—while the man holds the power, the woman has more influence.

Read: Mantalk: Not everyone wants a summer bunny’s money but...

On one of those Sundays that my mother promised me chapos in exchange for accompanying her to church, the pastor was talking about “helpers.” The verse resonated with me because we have made the term ‘helper’ look weak when in essence nothing can be further from the truth. A helper should be stronger than the one they are helping. When the man calls a woman a helper, in essence, he understands that indeed, the woman is stronger. But a man can't learn what he thinks he already knows.

Kwa jirani kwema. The grass is always greener on the other side. Maybe. But our people say he who has not travelled thinks his mother is the best cook. When you experience other cultures, you get a different perspective.

Sometimes you appreciate what you have back home. Sometimes, you see the wood for the trees. I shake my head at my younger self now, as we often do. Then again, a man can't learn what he thinks he already knows.

And when the old men in the village tell you they want to find wives for you young men in the city, you say ni mambo ya zamani hiyo. You are dot com. They know that you will eventually find out. But isn’t it impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows?

PS: I never got to Bata. Didn’t our ancestors walk barefoot anyway? Did they die?

This is why we prefer the company of pets to intimate unions,"By nature, humans are social beings. Right from birth, we are wired to seek connection and interaction with fellow humans in intimate relationships. An infant seeks its mother for breastfeeding, a child seeks its parents for comfort when troubled and adults seek each other out for love and companionship. Mutual trust, emotional availability and vulnerability, shared life experiences and a sense of security are common desires among human beings.

Much of our socialisation comes from interacting with other people, which forms the basis of who we are as individuals and how we conduct ourselves while being part of a larger society.

But there is a growing class of individuals who are actively choosing to deprioritise intimate relationships with fellow human beings, and pets are their replacement of choice. Often, their social batteries do not last beyond interacting with colleagues at work and the rare meet-ups with family and friends before they want to run back to their private spaces.

They choose to spend more time with things that soothe and give them peace and mental stability as an alternative to nurturing healthy familial, platonic or romantic relationships.

Pet keeping is a fast-growing lifestyle trend in Kenya. Pet owners choose animals based on their breed and pedigree, as the pets reflect the owner’s lifestyle and reputation. In essence, the pet takes the place of either a husband, parent or child.

To some pet owners, popularly referred to as pawrents, keeping animals in their homes offers psychological benefits they would not have obtained from human interactions. This is the opinion held by Nairobi-based Counseling Psychologist Mr Nelson Saitu who states that pet companionship has upsides that human relationships can’t offer.

“Sometimes pets are prescribed for war veterans to calm them down, and even in our practice, prescribing pets to clients is becoming a thing. Mainly it is about the comfort they offer. Pets can be very soothing, loving and non-judgmental. They don’t talk back or project their values, culture or religion on their owners, and don’t speak without understanding situations, or give nonverbal reactions. Pets help a person reconnect with themselves through self-expression,” says Mr Saitu.

Mr Abdikarim Hussein, a New Media journalist and social butterfly with a following of 21,000 on Facebook, is a pawrent. Occasionally, he regales his followers with tales of his rescue pet cat, Elvis, including his randy behaviour across the neighbourhood.

“I’ve had Elvis for three years now since I rescued him from a drainage culvert. It was so small and I feared he would die of starvation. I live alone and my life changed when I brought him home. For one, he soothes my mind. Whenever you find me at home, I am less stressed especially when Elvis is beside me while watching a movie. I find socialising a bit tasking beyond going to work and occasionally hanging out with my friends outside for a short while. When I get home, I prefer to be alone with Elvis,” said Mr Hussein, an avid member of the Cat Lovers Kenya group.

Additionally, Mr Hussein revealed how Elvis initially disrupted his love life saying, “My relationships with women was affected. I interacted with women who ended up saying they have cat phobias and allergies when they visited my house and found Elvis. But see, Elvis is a permanent fixture in my life. I feel safer with him around and would never get rid of him just to protect a long-term relationship with a woman. A cat’s lifespan is between 10 and 15 years. I feel it would be so hard for a romantic relationship to last that long in this era we live in,” he opines.

But love can be alluring and blinding, just as some decisions can be temporary. Despite Mr Hussein’s opinion that any of his romantic relationships wouldn’t last as long as Elvis’ life, he ended up falling in love with a woman who made peace with the fact that Elvis will always be in his life. He revealed that he first had to see how his girlfriend interacted with Elvis and when she became accepting of the cat, he allowed their relationship to deepen into a serious commitment. The couple is now about to celebrate their first anniversary.

While Elvis initially disrupted Mr Hussein’s love life, in the case of Ms Naomi Mutua, a Public Relations practitioner who pawrents seven cats and fosters and rescues several others, balance continues to be key for her when handling relationships.

“Cats are very interesting animals. They are interesting to observe and be around. They are just different. I can’t really compare the nature of their companionship to the relationships I have with people because humans and pets have different qualities and bring different things to the table.

Read: The pet surgeon: Why you must castrate your pets

I think, more than anything, it is because I grew up around pets. I am comfortable having them in my home. There are times I hang out with people but whenever I see a cat, I will always approach it and try to befriend it.

Animals are less complex and judgmental, but humans have qualities that animals don’t have,” explains Ms Mutua.

She went on to reveal that even as she maintains a balance between human and pet interactions, she appreciates that she prefers her cats because they are “all different, have unique personalities and different needs, so it is interesting to hang out and interact with them.”

It is because most pets are adorable, affectionate and loyal that some pawrents end up making unconventional life decisions such as putting love on the back burner and not having children.

In 2018, Boise State University, a public research university in Idaho, America, published a research paper on why people opt to become pet parents. 27 per cent of her respondents turned out to be pet owners who revealed they deliberately chose pets over having children because they perceived their pet companions as emotional, thinking individuals, and this led them to develop a parent identity towards them. They added that they used terms such as ‘parent’, ‘child’, ‘kids’ and ‘guardians’ when referring to their relationships with their pets.

The research also found that in modern societies across the world, instances of people choosing to be child free encouraged the increase of pet parents.

Kelvin Okumu, a Nairobi based media company owner, is a pet parent to two white cats, Snow, aged four, and Flick, aged a year and a half. Confirming that his relationship status is “as single as a dollar bill”, he revealed that he loves his cats more than some people in his life, and that he is overly concerned with the wellbeing and safety of his pets.

“I love my pets more than some people out here. People can disappoint you and break your heart but a pet that loves you will not. My pets are my life. They don’t satisfy the place of human companionship but they fill an emotional void. For instance, I do feel like I’m needed and loved while at home. They keep me grounded,” states Mr Okumu.

Read: How a pet makes you happy

He adds that he is currently single and searching, but his choice of a partner will be determined by whether the potential romantic partner is accepting of pets. This is based on a personal experience where he decided “anyone who is cruel to pets is a huge red flag” and would never remain in his life.

“My decision to keep pets dictates how I live. For example, I can never choose a life partner who doesn’t like pets and would never want anyone to make me choose between them and my pets. I will always pick my pets over anyone else. There are four billion women out here, I can get one who loves pets, right? They dictate my life a lot, even where I live in Nairobi. Is an apartment pet friendly? If not, I leave,” continued Mr Okumu.

He reiterates that he is open to a relationship but quickly adds that he is also okay with being single for the next 10 years as long as his cats are around. In other words, intimate relationships are not a priority for him right now.

He further explained that his pets afford him companionship and peace of mind especially when he returns home and finds them waiting for him and needing his attention, which helps him relieve the day’s stress.

“Any cat parent will tell you they consider their pet as part of their family. Every time I remember I have some animals somewhere waiting for me to get home, it gives me peace. There are times I get home exhausted, and I find them at the door, eager for my attention. I would recommend pets to anyone who is stressed about life,” Mr Okumu says.

But pawrenting comes with financial implications. Some pawrents spend lavishly on their animals in terms of healthcare, feeding, housing and travel. The Royal Pets is a Kahawa Sukari-based pet lodge in Nairobi. Its founder, Mr Roy Oliver Oduor, also sells high end pet accessories and caters to his clients’ pet import and export needs. He has a group of pawrents who are quite ‘extra.’

“I have seen clients who treat their pets as their only family. They are not interested in conventional relationships like marriage or parenting. I find that they are different from other pet owners who have families because they go to every length to ensure their pets have everything they need to be comfortable. They travel with the pets everywhere, except to work,” explained Mr Oduor.

Read: How a pet makes you happy

“In terms of cost of accessories, it depends on what the pet is getting. Modern food dispensers cost about Sh32,000. They are expensive because they are automatic and they feed the pets on time when the owner is not around. Kennels and travel cages are also quite pricey. Big travel cages for dogs can cost between Sh70,000 and Sh85,000 and kennels made of plastic can go for up to Sh90,000. Pet carriers cost upwards of Sh85,000. They are costly because they can be carried into the plane, so there are aviation standards that must be incorporated,” added Mr Oduor.

A pet stay at his lodge costs an average of Sh1,300 a night, and Mr Oduor may also be requested to handle the pets’ veterinarian visits. He says his clients pay Sh3,000 for consultations at the vet, while treatment costs anywhere between Sh5,000 and Sh10,000 per trip.

Clients who are more attached to their pets end up spending more on their pets’ vet visits compared to pet owners with families. In his opinion, such attached pet owners end up spending much more on animals to ensure their longevity than what a parent would spend on their child.

But what makes some people become too attached to pets to the point of shunning interactions with humans? Psychologist Mr Saitu explains that in some instances, people turn to pets as a source of comfort after experiencing trauma or abuse.

“Anyone coming out of traumatic experiences with human beings mostly doesn’t want to bond with humans anymore. I would understand that.

I experienced the worst of human beings when I was young and for a very long time, I kept pets. In my adult life, I haven’t kept any because of apartment rules that prohibit pet keeping. But in my rural home I keep cats and dogs.

Read: Travelling with a pet? It’s not as straightforward

“I understand why people do it. Pets love you and they know not to disturb you when they sense you are not in a good mood. People turn to pets because they see that pets will not hurt or betray or cheat on them like human beings did. They don’t talk back or give unsolicited advice,” explained Mr Saitu.

Mr Saitu advises pet owners to find balance between pet keeping and maintaining human relationships, or else they run the risk of forming negative attachments to animals and missing out on the wisdom imparted in human interactions.

“This negative attachment may have a calming effect on a pet owner’s nervous system but pets are not meant to take care of your problems. They are meant to give you a safe space so you can find solutions to your problems. Pet owners who fail to find solutions to their life challenges become over reliant on the animals. This can affect their confidence and self-esteem. Therapy might be needed because we are trained to listen to and help such individuals overcome psychological issues that drove them to negative attachments to pets.”

"Dear men, seeking your wife’s opinion doesn’t make you a lesser man","I read an anecdote about identical twin boys, *Kevin and *Zach, who turned out vastly different when they became adults. Kevin took up a career in finance, eventually transitioning into an employer after setting up a business.

In addition, he was a committed husband and father, involved in every aspect of his children’s lives, a loving husband who invested his time in growing his relationship with the wife of his youth and well respected for his community involvement and mentorship of the young people.

As for Zach, their mother would describe him, not with words, but with a deep sigh, followed by that sound that African mothers make when a child or a husband has caused them long suffering, that neither fasting, prayers, nor threats have worked to cause a change.

Zach was lost in alcoholism, and his debauchery made his wife pack up and leave. He ended up losing his job, and were it not for his twin, he would have lost his house too. Unlike Zach, Kevin never touched alcohol.

A talk show host invited both brothers to feature in a show. Zach barely managed to get a bath and put on some clean clothes, let alone brush away the alcohol breath, while Kevin appeared looking spark and sharp.

Their stark biological resemblance was not enough to cover their equally striking, different physical appearance. The talk show host, after introducing the well-known twin, Kevin, asked him, “You have made a lot of impact in our county. Who inspires you?” Kevin paused, then said, “Our dad.”

Turning to Zach, the interviewer asked him. “What about you Zach, who inspires you?” Without losing a beat, Zach replied, “Our dad.” “Oh…but…” the interviewer attempted to hide her surprise, but the twins came to her rescue. In the uncanny way of the twins, they simultaneously said, “Our father was an alcoholic.”

My people say it is better to sire a ngiti - an obstinate, strong-willed child - than a fool (kia). A person whose folly cannot be redeemed. They are unteachable. They listen to no one and in their ignorance and folly bring destruction. It is worse when folly is in a husband since leadership is expected of him, both from a spiritual and cultural perspective.

In our patriarchal society, some husbands will never listen to their wives. They disregard any idea generated by the wife and will not seek their wife’s opinions even in matters of critical family decisions.

They make ill-informed decisions, forgetting that the other half of the gender owns half of the wisdom. On the other hand, a husband who listens to his wife connects plugs into a mystical power.

A woman’s intuition and laser focus on the finer details are what a man needs to enrich his eagle’s view of an idea. But like the Biblical Nabal, whose name means fool, he will not listen to his wife even when the king’s wrath or favour is at their doorstep.

Like our twins, Kevin and Zach, there are two types of people on our planet. On one hand, are the teachable types who look at situations, interrogate them, dissect the outcomes, and become intentional in using those lessons in their lives. The Kevins of our planet end debilitating cycles and leave great legacies.

On the other hand, are the Zachs who will copy-paste, and regurgitate what they watched growing up, never unlearning, and relearning. They perpetuate the ills and perfect the art while at it. Our father was abusive? I will be worse than him. When I cough, my kids, wife, and even the roaches will scamper, just like our father did.

Zachs transfers trauma like a baton, creating the phenomena of ‘family and generational curses.’ It is better to sire a stubborn child than a fool who cannot learn. A strong-willed child might be difficult to parent, but in their stubbornness is a boldness that will lead them towards untrodden paths.

They question the norms. They do not buy into societal dictates. They break barriers. They innovate. They leave a mark. They do not listen to naysayers and when they do, it is to use the negative talk as fuel to energise their intentions.

Most importantly, a strong-willed child is teachable and malleable. They are not scared of being different, because their sense of self-awareness is a daily curiosity, which means, they are always learning, always growing, and turning out better, for themselves and their families.

 ,"Step into the world of modern parenting, where a quiet revolution is taking place: the shift from full-time nannies to day burg nannies. This change hasn’t just been influenced by schedules and availability, it is a profound reflection of evolving lifestyles, parenting priorities and a new understanding of what it means to balance work and family.

But what really drives parents to choose day burgs over live-in nannies? From the desire for more flexible childcare solutions to concerns about privacy and the importance of socialisation for children, we explore the multifaceted reasons behind this growing trend. It is a narrative of new choices, emerging preferences, and a reimagining of childcare in today's fast-paced world.

Read: The silent suffering of domestic workers

Meet Gladys Wainaina, a mother of a one-year-old infant. Right from the beginning, even before she gave birth, she was more inclined towards walk-ins than full-time nannies.

Gladys Macharia, a mother of one, has never employed a full-time nanny.

Her decision to choose a daytime nanny over a live-in nanny was driven by a desire to preserve private and intimate family moments. Additionally, she harboured concerns about full-time nannies potentially sharing personal information with neighbours.

""You see, the moment you let them in, they will see almost all sides of you and your husband. For instance, I really fear them sharing our misunderstandings with our neighbours,"" says Gladys.

Coupled with her desire for privacy, her decision was also influenced by a scare stemming from a troubling experience a friend had with a full-time nanny. This incident reinforced her preference for a daytime nanny.

""This nanny crept out of the house late at night, leaving the gas open. With this in mind, I imagined a disagreement taking place during the day between me and her, only for her to do something that would hurt us in retaliation. I shiver just thinking about it,"" she explains.

Additionally, the news about the chilling death of Kilifi County Chief Officer, Rahab Karisa, at the hands of her live-in house-help, reinforced Gladys’ decision never employ a full-time nanny.

However, in spite of this, her journey with dayburgs has not been without hiccups along the way.

""The very first time, after I delivered my child around October 2022, my house-help requested that I let her travel in early December since she wanted to visit her children for a week. She brought in a friend to step in for her, but she was not a good worker. She only pretended to be working when she saw me,"" she narrates.

Tired of the substandard work, and the failed promise of return of the first dayburg, Gladys looked for another help.

""The first house-help returned shortly after I hired someone else and begged me to reinstate her, but I refused, unfortunately, the one that replaced her had side hustles that made it impossible to give my house enough attention, so I sacked her,” she says.

She eventually got another, whom she has been with up to date.

""She comes to my home only three times a week to clean the house, clothes and shoes,"" explains Gladys.

Like her, Gloria Muthoni, a mother of two, aged three and two, has always preferred dayburgs to full-time nannies. This she attributes to having personal reservations as far as her ‘me-time’ is concerned.

Though she enjoys the help that comes with having someone assist you with household chores, Gloria feels that night-time is her designated time to fully relax and not have to behave in a certain way because there is another adult in the house.

""I've always been of the idea that it is important to have a healthy work-life balance, which is difficult when you have a full-time nanny because you will have pulled them away from their world, and they have to adjust to your world in every way. They have to conform themselves to your schedule, rules and way of life generally,"" she elaborates.

An engineer with a strict 8am to 5pm schedule, those nine hours are fully dedicated to her employer's needs, and it is only after she clocks out from work that she sets aside her professional responsibilities and wears her mom/wife hat.

Gloria notes that all the dayburgs she has had so far have a different personality from hers.

""Do not get me wrong, there are times we can chit chat, but only to a certain extent to avoid breeding familiarity.""

Despite their differences, she goes out of her way to ensure a smooth coexistence. During the day, when her dayburg is present, Gloria is careful to create a comfortable atmosphere, permitting her to carry out her chores without supervision and occasionally engaging in conversation, especially if she is working from home.

The daily routine is structured so that her workday wraps up by 4.30pm.

""If she finishes her work earlier than this, she looks for something else to do, but if I'm around, maybe on leave or even working from home, I release her early,"" she adds.

But there is a downside to such an arrangement, such as being unable to attend work-related events outside office hours, for example.

“Also, whenever she has issues, either domestic or, say, when one of her children is sick, I have to fill in the gap, which becomes difficult when I'm extremely swamped by work. At first, it was happening too frequently, eventually, we agreed that on days when she needed to care for her child, she would bring her with her to work, unless she was hospitalised.”

Though this arrangement places more responsibility on her, Gloria says that accommodating her dayburg’s needs allows her to ensure her work is done, even as she tends to her child.

Unlike Gladys and Gloria, Peris Mwangi, a mother of two, a three-year-old and a one-year-old, has experienced both groups of house helps.

At first, she had a full-time nanny whom she stayed with for two years until her familiarity bred contempt.

""She became disrespectful and contemptuous towards me and I let her go,"" she begins.

For Peris, the straw that broke the camel's back was when the said nanny posted ill things about her on social media, besides bad-mouthing her to her in-laws.

""When we would go visit my in-laws, she would come along, eventually she got to know them and they would communicate. I got to know about it, but the last straw was when she started to constantly post on social media how hard her life was,"" says Peris, adding that before this, the house-help would post photos of her children on social media, something she did not approve of.

""The first time I saw my child on her social media account, I asked her to pull the video down and warned her against repeating it, but she kept doing it,"" she says.

After terminating her contract, Peris says that hiring another full-time nanny briefly crossed her mind but she quickly discarded it and opted for a dayburg instead.

""I thought and still hold the opinion that it makes more sense to be more independent as a family. When you live fulltime with an employee, you are bound to lock horns from time to time,” she explains.

Drawing from her experience, Peris believes that a harmonious relationship is more likely with a dayburg since at the end of the day, everyone retreats to their loved ones.

Additionally, there is less time overlap between the employer and the employee, since each one of them is not in the business of the other.

""Her relationship with us involves reporting in the morning, doing the household chores, tending to and feeding the children, and then leaving once we get home from work,"" she explains, but like other mums who prefer such an arrangement, one of her challenges is having to step up more in the running of the household, alongside her responsibilities at work.

Peris attributes her good and respectful relationship with her dayburg to mutual respect and offering fair compensation.

 ,"Step into the world of modern parenting, where a quiet revolution is taking place: the shift from full-time nannies to day burg nannies. This change hasn’t just been influenced by schedules and availability, it is a profound reflection of evolving lifestyles, parenting priorities and a new understanding of what it means to balance work and family.

But what really drives parents to choose day burgs over live-in nannies? From the desire for more flexible childcare solutions to concerns about privacy and the importance of socialisation for children, we explore the multifaceted reasons behind this growing trend. It is a narrative of new choices, emerging preferences, and a reimagining of childcare in today's fast-paced world.

Meet Gladys Wainaina, a mother of a one-year-old infant. Right from the beginning, even before she gave birth, she was more inclined towards walk-ins than full-time nannies.

Her decision to choose a daytime nanny over a live-in nanny was driven by a desire to preserve private and intimate family moments. Additionally, she harboured concerns about full-time nannies potentially sharing personal information with neighbours.

""You see, the moment you let them in, they will see almost all sides of you and your husband. For instance, I really fear them sharing our misunderstandings with our neighbours,"" says Gladys.

Coupled with her desire for privacy, her decision was also influenced by a scare stemming from a troubling experience a friend had with a full-time nanny. This incident reinforced her preference for a daytime nanny.

""This nanny crept out of the house late at night, leaving the gas open. With this in mind, I imagined a disagreement taking place during the day between me and her, only for her to do something that would hurt us in retaliation. I shiver just thinking about it,"" she explains.

Additionally, the news about the chilling death of Kilifi County Chief Officer, Rahab Karisa, at the hands of her live-in house-help, reinforced Gladys’ decision never employ a full-time nanny.

However, in spite of this, her journey with dayburgs has not been without hiccups along the way.

""The very first time, after I delivered my child around October 2022, my house-help requested that I let her travel in early December since she wanted to visit her children for a week. She brought in a friend to step in for her, but she was not a good worker. She only pretended to be working when she saw me,"" she narrates.

Tired of the substandard work, and the failed promise of return of the first dayburg, Gladys looked for another help.

""The first house-help returned shortly after I hired someone else and begged me to reinstate her, but I refused, unfortunately, the one that replaced her had side hustles that made it impossible to give my house enough attention, so I sacked her,” she says.

She eventually got another, whom she has been with up to date.

""She comes to my home only three times a week to clean the house, clothes and shoes,"" explains Gladys.

Like her, Gloria Muthoni, a mother of two, aged three and two, has always preferred dayburgs to full-time nannies. This she attributes to having personal reservations as far as her ‘me-time’ is concerned.

Though she enjoys the help that comes with having someone assist you with household chores, Gloria feels that night-time is her designated time to fully relax and not have to behave in a certain way because there is another adult in the house.

""I've always been of the idea that it is important to have a healthy work-life balance, which is difficult when you have a full-time nanny because you will have pulled them away from their world, and they have to adjust to your world in every way. They have to conform themselves to your schedule, rules and way of life generally,"" she elaborates.

An engineer with a strict 8am to 5pm schedule, those nine hours are fully dedicated to her employer's needs, and it is only after she clocks out from work that she sets aside her professional responsibilities and wears her mom/wife hat.

Gloria notes that all the dayburgs she has had so far have a different personality from hers.

""Do not get me wrong, there are times we can chit chat, but only to a certain extent to avoid breeding familiarity.""

Despite their differences, she goes out of her way to ensure a smooth coexistence. During the day, when her dayburg is present, Gloria is careful to create a comfortable atmosphere, permitting her to carry out her chores without supervision and occasionally engaging in conversation, especially if she is working from home.

The daily routine is structured so that her workday wraps up by 4.30pm.

""If she finishes her work earlier than this, she looks for something else to do, but if I'm around, maybe on leave or even working from home, I release her early,"" she adds.

But there is a downside to such an arrangement, such as being unable to attend work-related events outside office hours, for example.

“Also, whenever she has issues, either domestic or, say, when one of her children is sick, I have to fill in the gap, which becomes difficult when I'm extremely swamped by work. At first, it was happening too frequently, eventually, we agreed that on days when she needed to care for her child, she would bring her with her to work, unless she was hospitalised.”

Though this arrangement places more responsibility on her, Gloria says that accommodating her dayburg’s needs allows her to ensure her work is done, even as she tends to her child.

Unlike Gladys and Gloria, Peris Mwangi, a mother of two, a three-year-old and a one-year-old, has experienced both groups of house helps.

At first, she had a full-time nanny whom she stayed with for two years until her familiarity bred contempt.

""She became disrespectful and contemptuous towards me and I let her go,"" she begins.

For Peris, the straw that broke the camel's back was when the said nanny posted ill things about her on social media, besides bad-mouthing her to her in-laws.

""When we would go visit my in-laws, she would come along, eventually she got to know them and they would communicate. I got to know about it, but the last straw was when she started to constantly post on social media how hard her life was,"" says Peris, adding that before this, the house-help would post photos of her children on social media, something she did not approve of.

""The first time I saw my child on her social media account, I asked her to pull the video down and warned her against repeating it, but she kept doing it,"" she says.

After terminating her contract, Peris says that hiring another full-time nanny briefly crossed her mind but she quickly discarded it and opted for a dayburg instead.

""I thought and still hold the opinion that it makes more sense to be more independent as a family. When you live fulltime with an employee, you are bound to lock horns from time to time,” she explains.

Drawing from her experience, Peris believes that a harmonious relationship is more likely with a dayburg since at the end of the day, everyone retreats to their loved ones.

Additionally, there is less time overlap between the employer and the employee, since each one of them is not in the business of the other.

‘The Game Master' who is giving adults a chance to be young again,"1. How did the idea of starting game nights for adults begin?

Divinely, to say the least. What started as a catch-up session after many years away from a longtime friend (MC Kibunjah) turned into a brainstorming meeting which birthed many great ideas. At the time, he had a partnership with a venue and coincidentally I was looking for somewhere to host my upcoming birthday celebration. The birthday celebration ended up being a ‘Game Night’ themed evening where friends and family brought their favourite board games to play with each other, catch up and eat cake. What we did not anticipate is the fun people would have, and in this day and age, the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) we would create by posting on our individual Instagram pages. One Instastory led to another and before we knew it, everyone had a plus one at the next event, some bringing up to three guests. We realised there was a great desire for memorable experiences and we became intentional about curating such events. The rest, as they say, is history.

2. What have you observed from watching adults attend fun days and let loose?

I love games because they encourage authenticity. It is hard to pretend to be someone else when playing. It is always beautiful to see people walk into an event looking very serious and watching them mellow into their truest selves. We are currently living in a fast-paced world so I love that we are becoming more intentional about carving out time to take care of ourselves and sometimes that means unplugging ourselves from adulting and all the responsibilities it comes with for a few hours. People leave the event dirtier, happier and most importantly, lighter from having left all their burdens on the bouncing castle.

3. How did you turn it into a business?

Let us just say that as time went by there was a growing need for the authentic energy we brought, which created business opportunities. There are also several costs attached to events, hence the need for resources.



4. How has being the ‘Game Master’ changed your life?

Oh wow, I could go on forever about how my life has changed. The biggest win has been the meaningful connections and new friendships I’ve made with like-minded people who are just as competitive and outgoing. Over time we have created a community that feels like family and that to me is the most gratifying part. I am also continually learning so much given the research I do to prepare trivia questions, and I enjoy the process.

5. What kind of activities are most popular among adults?

It is hard to list specifics as most of the activities we currently do are as continually suggested or requested by our community, for example, water sports at our most recent daytime event called Memory Lane. We enjoy giving people a different experience at each event and keep ticking off old requests and receiving new ones. We’ve even ticked off rodeo bull riding. What’s next? We love to explore new suggestions!

6. Why is it important for adults to play?

The rat race will never stop unless we pause it. We spend the first half of our lives wondering why it is taking so long to grow up, and then spend the other half wishing we had the freedom, time and energy we took for granted when we were younger. Now is a great time to enjoy the present and make full use of what is left to create lifetime memories. All work and no play…? Exactly.

7. How do you juggle all these different roles?

I too wonder sometimes. I like to think of them as God-given gifts that I get to enjoy, but also have a responsibility to utilise. It has taken a while for me to gain balance and I am not there yet but wearing one hat at a time and showing up fully in the moment helps. Creating time and asking for help when stretched is also essential. I am blessed to have a wonderful support system. Plus, I want my daughter to grow up and say, “Yeah, my mum did that.”

"US SEnator Tim Scott, who ran for president, endorses Donald Trump","A US senator who sought this year's Republican presidential nomination endorsed Donald Trump on Friday in a boost to the former leader's bid to secure his party's backing to retake the White House.

Senator Tim Scott appeared on stage with the ex-president at a rally in New Hampshire, whose residents vote in the state's primary on Tuesday.

""I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of these United States, president Donald Trump!"" said Scott, who was visiting the northern state during a bitter cold snap, to a chorus of cheers.

""We need Donald Trump,"" Scott said. ""We need a president who unites our country.""

The South Carolina lawmaker was in the race for the nomination until November 12 when he withdrew, declining to endorse any other candidate.

He had hoped to become the first Black Republican president, but struggled to rise above the pack in the party's crowded field.

Regularly polling in sixth place among Republican primary candidates, the 58-year-old drew only around two to three percent of the vote, according to the RealClearPolitics average of major opinion polls.

His backing should boost Trump's so-far dominant effort to fend off challenges for the nomination from former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

The endorsement is likely a bitter pill for Haley, who is from Scott's home state and served as its governor.

CNN reported that Trump had been in discussions with Scott to secure his backing before South Carolina holds its primary election on February 24, but that the announcement was brought forward after Haley saw a bounce in support.

""He's a fantastic man,"" the scandal-plagued Trump said of Scott. ""Having his endorsement means a lot.""

""We have to unify. We have to go after these crazy people that we're dealing with,"" he added, before launching into fierce critiques of Haley.

During his campaign, Scott frequently underlined his Christian faith and the conservative values he learned growing up in a poor, single-parent household.

He was one of five Republicans appearing in the third televised Republican debate last November, as challengers for the nomination sparred over Ukraine, China, abortion and the future of the party.

Scott has expressed no interest in becoming a running mate to any of the remaining candidates, saying that being vice president ""has never been on my to-do list for this campaign.""

 ,"The pain of being abandoned by a father can only be understood by those who have grown up without a dad.

Daughters are particularly affected by the absence of a father figure at home, and often they find themselves turning to unhealthy habits in an attempt to fill the void.

This week, three women open up to their absentee fathers through candid letters they may never send. Their sentiments, heavily blotted with the ink of longing, disappointment, strength and resilience, are their way of releasing pent-up emotions, and expressing the pain that remains deeply etched in their souls.

Read: “Dear husband, this is why I am cheating”

They talk about the confusion, silent tears, lack of confidence and numerous failed attempts to fill the gap left by the people who were supposed to be their heroes, role models and protectors.

These are not just letters, they are the unspoken narratives of girls who grew into womanhood without a strong male figure.

Each word is a step forward in their journey of healing. The letters are also a sign of resilience from the daughters who carry a pain very few can understand.



Woman 1: ‘Dad, why do you continue digging the hole we are in?’

Dear dad,

I wish I knew what goes through your mind when you see my siblings and I. What do you feel about us? Do you feel sad about what you have done? Do you even see us in the first place? What do you want? Why are you so good to people out there but indifferent to us? At what point will you realise what you have and are about to lose? Do you know you live in your own world? You drink excessively, cause chaos, and go on with life like nothing happened.

I remember one night in your drunken stupor, you were fighting my mother. I intervened and you hit me so badly. At that moment, you came back to your senses, and really apologised saying, ‘It was not your fight.’ But dad, you made it my fight since I was protecting mum.

We have all made you proud despite the chaos you bring. You have always bragged about my performance but contribute nothing, be it recommending jobs, or even paying fees. Dad, you do nothing yet take the glory.

Read: An open letter to… my lover’s wife

I’m a psychologist and I have dealt with alcoholics. I don’t think you can blame your case on liquor because even when you are sober, I feel some darkness in you.

Mum used to tell me that we were very close when I was a baby. You would change my diapers and even read books to me. That was until I joined high school, and you suddenly became cold and authoritative. You stopped attending school meetups, caring about me…what made you change your attitude towards me, dad?

Do you know to date I talk in my sleep because of what you have made us go through? I have gone through a series of therapy sessions, but that has not gone away.

Dear Dad, this is how your absence affected me

Dear Dad, this is how your absence affected me

We do not ask you for anything. Mum provides but you do make our lives difficult. Drink but do not project your anger on us. Do you know how disturbed I was by the major fallout last year that resulted in us not being in talking terms up to now?

It is normal to lose a job but how you chided me when I lost mine really got to me. You called me names and almost hit me but neighbours intervened. I don’t know whether we will ever talk again because I’m scared of you.

I wonder how I will introduce my future partner to you. At some point I will take someone home. I don’t tell my friends about you in detail. I have been unable to make genuine connections because I feel people feign their true identities. Whenever I feel a connection with someone I find myself withdrawing.

Dad, why do you continue digging the hole we are in? I do not think there is much about my life I want you to know. Yes, you will earn your bragging rights but I do not want my life to be something someone talks about because it makes them look or feel good.

When I do something significant in my life, I want you to celebrate it instead of looking around wondering, “Who can I brag about this to?” Dad, do we mean anything to you or we are just trophies?

I wish you told us, ‘You guys, I don’t love you but you know what, you make me look good. That is all you are in my life for.’ It would be good to know where we stand so that we do not live the rest of our lives wondering what we did or did not do.

Woman 2: ‘When I ran to you, you confidently told me that I was mistaking you for someone else.’

Dear father,

I thought I was okay doing life without you because anyway, you were never there. But that is like a bad dream I can’t seem to wake up from. Your presence still repulses me. When I was nine, you beat me up and told me never to call you ‘father.’ You did not want to see me around you ever since I was young. When mum would ask for any money for my upkeep, you’d start fights and quarrels.

Dad, allow me to jog your mind a little bit. Do you remember passing me on the road? When I ran to you, you confidently told me that I was mistaking you for someone else. That day mum left for about two weeks, what made your brother force me to eat from the floor after some of the food spilled while I was eating?

Luckily, mum left you. But she was not stable. We would hop from one house to another. I was so destabilised growing up. I suffered a lot with my identity. Yes, I have a step-dad but there is some distance between us. I wish you read my diary when I was in high school. Maybe you would have acted accordingly.

I wanted to tell you how I was struggling with maths, and how I was at least trying with chemistry. I would have told you about the boy I met and did not know what to do. Perhaps my relationship with mum would have been better if you were around. I blamed her a lot. I kept wondering how things would have been if we’d have been living with you.

Mum found the diary, by the way, and she gave me this talk about you, which I felt was long overdue. Looking back, it was more of an opportunity for her to vent than me knowing you. You stole so much from me, including stability and confidence. Now as an adult, I am feeling the impact.

Read: Dear Husband: This is why I got a Ben 10

If you were present, maybe I would not have been duped by this guy who told me he loved and cared for me only to dump me while I was pregnant. I wouldn’t have given birth at age 21 or gotten into a series of toxic relationships. Dad, you should have showed me what it means to be properly loved by a man.

In 2016 when I met you, do you remember? I did not even know what to say or do with you. I stretched my hand and you hugged me. Deep down, I felt that was the embrace I had been looking for all my life. I told you that I had a child and although the words did not come out of your mouth, the look of ‘you’ve given birth early just like your mum,’ was all I could read.

When it was time for me to leave, you spoke earnestly about us reuniting and you supporting me in college, which gave me hope. This continued until I asked you to drop me off somewhere not too close to home, so that mum wouldn’t get angry. Your response took me aback. It was so easy for you to blame mum yet you were the one who left. All the excitement I had faded.

You know, we tried maintaining a relationship but it proved impossible. It became mentally taxing because both of you would heap your frustrations on me. So I stopped trying only to show up again in 2018 after you informed me about my step-mother’s sickness and her subsequent death.

From then I wondered whether or not I should maintain contact. I wanted a relationship with you. I didn’t want you to use me as a dumping ground of your frustrations over what my mum did or did not do.’

Woman 3: ‘It hurt me most when I would fall sick and be hospitalised and you never came to visit.’

To my father,

Dad, remember the biscuits you would buy us…those sprinkled with sugar on the top. They are still my favourite, because they bring back happy childhood memories.

After your separation with mum in 2006, I used to cry a lot and ask for you, but you only showed up a year later. I was excited to see you but you left again for another year. Sometimes you never showed up for two years.

You were never present for me. Even calling me and my four siblings happened about once in three months. This messed me up emotionally.

Mum really struggled to provide and meet our non-financial needs. Fortunately, she had just been employed by the government. When I was 10 and mum opened up about what led to your separation, I still had hope of having you in my life, but you were unavailable.

It hurt me most when I would fall sick and be hospitalised and you never came to visit. The separation led to rejection from our relatives. They did not want to be associated with us. We felt so alone!

Some of my friends in school told me they came from broken homes, a path I understood fully but their dads still provided for them. I envied those with present father figures.

To date, I envy any woman who is a daddy’s girl. They always seemed to have more confidence than I and my sisters. Your absence left me struggling with confidence until now. I also struggle with interacting with men. I remember googling a lot of the questions I had on relationships when I started having boyfriends after high-school.

I didn’t know how to interact with men and even now, I struggle to define what I want in my ideal partner. I mistakenly believed that sexual relationships were a way to earn love from a man, but this never healed the emotional void left by your absence.

During my college years, I often turned to sexual relationships in an attempt to fill the emptiness, but this only made things worse. It took time for me to realise that I was misusing sex.

I also struggle to ask the guys I date for money, because I have not seen my dad provide. My mum has always been self-reliant.

Dad, you dented my view of marriage so much that I don’t think I ever want to get married. What if my marriage doesn’t work like mum’s? These are some of the questions that run through my mind.

13 dead in China school fire: state media,"Beijing, China

Thirteen people have died in a school dormitory fire in central China's Henan province, the official Xinhua news agency reported Saturday.

The blaze at the Yingcai School in Henan's Yanshanpu village was reported to the local fire department at 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) Friday night, Xinhua said.

Thirteen people have been confirmed dead, the news agency said, adding that one person was injured.

""Rescuers arrived at the scene quickly and the flames were extinguished at 11:38 p.m.,"" Xinhua said.

The injured survivor ""is currently receiving treatment at the hospital and is in stable condition"", according to Xinhua.

Local authorities are investigating the fire's cause, and at least one person linked to the school has been detained, Xinhua said.

Yanshanpu village lies on the outskirts of Nanyang, a city of nearly 10 million.

Little information about the boarding school is publicly available, though social media videos published earlier showed young children including kindergarteners wearing smocks with the school's logo as well as older children learning calligraphy.

Xinhua did not say how many of the dead were children.

Chinese social media users on Saturday expressed outrage about the fire and called for any safety lapses to be punished.

""It's too scary, 13 children from 13 families, all gone in an instant... if there is no severe punishment their souls will not rest in peace,"" one commenter on the Weibo social site wrote.

Fires and other deadly accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement.

In November, 26 people died and dozens were sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China's Shanxi province.

In July, 11 people died after the roof of a school gym collapsed in the country's northeast.

The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.

In April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to jump out of windows to escape.

After the coal company fire in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the country to ""conduct in-depth investigations of hidden risks in key industries, improve emergency plans and prevention measures"".

"KICD digitises, monetises national drama and Kenya Music Festival performances","The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) has implemented the presidential directive to digitise and monetise the Kenya National Drama and Film Festival (KNDFF) and Kenya Music Festival (KMF) performances.

This was announced on Saturday by KICD CEO Prof Charles Ong'ondo during a two-day national adjudicators workshop held at KICD in Nairobi.

This is meant to generate income for participants, teachers and content creators whose productions are to be showcased at the festivals.

So far, the 2023 KMF Gala in Nakuru has been uploaded to the KICD EDU TV U-Tube and other platforms.

The KNDFF and KMF fraternity as well as the general public have now been given the opportunity through the KICD platform where they can easily access past festival performances online.

The workshop was graced by Prof Ong'ondo, who during his presentation made it clear that the institute was on its way to implementing the President's directive during last year's KMF State Concert in Nakuru.

He also explained the rationalised learning areas in the Competency-Based- Curriculum and urged teachers and trainers to embrace the revised learning areas as indicated in the revised curriculum designs that have been uploaded on the KICD website.

He further explained that the KICD EDU TV YouTube is active with 27,500 subscribers. He revealed that the most viewed video is a Kikuyu folk song by Karima Girls; https://youtu.be/ReoEwr-QEN0?si=X4DKzWTtBud9nZdN

Award-winning playwright Peter Njangi hosts drama icons to party,"Award-winning playwright and director Peter Njangi kicked off the year 2024 by hosting more than 100 thespians at his Sabasaba home in Murang’a County on Saturday.

During the get-together of exchanging ideas and planning, Joseph Murungu, Eric Mukolwe Wekesa, George Murimi Gitau, and John Muchwe took the gathering through exciting episodes of their most memorable pieces on stage.

Murungu caused laughter when he narrated how in a church drama he acted as a goat, but the goat owner on the stage in a fit of characterisation caned him hard, forgetting they were acting. He however said he complained later to their leader.

Murungu is famed for lighting up festivals with productions that give the audience a special food for thought.  In 2019 during the festival held at Kibabii University in Bungoma County, Murungu lit up the hall with his production Riddles of Sangoma.

At the get-together, Wekesa performed a singing game skit amid prolonged laughter from the icons present. The genre is a preserve of the youngest children at the pre-primary level at the National Drama Festival.

Njangi said that the idea of hosting eminent drama icons at a New Year fete was to have them bond together and exchange ideas.

He asked the government to be honouring some of them with end-of-the-year national awards like Presidential Commendation.

Njangi who rose to stardom in 2001 when he wrote and directed a winning play ""The Village Well"" with Kiaguthu Boys High School said the get-together would be annual for all Kenyan thespians.

Mr Njangi is the former Principal of Kiaguthu Boys, Njiris School, and Chief Officer of Murang’a County in charge of Agriculture.

Meanwhile, on January 14, the Kenya Drama and Film Festival adjudicators briefing will be held at KICD, Nairobi.

"KICD digitises, monetises national drama and Kenya Music Festival performances","The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) has implemented the presidential directive to digitise and monetise the Kenya National Drama and Film Festival (KNDFF) and Kenya Music Festival (KMF) performances.

This was announced on Saturday by KICD CEO Prof Charles Ong'ondo during a two-day national adjudicators workshop held at KICD in Nairobi.

This is meant to generate income for participants, teachers and content creators whose productions are to be showcased at the festivals.

So far, the 2023 KMF Gala in Nakuru has been uploaded to the KICD EDU TV U-Tube and other platforms.

The KNDFF and KMF fraternity as well as the general public have now been given the opportunity through the KICD platform where they can easily access past festival performances online.

The workshop was graced by Prof Ong'ondo, who during his presentation made it clear that the institute was on its way to implementing the President's directive during last year's KMF State Concert in Nakuru.

He also explained the rationalised learning areas in the Competency-Based- Curriculum and urged teachers and trainers to embrace the revised learning areas as indicated in the revised curriculum designs that have been uploaded on the KICD website.

Harvard University first black female president resigns amidst scandals,"The president of Harvard University resigned Tuesday after coming under ferocious attack over plagiarism accusations and her response to anti-Semitism on campus amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Claudine Gay was criticised in recent months after reports surfaced alleging that she did not properly cite scholarly sources. The most recent accusations came Tuesday, published anonymously in a conservative online outlet.

Gay was also engulfed by scandal after she declined to say unequivocally whether calling for genocide of Jews would violate Harvard's code of conduct, during testimony to Congress alongside the heads of MIT and the University of Pennsylvania last month.

Gay, who made history as the first Black person to be president of the powerhouse university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said in her resignation letter that she'd been subjected to personal threats and ""racial animus.""

Her downfall comes after the university's governing Harvard Corporation had initially backed her after the public relations disaster of the congressional testimony.

But the body did criticise the university's initial response to the Hamas October 7 attacks that Israel said killed 1,140 people inside Israel and saw around 240 people taken hostage.

Israel's offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed at least 22,185 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.

'Racist vitriol'

More than 70 lawmakers, including two Democrats, demanded her resignation, while several high-profile Harvard alumni and donors also called for her departure.

Still, more than 700 Harvard faculty members had signed a letter supporting Gay and her job had appeared to be safe.

The resignation, first reported by the student-run newspaper the Harvard Crimson, was confirmed shortly after by Gay herself.

""It is with a heavy heart but a deep love for Harvard that I write to share that I will be stepping down as president,"" Gay said in a statement.

Gay also wrote that she had faced threats to her safety and ""racial animus"" in the wake of the furore over her handling of claims of mounting anti-Semitism on campus.

The university's governing Harvard Corporation said that Gay had ""shown remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks.""

""While some of this has played out in the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls. We condemn such attacks.""

In the United States, the anti-Semitism on campus controversy came amid a rise in attacks and violent rhetoric targeting Jews and Muslims, including at universities, since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

The president of another elite Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania, had already been forced to resign.

The House Republican who challenged Gay out during her testimony with the question about whether free speech extended to calling for genocide of Jews celebrated the latest academic's downfall.

""Harvard knows that this long overdue forced resignation of the antisemitic plagiarist president is just the beginning of what will be the greatest scandal of any college or university in history,"" said Representative Elise Stefanik.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a close US ally, has claimed that a ""whopping wave of anti-Semitism"" has ""seeped onto university campuses.""

Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial, has described it as a ""cancer.""

Former student and multi-million-dollar donor Bill Ackman claimed in a letter to Harvard's governing boards that ""President Gay's failures have led to billions of dollars of cancelled, paused, and withdrawn donations to the university.""

Gay, 53, was born in New York to Haitian immigrants and is a professor of political science who in July became the first Black president of 368-year-old Harvard.

""Leadership failure and denial of anti-Semitism have a price. Hope glorious Harvard University learns from this dismal conduct,"" wrote new Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz in response to Gay's departure.

Here are the must-read books from East Africa this January,"East African literature continues to grow and reshape itself in exciting new ways – and 2023 was no exception. The world really did take notice of the region when Tanzanian-British author Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2021. Interest in Gurnah’s work continued last year when he made a homecoming to East Africa.

But it is in Tanzania that Gurnah made a proper homecoming in 2023 – through the first ever Kiswahili translation of Paradise, now out as Peponi.

I am an interdisciplinary scholar with a research focus that cuts across journalism, creative writing, African literature and postcolonial studies. I’m also a big reader of books from the region. My highlights of 2023 range from the masterful Gurnah to stunning newcomers, a bold biography to a pacy memoir.



1. Abdulrazak Gurnah in Kiswahili

Now aged 74, Gurnah has recently headlined a literary festival in Kenya which seeks to foster conversations between and among Anglophone (English-speaking) and Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) Africa. Just the other day in Uganda, his life and work was celebrated by the creative collective Femrite.

But it is in Tanzania that Gurnah made a proper splash through the first ever Swahili translation of his Booker Prize-nominated historical fiction, Paradise, now out as Peponi.

Indeed, Gurnah’s literary interests have always hovered around east Africa, from his seminal Memory of Departure, which chronicles the sojourns of a young immigrant in search of education abroad. Haunted by the life left behind, and roiled by the uncertainties of the new lands, he seeks meaning to his life.

Mkuki Na Nyota

This echoes the author’s own pursuit, after his dislocation from Zanzibar. In his many interviews, Gurnah has maintained that immigrants do not arrive on European shores, or any others, empty handed: they have their unique tales and histories and ways of seeing the world that should enrich their adopted lands.

But it is Paradise, first published in 1994, that propelled Gurnah to international fame, following its nomination for the Booker Prize in the same year. A coming-of-age tale of Yusuf, a lad who is pawned to a merchant to offset his father’s debt, it’s a story that’s at once heart-breaking and spellbinding.

Some critics read the novel as a retake of the Biblical saga of Joseph (Yusuf in Swahili) who is sold into captivity by his envious siblings, while others read it as a parody of Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Whatever the case, Swahili readers who have not encountered the text in other languages are in for a great treat, and Peponi is a good place to start in their exploration of Gurnah’s work.



2. Kenya’s rising star

In Kenya, it was the emergence of a new author, Linda Musita, that caused excitement. Her debut book of short stories called Mtama Road has been well received locally. The seven short stories (although perhaps short-shorts is more appropriate – the book comes in at under 100 pages) are all set on one road in Nairobi’s Parklands.

The protagonists of Musita’s stories all find themselves having to navigate different elements of adulting.



3. Rebirth of the biography

After nearly 30 years of obscurity, the Kenyan biography appeared to enjoy a rebirth this year, with the publication of For The Record: The Inside Story of Power, Politics, Lawmaking & Leadership in Kenya, ghostwritten for Kenya’s defence minister, Aden Duale.

A foreword is authored by the Kenyan president, William Ruto, and it prologues the crux of the story: a peep into the machinations that define Kenyan politics, with a particularly penetrating gaze into the fallout between former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta and his successor.

Unsurprisingly, the book found immediate traction with readers soon after its release in the middle of 2023, following its serialisation in the local press, precipitating five reprints in six months.

Still, the Kenyan biography represents a literary oddity: it’s often staid and formulaic, parroting a predictable trajectory to explain successes, never failures, of politicians and technocrats, as they look back on their lives.

In Duale’s For The Record, we come close to approximating the truth of his political motivations and his quest for power, even though we cannot infer what he intends to do with the power, now that he’s among the most powerful men in the land.

The sprightly diction deployed in the narrative could help buffer readers from the obvious flaws in a story that’s peppered as a rags-to-riches fable, even though his trading parents were people of reasonable means, within their context.



4. Uganda’s action-packed memoir

If the new memoir by the Buganda queen is anything to go by, Uganda took literary candour a notch higher in 2023. In The Nnnabagereka, Queen Sylvia Nagginda Luswata, the journalist-turned-monarch, recalls her eventful journey from New York, where she lived through most of her childhood, to her unconventional dating of Prince Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II of Uganda. The tale includes a proposal via email.

“Dear Sylvia, I think I am ready if you are,” Mutebi is reported to have written to his future wife. Another elliptical line in the memoir records another milestone, thus: “On December 6, 2010, I was blessed with two more girls Jade Nakato and Jasmine Babirye born in Kampala… They’re two amazing kids.”

The phraseology does not indicate if they belong to the Kabaka (or king). A statement from the Buganda king’s office clarified the twins did not receive the special drum sounded to herald the Kabaka’s biological children, which fanned online speculation about their paternity. The royal family is blended as the Kabaka has three other children from three different women.

Here’s hoping 2024 will be just as lively.

Big plans for ailing Mombasa Stadium,"Mombasa County Speaker Aharub Khatri has announced plans to renovate the county stadium this year to ensure is ready to be used for local and international matches.

The long overdue renovation will also include the construction of playgrounds in each of the county’s 30 wards to harness talents from grassroots levels.

“We agreed to make sure that each ward has a seven-a-side playing ground,” said Khatri.

Speaking after the final match of the Kitui Flour Mills Company-sponsored Shibe Fest Beach Cup tournament at Pirates ground on Sunday, Khatri said ward representatives and himself have agreed to make sure the county stadium is renovated and put into use.

“It is a great shame that the renovation of the stadium has not been completed for so many years. We’ve agreed with all Mombasa ward representatives to ensure that the stadium is completed this year so that it can be used to benefit not only the players but even business owners,” said the Speaker.

Khatri said they have been hiring playing grounds in many of the tournaments they sponsored with fans paying entrance fees to watch matches.

“We want our stadium to be ready and utilised in uplifting the standard of play of our youths,” he said.

Khatri said together with ward representatives, they will be working to make sure there is a standard playing ground in each ward and that there will be a seven-a-side field in each ward.

Kitui Flour Mills Company representative Shariff Abdalla said they have sponsored the tournament this time around so that the youths play beach football and raise their talents in the sport.

“We want beach football to become popular in Mombasa and Coast as a whole,” said Abdalla.

The Fetuwe FC won the tournament by beating Sao Paulo 1-0 in a thrilling final match with the lone goal scored by Shafi Dawud.

Fetuwe were awarded a trophy, Sh100,000 in cash and medals to players and officials while Paulo got a cup, Sh70,000 and medals. El Control FC finished third place by defeating Kadzandani FC 2-0 and were awarded a trophy, Sh30,000 and medals.

Kadzandani who finished fourth walked away with a cup, Sh20,000 and medals.

Biographies released in 2023 reveal the rarely seen side of VIPs,"From very personal recollections to revelations of previously unknown facts, the new biographies and autobiographies of 2023 offer rich insights into the workings of the government and the people in charge — plus the chaos that exist at every level.

British writer and biographer Philip Guedalla once noted that biography is “a very definite region bounded on the north by history, on the south by fiction, on the east by obituary, and on the west by tedium”.

His description of the books that tell stories of individuals was spot-on when one considers the biographies released by big names in Kenya in 2023.

Among the persons who released their biographies this year is Issack Hassan, the former chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), who penned a voluminous book titled, Referee of a Dirty Ugly Game: In the Theatre of Kenya’s Elections — an Insider’s Account.

Then there was Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale who went to town with an autobiography, For the Record: The Inside Story of Power, Politics, Lawmaking and Leadership in Kenya.

Former Cabinet minister and nominated senator Beth Mugo also released her memoir, Early Bird, in which she lays bare the story of her life and her odyssey with the country’s echelons of power.

Dr David Silverstein, the physician who treated many VIPs in Kenya, among them former President Daniel Arap Moi and former Attorney-General Charles Njonjo, also released his biography, Heartbeat: An American Cardiologist in Kenya, in 2023.

Then there was the former Head of the Civil Service, Dr Francis Muthaura, who released his memoir, A Moving Horizon.

Others who released biographies are

Reading the works reveals another side to the personalities whose tough side Kenyans are accustomed to seeing on television screens.

For instance, who would have imagined that someone like Beth Mugo, a niece of Kenya’s founding president Jomo Kenyatta, could be conned by land fraudsters? In a chapter where she describes how she fought for public land in Dagoretti when she was the area MP, she says that she once fell prey to cons.

“I have been a victim of land swindling. After taking a loan from Barclays Bank in 1995 to purchase land in Likoni, the land company happened to have a fraudulent scheme and I never got the land after servicing the loan for many years,” she writes.

Dr Silverstein’s book illustrates how the persons we consider larger-than-life have their very human moments. He discloses that he treated former South African president Nelson Mandela in Nairobi in 1990, where he performed a chest X-ray and drew his blood for tests. When he later met Mr Mandela about nine months later, the South African icon told him, “You are a much better doctor than you think. I’m still alive!” Then they laughed and shook hands.

And whereas the public was used to a stoic, often hard-to-please Moi, Dr Silverstein reveals a man who, in his sunset years, got very excited when visiting the burial site of Jesus in Old Jerusalem and who so much treasured a brand of sparkling water sold in Israel that he brought some in Kenya to consume. In his last days, Mr Moi would also regularly watch videotaped sermons of evangelists such as Billy Graham.

How Dr Silverstein became Moi's doctor

How Dr Silverstein became Moi's doctor

Through his description of the last moments of Mr Moi and Mr Njonjo, Dr Silverstein opens the veil into the inevitability of death that applies to all human beings — whether you are a sophisticated, wealthy and well-guarded personality or a random pauper.

“(Mr Njonjo’s) directives on his last days were already known to all of them (his family). He did not want to be hospitalised. He did not want to suffer. Once his condition was irreversible, he wanted to be left to die peacefully,” he writes of Mr Njonjo.

However, Mr Njonjo chose a unique way of departing the earth, perhaps a final edict that he never wanted to be grouped with the mortals.

“He had made it clear that his death should not be announced until after his cremation. He did not want his family to be pressurised by the Kikuyu community to bury him,” writes Dr Silverstein.

Dr Silverstein also reveals his personal tribulations after he was accused of negligence following the death of one-time Chief Justice Zacchaeus Chesoni who was his patient. A reader can feel the relief he felt when Mr Moi, despite the questions about his competence, assured Dr Silverstein that he would remain his doctor. The doctor would later be cleared of any malpractice.

Dr David Silverstain with his memoir ‘Heartbeat: An American Cardiologist in Kenya.’

Mr Muthaura, in his book, discloses some very human challenges that have plagued his life, some that are health-related. The steely career civil servant and diplomat shares about a long health complication from a stomach ulcer that lasted from 1959 to 1972. He also describes the open-heart surgery that he went through in South Africa when he was the Head of Public Service and the Secretary to the Cabinet.

And whereas Kenyans know Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale as an abrasive leader who used to fire from the hip when he was in politics, his book reveals a more timid young man, especially in his formative years. As a Form One student at Garissa High School, he reveals that he used to be bugged by bullies who would take all his money and demand that he make their beds. He, however, found a “godfather” who put an end to his tribulations.

Mr Duale’s book also reveals the harsh life led by Kenya’s elected parliamentarians when they fail to recapture their seats.

How Moi doctor, Dr Silverstein, came to Kenya

How Moi doctor, Dr Silverstein, came to Kenya

“I had seen how some had ended up badly after one term in Parliament,” he writes of young lawmakers, noting that there are also seasoned parliamentarians who are “now broke and needy” and who “idled on the corridors of Parliament begging for lunch or fuel money from the sitting lawmakers”.

“It is not a nice picture for a former prominent leader to be reduced to penury,” he writes.

Then there is Mr Hassan’s book where the former IEBC boss admits that he bore hatred for opposition leader Raila Odinga, the media and several officials following his ouster from office in 2017. Known for his calmness and non-confrontational speeches, Mr Hassan pours his heart out in the “reflections” part of his book.

“I must say that it is also hard not to harbour some resentment against those that you believe persecuted you. For me, they were the Cord (Coalition for Reforms and Democracy) principals led by Raila, the Auditor-General, the media, as well as the chairman and 16 members of the Public Accounts Committee who appended their signatures on the witch-hunt report. You can forgive your enemies, but never forget their names,” writes Mr Hassan.

He also reckons that life changed dramatically after his exit from IEBC.

“You quickly find out who your true friends were, and those whose friendship was with your office, as soon as you exit. Sometimes your call will not be picked up or returned, and you realise that it is not personal. You are no longer in office, and your usefulness to some is over. It may be shocking to realise that many of these people were only fair-weather friends,” he writes.

The books are also a commentary on very human reactions to events. What do you do when a social media post alleges you are languishing in disease whereas it is a big lie? Mr Hassan discloses how he responded to posts about his health; posts that claimed he was suffering after leaving IEBC while it was all a lie.

Read: The history of mistrusting opinion polls

Mr Steadman, in his book, discusses how he handled a situation ahead of the 2007 General Election when lawyer Miguna Miguna, then a diehard of the Orange Democratic Party, became fiery and confrontational during the release of opinion poll results. Ms Mugo, on the other hand, discloses how she reacted to news that she had breast cancer and how she craftily evaded arrest under President Moi for attending an opposition rally in July 1990, while Mr Muthaura reveals how he reacted to news about him being a suspect at the International Criminal Court.

From very personal recollections to revelations of previously unknown facts, the new biographies and autobiographies of 2023 offer rich insights into the workings of the government and the people in charge — plus the chaos that exists at every level.

Peter Nduati named winner of the 2023 Book Prize,"Engineer Peter Nduati is the winner of the 2nd edition of the Afrika Redefined Indie Book Prize. In his book Gooka from the Village to the City, he describes his experiences and his love for the elderly. The ceremony was held at the Alliance Française de Nairobi Multimedia Library on December 15, 2023.

In his acceptance speech, Eng Nduati, 70, said: ""This prize is a challenge to grandfathers and grandmothers. They are sources of wisdom and experience. They are trusted and believed by their grandchildren. We can pass on this wisdom to the grandchildren,"" he said.

""We have an opportunity to instil in them the true values of education, hard work, generosity, respect for elders and integrity, and change the trajectory of this nation,"" he added.

The runner-up was The Leaves of May, a novel by Muthoni Maina, while the second runner-up was Back-Fence Talk and Other Stories by Caroline Kinya Mbaya.

The 2023 winner will receive a cash prize of Sh30,000 which is an increase from 2022 where the winner received Sh20,000.

The award ceremony was presided over by Ms Margaret Lesuuda, Director of Education at the Ministry of Education.

The book, Gooka from the Village to the City, is a memoir that captures the author's daily experiences intertwined with the past, making the narrative both semi-biographical and a social commentary moulded in historical, scientific and mathematical satire.

The winner of the second edition of the Afrika Redefined Indie Book Prize is a writer who exudes energy and vitality for his age.

The prize aims to recognise independently published books by Africans, with a focus on stories that address Africa's present and future (Afro-currency and Afro-futurism).

It is awarded annually and is administered by the Kenyan pan-African publishing house Mystery Publishers.

During the event, Dr Emmanuel Shikuku Tsikhungu of Kenyatta University said, ""As Africans, we should continue to write about ourselves and our cultures because if we do not write ourselves, others will, and the result could be so disastrous"".

The event saw a fusion of art, literature and open mic performance. The audience was entertained by open mic performers Oyamo Richard and Abanu (Bryan Bundi). The guest of honour urged artistes and writers to keep writing to be global citizens as envisaged in the African Union's Agenda 2063 'The Africa We Want'.

Ms Lesuuda also urged writers to write in African languages to preserve our culture.

According to the chairperson of the judges, Lexa Lubanga, who is also the founder of Kenyan Readathon, an annual reading marathon that encourages readers to read only Kenyan writers/books, the winning book must score over 90 per cent (judges' score) in the professional assessment. For a book to be considered good on Afro-currency/Afrofuturism, it must score over 80 per cent. For runners-up, books must score between 80 and 90 per cent in professionalism.

""Different books scored differently; some would be strong in writing style but fail in professionalism and theme; others would be strong in professionalism but fail in theme; while others would be good in theme but fail in writing style and professionalism,"" she said.

""It is therefore up to us to support such initiatives, as it will be a challenge to recognise them without the necessary support, resources and systems,"" appealed Vincent de Paul, CEO of Mystery Publishers.

The speakers encouraged independent writers to invest in their writing, to preserve our (African) art and culture in their works, and to be humble in their endeavours.

""From 2024, the prize will be open to all African writers living on the continent or in the Diaspora,"" said Vincent de Paul.

The Director of Alliance Française de Nairobi, Mr Charles Courdent, said that Alliance Française de Nairobi will continue to support linguistic diversity and self-published authors. In 2023, the Alliance Française de Nairobi supported over 50 book launches by Kenyan self-published authors.

A chat with Wole Soyinka during Chinese literary festival,"“You look well and sprightly,” I say, as we warmly shake hands with Professor Wole Soyinka, 89, the first African, and still only wholly one of negritude extraction, to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.

It is, I believe, fairly common to feel a tremor of intimate recognition on your first glimpse of Wole Soyinka (although, in all fairness, I have met him twice before, at a North American literary festival in 2005, and at the Storymoja Hay Festival of 2014, where he had come to show support after the death, the year before, of diplomat-poet Koffi Awunoor, during the attack at Westgate mall). Like most literate residents of the planet, you have known this presence - calm, professorial, slightly self-ironic - all your reading life.

And now here he is, here we are, at a cosy self-contained lobby at the Grosvenor House in Shanghai, China, with its old world charm and warm and polished and burnished wood décor.

If Wole Soyinka was the interior of a building, he would be this lobby. But he is an institution of world literature, and instantly recognizable – that face with its old lion of literature mane, the intelligent eyes with their slightly quizzical look, but especially that world-famous Wole Soyinka afro, now white, that literally looks like a halo.

“Hallo, again,” he smiles. “I may look well on the exterior, but inside, I do feel incredibly old.”

This Yoruba man from Abeokuta, Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde Soyinka was born in 1934 in Nigeria, and has had quite an eventful life, outside of the literary arts (as poet, playwright and novelist). In 1967, he was sentenced to two years in solitary confinement during the Biafra War by the government of General Yakubu Gowon, for appointing himself a non-State mediator.

The poet Christopher Okigbo, a contemporary of Soyinka, was shot dead during that Civil War, for picking the pistol over the pencil, in a conflict where some chose the bullet over the ballot.

Quarter a century later, Wole Soyinka, although now a Nobel Prize winner and a teacher of literature at the Obafemi Awolowo University would find himself crossing the border on a boda boda. He was a wanted man by another ruling General, Sani Abacha, aka the ‘Butcher of Abuja.’

Having sentenced Professor Soyinka to death in absentia, Abacha went on to hang the famous writer Ken Saro Wiwa in November of 1995, ignoring world pressure to release the man of letters. Saro Wiwa’s crime had been to question the environmental exploitation of the Ogoni homelands as Abacha, like an ogre, plundered it for its oil. By the time of his poison death in 1998, Abacha had embezzled over $3 billion (Sh500 billion) from state coffers.

In 1999, Wole Soyinka made a triumphant return back to Nigeria.

And now here we are, in the December of 2023, as the only African participants in this Chinese literary festival in Shanghai that seeks to answer the question of the Arts in the Age of ‘AI.’

Read: First tour of Nigeria and a moment with Prof Wole Soyinka

“I reject the term ‘Artificial Intelligence.’ All knowledge is a creation of human beings, including language, so that as a Yoruba, I will not presume to translate what AI means in English, as it is not my original language. I only have ‘artificial knowledge’ of the English language, do you see?”

I can see how this conversation is life imitating art intimating artificiality of language, but I also do know that Soyinka has been a visiting professor at both Oxford and Cambridge, those most English of places that not only compete in boat races but in giving us dictionaries (I’m Oxford).

As well as having actually taught for stints in American universities like Cornell, of course Emory, Loyola in LA, as well as UoN (University of Nevada) with visits to Duke, Harvard and Yale.

“Shall we call it not ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ but Surrogate Intelligence?” Wole Soyinka suggests.

“Chatbots, for instance, are the work of human beings, and not an act of science by AI. It did not fall like manna from the heavens, it was programmed by man. So I celebrate the human intelligence that created Surrogate Intelligence.”

“You do not see it, at all, as a threat in any way?”

Read: Everyone says Achebe is father of African literature, except Soyinka

“We can make up new phrases as we go along, like this Surrogate Intelligence, just as humans create new scientific systems as they go on along,” Soyinka says, deftly sidestepping the question. “I believe you are old enough to remember when telephone conversations were conducted through telephone operators?”

I nod, thinking of the mostly female voices from the 1980s at some Tele-Posta places across space, as one held on to be connected from a town, another country, to a different continent.

“We had fixed locations,” Wole Soyinka says. “Button ‘A’, Button ‘B,’ Button ‘C,’ Button ‘D,’ etc.

Robots do not suffer from insomnia, so they eventually replaced the Operators. Then we replaced the entire phone system. From the static, we went mobile. Satellite. Star Systems. Now we are our own operators, thanks to our artificial knowledge(s) and surrogate intelligence.”

When I remove my smartphone for the inevitable ‘selfie’ with Wole Soyinka, he becomes courteously and objectionably old school.

“Sorry, son, I don’t do selfies!”

Instead he asks the Polish Professor Dariuz Tomasz Lebioda who is there with a proper camera, carried like a bazooka, if he could do us the courtesy of an old school ‘photograph,’ us being Prof Soyinka, myself and well known Chinese poet Zhao Si, whom as Vice President of the European Medal of Poetry and Art, is there to present Wole Soyinka with the Homer Medal for Literature, for being the ‘African Shakespeare across literary genres for many decades,’ beginning in the mid-sixties with the play ‘The Lion and the Jewel,’ the novel ‘The Interpreters’ and ‘Poems from Prison.’

Just the day before, Professor Soyinka had been awarded the Golden Magnolia Poetry Award ‘for poetry that speaks to our innate humanity’ by the President of the Arts Council, Mr. Zhao Lihong.

“It is not the best of times in the world,” Soyinka says. “But then when could we last speak otherwise?”

Looking back, indeed, from the current conflicts in Ukraine by Russian invaders, the conflagration in the Congo, civil war in Sudan and Israel’s pulverization of the Gaza Strip, there are many things gone wrong with the world today, or as sings Steve Tyler in ‘Living on the Edge,’ “there something wrong with the world today, the lightbulb’s getting dim, there’s meltdown in the sky” (that one’s prophetically about global warming and climate change today)

“Still, in-spite of the fault lines, we exuberantly celebrate Humanity,” the Nobel laureate says, and then frowns. “What is human? When does ‘human’ happen? Poetry is simply the quest for ‘Human,’ and art the quest for humanity – across ideology, race, gender and religion – in us all.”

After a short pause, he adds: “It is a challenge for the poet, the writer, the playwright – and therefore our creative mission.”

“What do these awards, the Golden Magnolia, the Homer Medal of Literature, mean to you?”

“If I were to give voice to these awards,” Wole Soyinka says, “it would be that any honour be dedicated to the embattled children of the Middle East, the endangered species of the future.”

Around 12,000 infants and children have been killed by Israeli air and artillery attacks on the Gaza Strip since early October, with many dying trapped under the debris of destroyed buildings.

“The State that endangers these kids, and the States that are united in their support of it, the former must ask ‘Is what we are doing human?’ and the latter then have a fundamental responsibility to guide them back into the renewal of that quest, of what it is to be human.”

The inevitable black SUV is outside to take Professor Wole Soyinka for the next engagement.

The Polish Professor, Dariusz Tomasz Lebioda, is curious as to where Prof Wole Soyinka keeps his Nobel Prize for Literature medal.

“Actually, I lost it,” Soyinka reveals.

“What do you mean ‘lost’ it, sir?” Zhao Si cannot help it.

“To be more accurate, my publisher lost it,” Wole Soyinka says, graciously not revealing which of his many publishers. “They borrowed it, maybe to represent me in absentia, for an event. It disappeared, completely ...”

“Have you tried looking for it on e-Bay, Prof?” I risk the joke.

The Nobel Lit Laureate regards me with a wry smile. “I keep meaning to ask the academy in Stockholm to send me a replacement,” then he shrugs at his wife Folake Doherty as if to say ‘I forget.’

She is his third wife, his first one having been a British writer British Dixon that Wole Soyinka married young in 1958, with them divorced four years later.

He met his current wife when she was in university as a student, and he was a professor there.

They married in 1989, and it has been a lifelong union of love and companionship, a marriage that has borne three sons, and in spite of the three decades in age that separate them, they seem inseparable, so third time’s a charm.

It is also she who reminds me to get the autograph of the Soyinka novel I have been carrying, “Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth” (and, no, it has no Finns in it), the book he wrote when Covid-19 had them in isolation, and his first novel in almost 50 years.

Later I will look at the book dedication above his magisterial and sweeping signature – “to the memory of DELE GIWA, investigative journalist, and BOLA IGE, politician sans pareil, both cut down by Nigerian assassins. And to FEMI JOHNSON, a thorough rounded human being and rare species of the creative joie de vivre,” and realise the trio embody Wole Soyinka’s interests – creativity, politics and the kind of investigative journalism that exposes the ills of Africa.

After all, it is the continent with the unhappiest people on the planet ...

“See you in 2032,” I say, by way of farewell, to Wole Soyinka. Seeing his perplexed look, I add: “It seems I get to see you every nine years, sire. 2005. 2014. 2023 ...”

“Life is mathematical, is it not?” and then we three are waving at our reflections on the rolled up windows of the car taking the Soyinkas to the poetry recital at No.300 Hehuan Rd, Pudong.

He will read his poem there, that one that goes “the human gaze be raised skyward/ not in fear or supplication, but to hail the fall of those who spew, what in its after-burn becomes ashes ...”

They will not join us that evening for the night cruise on the Huangpu River that the Shanghai International Poetry Festival has arranged for the 22 literary folks invited to this world bund.

Going to get my jacket that evening at the Jin Jang hotel, for it is chilly if beautiful in reception and perception, like some women, that Huangpu river in December, I come across an item on Al Jazeera. The Israeli Defence Forces, as they search for Hamas terrorists, have attacked Al Shifa hospital and killed dozens, many of them children.

Aghast, I will pick the pen and paper by my writing table in that Shanghai suite, and with Soyinka’s recited poem earlier that afternoon still echoing in my mind, write my own continuation: “...vessels that bear man, and Artificial Doom/ that seed what hews the human, post-humus / and in their aftermath (math of Hamas), a catacomb of Gaza’s children’s tombs.”

COP28: Big win for Africa as Sultan Al Jaber ensures developed countries are accountable on adaptation,"In Dubai, UAE

COP28 President Dr Sultan Al Jaber's final text sets a long-term goal for climate resilience and for the first time prioritises key issues raised by the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on water, food, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, poverty and culture.

After more than 24 hours of stalemate on the final day of the world's largest climate meeting, which saw the COP28 negotiations go into overtime, the AGN had expressed disappointment and frustration on Tuesday morning.

""Let me reiterate, as we have said before, that adaptation is a key issue for Africa and an outcome on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) was our key demand.

We will not agree on anything here unless Africa's top priorities are met, which for us is a GGA framework. If we are serious about saving lives, livelihoods and protecting ecosystems, then the GGA framework must have ambitious, time-bound targets with clear means to support implementation,"" said Collins Nzovu, Minister of Green Economy and Environment of Zambia and Chair of the AGN.

According to a senior official in the COP28 presidency, who attended a high-level briefing on Wednesday morning and is privy to all the ongoing negotiations but is not allowed to speak on behalf of the presidency, there are three outstanding elements of the final text for Africa.

""We are waiting for the final text to be made official, but I can give you three key things in it.

For the GGA, which the AGN talked about yesterday, the text has set a long-term goal for climate resilience with thematic priorities for the first time, key thematic priorities that make it much clearer what we are trying to target and focus on in terms of water, food, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, poverty and culture,"" he revealed.

""The GGA text also establishes an annual ministerial dialogue on the issue and calls for an annual report from developed countries on the delivery of the doubling of adaptation finance, people will be held accountable.""

The text also emphasises ""the importance of the collective well-being of all people, the protection of livelihoods and economies, and the conservation and regeneration of nature for present and future generations"".

Another hot potato for the COP28 president is the total phase-out of fossil fuels.

""The text includes an unprecedented reference to a transition away from ALL fossil fuels, enabling the world to reach net zero by 2050.

Remember this is significantly the first time fossil fuel language has been included at this level, previously it referred specifically to coal, but now we see a transition away from fossil fuels to reach net-zero by 2050,"" he revealed to the Nation.

Thirdly, the final text takes significant steps forward and steps towards the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

"" It encourages Parties to come forward with ambitious economy-wide emission reduction targets. Key here historically, NDCs to be across the economy with focus on developed countries, the only developing country that had economy word NDCs was Brazil, now they are encouraging it across all countries,"" the senior official said.

According to the COP28 Presidency during the briefing, this borders on the momentum of the financial architecture reform agenda, which for the first time recognises the role of critical rating agencies.

""This is important for Africa and calls for an increase in concessional and on-the-ground finance, because we have seen that finance has become a key focus for Africa on the ground, and we have seen significant commitments on loss and damage (L&D), for example, and this is really a fantastic development in terms of the latest text.""

The senior official goes on to reveal that the text also includes a new specific target to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency by 2030.

""Again, finance is key for Africa to be able to achieve this, but this is significant and progressive language that is in the text.

When we go to adaptation, we know it's significant for Africa that a key focus, here we see it goes beyond the doubling of adaptation finance as agreed at COP26 by recognising the need to significantly scale up finance beyond the doubling to meet urgent and evolving needs,"" he said.

On Tuesday, African experts had pointed out the gaps in an earlier second version of the text, which Ambassador Majid Al Suwaidi , COP28 Director General, said was only meant to be a talking point so they knew where parties' red lines were.

""The latest one is much weaker than the previous one. It doesn't set clear targets for adaptation, nor does it address the huge adaptation gap between what is needed and what is currently available (in the GCC). It simply repeats the commitment to double adaptation finance from COP26 in Glasgow.

As we've seen in the UN's Adaptation Gap report, doubling adaptation finance would still leave adaptation needs five to ten times greater than available finance. Setting such a low target before the long-term finance goal is decided next year would effectively marginalise adaptation,"" said Mohammed Adow, founder and director of Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think-tank that mobilises climate action in Africa and hopes to shift climate and energy policies to zero carbon.

""We need to break the deadlock on adaptation finance to clear the way for the decision the world expects and needs from this meeting to set a date for the phase-out of fossil fuels.""

‘The Long Way Home’ exhibition a must-see,"It was a billboard on Nairobi's Limuru Road just after the UN turnoff and before Village Market that told us that there was an exhibition of Chelenge’s art further down the road at the Rosslyn Riviera Mall.

Chelenge Van Rampelberg, to give her full name, is an old friend. She is not old, but the friendship is. So we went.

The exhibition is in the gallery of NCAI, the Nairobi Contemporary Art Institute. We were surprised by the scale of Chelenge’s work: the number and variety of her sculptures, woodcuts and paintings.

The sculptures, particularly, are beautiful – in their textures and their lines. And the stories they tell are intriguing, provocative and, sometimes, disturbing.

To hear more about their stories, we rang Chelenge and arranged to meet her at the gallery a few days later.

The exhibition is called, ‘The Long Way Home’. My first question, when we met, was, ‘Where is home?’ ‘It is here,’ she said. ‘It is now. I feel at home.’

To reach this feeling, she has gone a long way back: to the place where she grew up, and even to the Garden of Eden. It has been a long journey, and the coming has not been without personal and professional difficulties to surmount.

I challenged Chelenge when she said that she had had no training for her work. True, she has been to no formal school of art. But, according to what I have read, as a very young child, she joined her father in his weekend hobby of making traditional three-legged stools.

From him, she learnt how to use homemade chisels, saws, hammers and sharpened nails. But when her father said that she ought to have been born a boy, she was hurt.

Many of her sculptures are about what it means to be a woman. In ‘Black Beauty’, for example, she has carved as Okot p’Bitek wrote in ‘Song of Lawino’. Remember when Lawino sings the praises of the traditional dance:

‘It is danced in broad daylight,

In the open…

Her eyes sparkle like the fireflies,

Her breasts are ripe

Like the full moon.’

But Chelenge also has sculptures that show the pain of giving birth and the weight of children women carry after giving birth. ‘And I quarrel with God,’ she said.

She remembers the time she went to church as a child – how Christ on the cross was white and the men surrounding him with spears were black. She didn’t go to church again. A few of her sculptures are of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. ‘Why is it always Eve who is to blame for giving Adam the forbidden fruit?’

It was wonderful to hear her explain the therapeutic process of bringing her sculptures to life. She talked of the initial efforts of wielding the chisel – blow after blow. She talked about the finishing strokes of the sandpaper.

I asked if it was often difficult to finish a piece. ‘Always!’ she said. It sounded like a mother explaining how difficult it is to let her child go.

She talks with her sculptures as she is shaping them. She admitted it is often difficult to let them be sold. For this exhibition at the NCAI, most of the sculptures have been lent by individual owners, hotels and other places where they are displayed. A few have even been shipped back from Japan.

Chelenge told us that before the launch she was alone in the gallery with all her sculptures. I can imagine the kind of conversation she had with them.

The exhibition is on at the Rosslyn Riviera Mall till February 17. I hope that some of you will go. If you do, your journey will be much shorter than the journey home Chelenge will be telling you through her work.

Marital rape: Day women refused to suffer in silence,"In 2019, Roselyne Belinda Achieng’ walked out of her marriage after living with her husband for only four years. She was 22 years old.

This is not what the now 26-year-old envisioned when she met her husband a couple of years ago in church. The two later got married.

Ms Achieng’ had enrolled at Kenya Institute of Mass Communication for a Broadcast Journalism course in 2014, but dropped out for lack of funds.

All seemed rosy until one evening when she had just come home, having been discharged from hospital after delivering their second child.

A few hours in, her husband demanded that they get intimate, a request she turned down as she was still nursing some wounds and was also tired.

He would hear none of it. “I just felt him on top of me and had his way with me,” says Ms Achieng’.

On several occasions in the past, he had forced himself on her claiming it was his conjugal right.

Ms Achieng’ invited her husband’s brother to discuss the issue, but this did not help.

“On the following day, his brother said it was something they did to wives, and perfectly normal,” says Ms Achieng’ who adds, however, that as far as she was concerned, her husband raped her.

Nevertheless, she chose to stay; her children needed a present father while the last born was also only days old.

The violence did not, however, stop, and though she wished to share her ordeal with friends, she knew not how to start.

Her next option was to seek help from the church, because this was where it had all begun.

The spiritual leaders advises the couple to resolve their issue amicably. What pained Ms Achieng’, however, is that no one spoke about the fact that she had been raped severally by the person she trusted most.

She felt like the church was siding with the husband instead of solving the real issue.

One day, her husband turned violent and she screamed, attracting neighbours to her rescue.

Events of the day left her husband ashamed while the bond between them grew weaker with each passing day.

Eventually, she walked out of the marriage. Her last-born son was already a year old as she moved in with her parents in Manyatta, Kisumu County, trying to figure out her next move.

“One time, I came across women huddled in a group speaking about rape in their marriages. While I did not join in, I realised I was not alone. There were more silent sufferers in matrimonial homes,” says Ms Achieng’.

She adds: “That is why I later decided to speak up. There are women across the world who have gone through similar experiences but afraid to speak up.”

She then made it habit to share her story of abuse with other women in the slums hoping she could help them open up and share their struggle.

Together with a group of friends, Ms Achieng’ would counsel the women who approached them. The group gave birth to Slum Women Foundation, a non-government organisation championing women’s rights.

It focused on ending intimate partner violence among married couples by making women understand that intimacy also requires consent, married or not.

The forum created a safe space for women to open up and share their stories in order to heal, and create awareness that rape in marriages does exist.

The organisation founded in 2019, would also donate food, sanitary towels and face-masks to women and children during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Initially, she realised that some women were afraid to speak up, they would instead be given papers to anonymously write their concerns without writing their names. This would be followed by counselling, done in groups.

“Our efforts gave birth to the Kisumu Women Writers Association,” says Ms Achieng’.

Nakuru’s calligraphy king: 62-year-old Mike Okal still at it 37 years later,"Advancements in technology have significantly impacted on the art of calligraphy, with computer aided designs resulting in better quality artworks over the long period.

It is a job not many would prefer but 62-year-old Mike Obong’o Okal, also known as Balozi, has been a calligrapher in the streets of Nakuru city for over three decades, and is not about to down his tools any time soon.

Nestled in Nakuru city's Kanu street near Bondeni Post Office, Balozi's workshop is a vibrant space filled with quill pens, reeds, erasers, oil, canvas, papers, and various calligraphy instruments.

Balozi has been a calligrapher for 37 years, a skill he self-taught when there were no specialised courses available when he started the job.

His workshop reflects a treasure trove of artistic materials, offering a diverse range of artwork, including draughtsmanship, cartoons, portraits, and illustrations.

However, calligraphy remains his standout expertise.

The rarity of the art, which reveals a complex thought process, is what has kept him in the business for long, a superlative skill he has perfected over the years.

He writes deceptively, suggesting simplicity yet the work conveys punchy social commentary probing local issues such as politics, religious differences, history and other social issues.

What sets Balozi apart is not just his longevity in the field but the depth and complexity he infuses into his art.

His calligraphy conveys powerful social commentary on issues ranging from politics and religious differences to history and societal challenges.

Balozi's artistic journey has been solitary yet steady, with his hands crafting thousands of pieces that bear handwritten messages of hope, education, and advice.

His working area, nestled in a shared space, is a testament to his dedication to his craft.

Describing his process, Balozi explains, ""I start by buying manilla papers and cutting them into an A4 size. From there, I choose the information I would want to put down from my exercise book where I write all my creative thoughts.""

He meticulously crafts each piece, considering the reader's demographic and finishing with coloured pens to bring the message to life.

“My messages are inspired by what I see, hear and feel. I pick up a lot from conversations with people, the radio and generally what I see happening around society. From this I have generated thousands of messages in which many have in their homes in different parts of the country,” says Balozi as he stares at the bunch of copies he has placed on his laps.

His abstract paintings, although seemingly straightforward, delve into intricate subjects that demonstrate his mastery.

From his early days in Mombasa to his move to Nakuru in 1999, Balozi has witnessed the transformation of his art.

“Life was not easy with the menial jobs I was doing then. I said to myself that was something I could take up since I was good at handwriting and styling letters. In my village I would be paid by young boys to write beautiful love messages to the girls they were courting or those exchanging letters with their pen-pals,” he says.

""I used to be a very bright student, in fact, this is where I got the name Balozi. I represented my school in various academic competitions in which I topped. They ended up calling me ‘Ambassador of the school’ which translated in Kiswahili is Balozi,” he says as he reminisces about his primary school days in Kisumu.

He worked at a time when there were no coloured inks and only when brown paper sheets sold at the same time while learning about sketching, painting and getting dimensions right.

The era of photocopying, laminating paper and coloured pens and internet virality of content was unheard of back then.

Adapting to technological changes, he embraced laminating and framing when plastic bags were banned, and he now displays his vibrant copies in the streets of Nakuru for sale. Balozi's dream is to pass on his art to others, emphasising the need for passion and dedication.

He envisions teaching more people the art of calligraphy, especially those seeking alternative sources of income. His legacy is not just in the pieces he creates but in the potential for others to discover and flourish in the world of calligraphy.

Despite his humble beginnings, Balozi's art has provided for his family, educated his four children upto secondar school, giving him a sense of fulfillment.

Through his dedication and skill, Balozi has not only created a livelihood for himself but also paved the way for others to tap into the artistic richness of calligraphy.

Battling GBV in Nakuru: Fidelis Wambui’s inspiring story hope in face of challenges,"For five years, Fidelis Wambui Karanja has fought tooth and nail to end discrimination against women and gender-based violence (GBV).

Despite the many verbal insults and threats, Ms Karanja is not about to give up.

Talking to her as one of the heroes in the fight against GBV in Nakuru is like reading a story of hope and willpower.

Ms Karanja’s story is of hope and resilience. She has given girls and women in the slums of Free Area, Bondeni and Kaptembwa tips on protecting themselves from perpetrators of violence.

And it is not just the wretched of the Earth in the slums who are getting the services of Ms Karanja.

A big number of the women she helps are in the middle and upper-classes. Some are professionals who rarely talks about GBV in their homes.

“A majority of middle and upper-class women rarely talk about meted on them by spouses,” she says.

“Marriage is not supposed to be a death sentence. When you feel you’re not being treated like an equal shareholder in the union, the best thing is to seek freedom elsewhere,” she says.

Ms Karanja confidently talks about the highs and lows of her daily work, comparing it like a driver who is sure the vehicle’s tyres remain in contact with the road.

She says the driver must steer the vehicle properly and apply brakes properly, sure that the shock absorbers will work.

It is these “shock absorbers” that Ms Karanja says have kept her going, adding that they have optimally helped to keep women and girls safe.

“Being a shock absorber of women and girls in slums and posh areas who suffer daily violence means you absorb the impact of abuses, disagreements, pain, torture, tears and tension,” she says.

“My greatest joy is when I reduce the tension in the life of a girl or woman by showing her the right way to fight GBV at home, work place or any other place.”

Ms Karanja says she is always ready to absorb the negativity, stress and the anxiety that comes with her work to lessen it for victims of GBV in the cosmopolitan city and surrounding areas.

“I know my life is at times in danger because of the many threats but that will not stop me from advocating for a just society through ending GBV,” stated Ms Karanja who is the founder of Young African Women Initiatives (YAWI), an NGO.

She says her work has had a positive impact on society “as it makes many feel better and comfortable”.

“It is tough to place other people’s needs before yours. That can have an impact on one’s mental health and overall well-being. Because I feel like a shock absorber, the fight against the violence must be sustained,” she added.

Ms Karanja who her upbringing helped shape her perception towards life.

“Domestic violence was the order of the day where I grew up. Because of that, I swore to champion the rights of girls and women on becoming an adult. I am happy to be living my dream,” she says.

The journey has not been easy, she says.

“Some victims are compromised by their tormentors and corrupt administrators like chiefs to withdraw the cases,” Ms Karanja says.

“I can sometimes pursue a GBV case when about to reach the end for the abuser to be apprehended, the victim withdraws.”

And that is not all. Ms Karanja has had to deal with situations in which victims come to the defence of their abusers.

“One woman even told me her abuser was mentally ill and that she had taken the decision to forgive him,” she says.

“This was a nurse who almost died at the hands of her abuser. The man attempted to strangle her with a mosquito net. She was ready to withdraw the case against him despite living on borrowed time.”

Apart from the above challenges, Ms Karanja has had to face accusations of being a home and marriage-breaker.

“Some men blame me for being a homewrecker yet it is their girlfrirends or wives who report these cases to us,” Ms Karanja says.

“They do not choose to report to police but come to YAWI. They are comfortable opening up at YAWI instead of police since we cannot be compromised.”

A woman once sought refuge at YAWI offices when her husband threatened to throw her in a dam for refusing to reveal where she was getting help.

“These kinds of threats are mostly from wealthy husbands who fear being exposed in courts of law,” she says.

Some of the cases YAWI handleS are intriguing. Ms Karanja cites a woman she offered psycho-social support after her husband of 30 years.

“This man was not comfortable with the fact that his wife was not a virgin when they met. The violence against her may not have been physical but was emotional for he kept using unprintable words against her ,” says Ms Karanja.

“This clearly shows many sufferin women have not identified GBV red flags. Victims of GBV – both women and men – should walk out of such unions. They should not be bound by factors like property as that might translate to death.”

The progress Ms Karanja has made in ensuring the right of women and girls to live free from abuse has kept her going.

“I have never felt like I want to quit. I feel great when when people get justice,” she says.

“I will continue stepping on the accelerating pedal to help identify, prevent and remedy violence at home and in the workplace, with a strong focus on gender.”

Her work faces many hurdles, chief among them being delays in courts and police stations.

“Barriers to justice are concentrated in the corridors of justice. It is annoying to see an officer demanding a birth certificate to prove that a 13-year-old girl was raped by a 50-year-old man,” Ms Karanja says.

“Sexual misconduct, assault, child abuse and related crimes do not require a birth certificate for proof.”

Part 2: Turkana and Oil,"

In this second installment of Natural Justice, we delve deep into the frustrations of the Turkana community, a result of empty promises made by the government. Gabriel Ekwe, a voice featured in this episode and a community organizer in Turkana, describes the community's initial excitement shortly after the announcement of the discovery of oil in Turkana. However, this enthusiasm took a different turn when promised job opportunities came with low pay, and decisions were made without any community involvement whatsoever.

How could something so hopeful, so promising, turn so painful and cause so much despair?

Natural Justice is a narrative podcast that  follows individuals in communities forced to the frontline of climate change conflicts around the lake region as they push back using Kenyan courts to preserve their dignity and communal lands. They face huge challenges and are sandwiched between  big government, Chinese contractors and Western corporations.

"Philip Kinyinga M’Inoti: Behold the reverend, Njuri Ncheke elder and strict colonial chief!","The introduction, growth and development of the Methodist Church into the predominant religious institution it is today in the Meru counties on the slopes of Mt Kenya was the work of white missionaries with the stellar contributions of their pioneer African converts.

The history of this Christian denomination is also the story of one of the early converts, Philip Kinyinga M’Inoti.

In this book titled, A Saint to Behold with Rev Philip Kinyinga M’Inoti, co-authors Kiriki Mwithimbu and Kimathi Kinyinga, the latter being this great man’s son, have chronicled everything as it panned out from the very beginning in the early 20th Century.

Fondly known as Biribu, a corruption of his English name Philip, the man packed a lot in his nearly five-and-a-half decades of life that ended in a tragic road accident.

This biography of the Reverend M’Inoti is also a rich and well-told account of the history of the colonialisation of Kenya, and the Christian missionaries’ onslaught against cultural traditions. European colonisation wrecked traditional African societies and exploited economies.

The so-called “white man’s burden” was used to justify imperialism and consisted of the three Cs: Civilisation, Christianity and Commerce.

From early in his life, M’Inoti had showcased leadership qualities, emerging as a champion wrestler, getting converted to Christianity and escaping a church fire in 1914 set by Meru warriors opposed to the new religion, his work as a church minister, a traditional Njuri Ncheke elder and the Chief of Miiriga Mieru before his before his death in a road accident in 1952. He was one of the five survivors of the attack on a dormitory that had 11 youth.

One of his most pivotal contributions in the 1940-1950 decade was in promoting education. This saw the emergence of Kaaga Girls School, and Meru Teachers College, with the Rev Biribu effortlessly combining his roles as a religious leader and a colonial chief.

As the authors explain, he found himself as confidant on both sides of the divide – as a reverend and a Njuri Ncheke elder but executed both with dexterity.

In the foreword, Prof FX Gichuru, writes that the foundation of the Methodist Church in Meru is seen in this narrative. It helps one to understand the culture of the Amiiru, and their interactions with the missionaries and the effects of colonisation on the people.

M’Inoti was born in 1895. In about 40 years, until his death in 1952, he served as an evangelist and an ordained minister. He was also a councillor in the Local Government, a secretary of the Njurincheke Council of Elders, and finally, the Chief of Miiriga Mieru (1948 to 1952).

Upon his death, most of his well-preserved records and research materials were taken away. His church and colonial government associates picked the best. Indeed, this was the modus operandi of the colonialists and explains how Africa’s treasured sculptures and artifacts ended up in museums in Europe.

An ally of colonial administrators

Under pressure from Africans after independence in the 1960s, some were returned but many, including the skulls of some anti-colonial heroes such as Kenya’s Koitalel Samoei, are still hidden in European vaults or are on display in libraries and museums.

M’Inoti, the authors state, was an enigma, in fact, a Meru legend. He contributed immensely to preserving Amiiru culture, promoting literacy and religion and colonial rule. He became an ally of the colonial administrators, and adopted their ways, building a stone house and buying a car in the 1950s. He also wrote several books on Meru history and culture.

His unpublished manuscripts were carted away to the United Kingdom and United States. His Wuui wiji atia! a classic Kimiiru must-read of the 1950s and 1960s, was one of his major works.

A legacy of the Methodist Church and the Rev M’Inoti lives on in schools and hospitals. Kaaga, where the Methodist Mission was first established in 1912, is today the epicentre of learning and medical care. It has primary and secondary schools, the Main Campus of the Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) and Level Five Hospital at Maua.

The story of Kaaga Mission starts with colonial District Commissioner Edward Butler Horne, the man the Amiiru nicknamed Kangangi, meaning the wanderer, for his footloose style, allocated the land for the Methodist Church Mission in 1911. This is where Kaaga Boys Secondary School stands today.

In 1908, when DC Kangangi arrived, M’Inoti was only 13. He had undergone traditional rites and was already a stickler for cultural edicts, including that forbidding boys from entering their mothers’ houses. His father had passed away when he was barely five years old.

He would later play a major role in the translation of the Bible into Kimiiru. In 1941, he was bestowed with a certificate of recognition for championing the translation of the Bible by the British Foreign Bible Society.

Philip, who had a good command of English, also tested his Kiswahili knowledge by writing his first book, Asili ya WAmiiru na Desturi Zao. This very first book written by a Meru was published in 1931.

In 1931-32, he obtained a diploma in theology and on September 29, 1932, became the first Meru Methodist Church minister.

On May 4, 1939, he bought his first car, a Ford, for the then princely sum of 1,200 shillings. He had relied on his sturdy BSA motorbike that was best suited for the cattle-trail roads of the day.

On August 28, 1948, he was appointed the Chief of Miiriga Mieru. At 55, his next door neighbour was a Mzungu DO. He built a colonial style bungalow and children were driven to and from school and his homestead guarded by fierce Alsatians.

As the Senior Chief, his flagship education project was the upgrading of Kaaga Girls School. On 15th March, 1952, Chief Biribu Kinyinga perished in a road accident. He was 57. He had been fighting traditional beer (marwa), whose imbibing was regarded as a cultural norm, and the circumcision of girls.

He was, according to the authors, “tied to the Beberu (colonialist) like the proverbial tick to a cow” and fought against the Mau Mau and thus the struggle for independence.

This book accurately showcases M’Inoti’s service to God and humanity, and his solid contributions to building the Methodist Church, schools, colleges and hospitals in Meru.

Muthaura’s memoirs and images of Kibaki,"‘In the narrative books of the Bible, ‘Zion’ refers to a particular geographic region of Jerusalem — the section where King David built his residence. However, in later books of the Bible such as the prophets, ‘Zion’ shifts from a concrete referent to something more metonymic as it comes to refer to the entire city of Jerusalem.

The way, for example, ‘Hollywood’ might refer to an area of Los Angeles or, more abstractly, the movie industry generally. This is interesting to the rabbis… They note that ‘Zion’ might echo the word “zayon”, which refers to a dry and ruined place.

Therefore, the reasoning goes, ‘Zion’ becomes a shorthand for Jerusalem only in the later books of the Bible that emerge during exile. Only when the city is lost… only when its fields are salted and its people in bondage — only then is Jerusalem called ‘Zion.’… The city is ruined, the Temple is smashed, the people are scattered. In that absence, your longing may flourish into a new song, one that lives inside your heart. Call that place Zion — the place we love from afar. My lover is mine, and I am my lover’s, but only at a great distance,” so poignantly wrote Rebecca Sacks in her novel, The Lover, on the desire one has for a better country — one that is gone — whisked back into the past.

I thought of these words when Ambassador Dr Francis Muthaura launched his memoirs entitled, A Moving Horizon, on November 3. Serving in his time as Head of the Civil Service and Secretary to the Cabinet, he and the then-President Mwai Kibaki tried to build Kenya into a “Zion” but many Kenyans didn’t understand it at the time.

He writes that they were baffled by Kenyans, especially when the government lost the “banana vs orange” referendum of 2005. He writes that, “Since the banana campaign was led by 21 ministers plus the President and his Vice President and the orange side was led by only six ministers under the leadership of Raila Odinga, the banana campaign was optimistic that it would win because its leaders’ influence had a wider population cover than the six.

“The orange side had teamed up with the opposition Kanu to oppose the draft Constitution in the referendum. When the referendum was held on November 21, 2005, the government side lost by garnering 42 per cent against 58 per cent... What was even of greater concern was the political division within the country. It was ironical that while the economy was doing very well the political division in the country was getting wider. Indeed, the outcome split the country into two…”

While there are most likely many legitimate reasons why the referendum flopped, that part “while the economy was doing well” is a place every Kenyan would wish to return to (holding everything else constant). It’s like the Zion novelist Rebecca Sacks describes as a place we long for only when the city is ruined, the temple is smashed, and the people are scattered.

A Zion we didn’t see as a great homeland then because we complained a lot under Kibaki (maybe he wasn’t a great politician). Now, the bloom is off the rose, and we are having our own version of Armageddon — over-taxation and the high cost of living has hit us with the force of a thunderclap — we are a nation in a bruising rendezvous with destiny.

I doubt anyone can read the memoirs without thinking about Kibaki, whose presidency many now acknowledge to have been great, and some even romanticise. In retrospect, Kibaki’s presidency was like sweet musical notes that wash over sheets of silk, notes as soft as cashmere, floating melodies that carry the promise of good days — a world of lightness, ease, and great economic growth.

Any Head of State after Kibaki will always have a harder time because he presided over a vibrant economy — the envy of any President even though every leader faces a different set of challenges. Muthaura has done Kenyans and generations to come a favour by documenting his life journey from his childhood on the slopes of Mt Kenya to his retirement from public service. He has served Kenya in various positions from taking on diplomatic assignments in Europe and at the United Nations to returning to the Civil Service where he rose to the office of Head of the Civil Service and Secretary to the Cabinet.

He also covers the not-so-glossy parts of his life when he is indicted for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Since Ambassador Muthaura was Kibaki’s “Fixer”, the former President, even when not mentioned, still looms large as many Kenyans remember him and his government (at least looking back) with kindness. Maybe that happens to all presidents. Maybe not. Whatever. We look forward to better days. May the future be kind to us.

In Rebecca Sacks’ earlier-mentioned novel, a character in exile says forlornly, “This year we are slaves, next year may we be free in Jerusalem.” Most Kenyans, this year, are like slaves to tough economic times, next year may we be free in our own “Jerusalem”– the place we have always dreamt to be.

"Anti-black racism is rising in EU countries, led by Germany, study finds","Racism towards Black people is growing in Europe, with Germany, Austria and Finland showing the highest rates of discrimination and harassment, a survey of first- and second-generation Black immigrants in 13 EU countries published on Wednesday found.

The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which commissioned the survey and analyzed its findings in a report, said that in the space of six years since the previous study, the proportion of respondents who had felt racially discriminated against in the past 12 months had risen by 10 percentage points to 34%.

In Austria and Germany the proportion was 64% - almost twice the previous level of 33% in Germany and a significant increase from the 42% recorded in Austria six years earlier. The next worst was Finland with 54%.

""It is shocking to see no improvement since our last survey,"" FRA Director Michael O'Flaherty said. ""Instead, people of African descent face ever more discrimination just because of the colour of their skin.""

The proportion of respondents who reported feeling racially discriminated against over the past five years rather than 12 months rose to 45% across the 13 countries surveyed, an increase of six points from the previous study. The top three were the same, with Germany's rate the highest at 76%.

The poll carried out by Ipsos for the FRA was a sweeping survey of 16,124 immigrants and descendants of immigrants across 15 countries from which several FRA reports will be produced - on other ethnic minorities and Muslims. It was conducted between October 2021 and September 2022.

This report, entitled ""Being Black in the EU,"" is the first produced from that wider survey. It focuses on 6,752 people born in sub-Saharan Africa or with at least one parent born there living in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

The proportion of respondents who said they had suffered racist harassment in the past five years was unchanged from six years earlier at 30%. The highest national rate was 54% in Germany, followed by Finland and Austria.

Portugal and Sweden were the countries with the lowest rates of harassment and, along with Poland, they had the lowest racial discrimination rates, according to respondents.

The FRA report included a series of recommendations for EU member states such as properly enforcing anti-discrimination legislation and considering a motivation based on racial bias as an aggravating circumstance when setting penalties for crimes.

 ,"The National Assembly Finance and National Planning Committee has approved the publication of a Bill that seeks to protect borrowers and loan guarantors through the establishment of the Ombudsman and the Financial Sector Tribunal to oversight lenders.

The Financial Markets Conduct Bill, 2023 provides for full disclosure of information by a lender to a potential borrower and the guarantor before giving the loan.

The Bill provides that a pre-contract statement and quotation be provided with details of the loan advanced such as the dates and number of instalments, the total amount to be repaid including the principal, interest, loan fees and charges.

“The legislative proposal will limit lenders from charging or recovering from the borrower or guarantor’s interest exceeding the maximum rates as prescribed by the Financial Markets Conduct Authority.”

The Bill provides for the establishment of the Financial Sector Ombudsman to handle complaints and the Financial Services Tribunal to arbitrate disputes in the financial services sector.

The Bill further provides that lenders shall not vary the interest rates charged during the term of the contract. The lender will be required to determine the likelihood that the borrower and the guarantor will be able to comply with the financial obligations under the contract without substantial hardship, and should the lender decline the loan, they will be under obligation to give a specific reason.

The Bill also requires that retail financial customers may claim compensation from the Conduct Compensation Fund in case of loss or damages caused by a financial product/service provider.

The proposed Bill provides for restriction of lenders from providing credit reports that contain information about the customer, as well as recommendations about the credit worthiness of the customer, based on prohibited information.

“The legislative proposal seeks to promote a fair, non-discriminatory financial market, conducive for credit access by establishing uniform practices and standards for providers of financial services, regulating the cost of credit, and establishing the Financial Markets Conduct Authority whose functions shall be to regulate and supervise the conduct of providers in providing financial products and services to retail financial customers,” the Bill states.

It establishes the Financial Markets Conduct Authority Board of Directors consisting of a non-executive chairperson appointed by the President, the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary, the Central Bank of Kenya governor, five other persons with relevant experience appointed by the Treasury Cabinet Secretary, and the CEO, who shall be an ex-officio member with no right to vote.

The Bill also provides for financial conduct licences, which will limit the provision of financial products and services as service providers cannot operate without them.

“For instance, a person who does not hold a financial conduct license cannot advertise for the provision of credit services,” a brief on the Bill prepared by the House legal team states.

“The [Bill] proposes that, where an entity already holds a license under a sectoral law – such as the Capital Markets Act, the Banking Act or Microfinance Act – which covers the provision of financial products, that entity will be considered to have satisfied the requirements of the Bill. This is subject to a period of exemption of twenty-four months from when the Bill comes into force. Such entities need not obtain a licence.”

 ,"The official exchange rate of the shilling against the dollar on Monday crossed the 150-unit mark following a period of sustained and consistent depreciation that has narrowed the gap between the official and retail selling rates of the US currency.

Since the beginning of the year, the shilling has depreciated by 17.7 per cent against the dollar, which is more than double the 8.3 per cent it shed against the unit in the whole of 2022.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) indicative rate published on Monday morning showed the dollar’s buy price at Sh149.84 and a selling rate of Sh150.04 units, hence an average of 149.94.

The spot or average trading rate had climbed to Sh150.03 in the afternoon.

The indicative rate is the closing price of the previous day’s trading session, which is taken as the opening price of the following day.

A check in banking halls of 12 commercial lenders — including all nine tier one banks — showed that they were selling the dollar at between Sh154.95 and Sh157, and buying at a range of Sh141 and Sh149.95.

Read: Kenya shilling tipped to weaken further on low forex inflows

Forex bureaus, meanwhile, quoted dollar selling prices of between Sh156.50 and Sh157 while buying at between Sh152 and Sh153.

Banks have been selling dollars above the Sh150 level from late August. A forex dealer told the ‘Nation’ that the lenders are seeing resistance on the sell side at around Sh156, signalling the currency might be finding its true rate after months of consistent depreciation.

The reopening of the interbank dollar market from April and removal of a Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) rule that capped daily deviation from the indicative rate at 20 cents has helped the exchange rate find its own level through demand and supply.

“The interbank market is better than where we were in March, even though there are still a few structural issues to sort out. Overall, we have seen the spread between retail and official selling price of the dollar come down to between Sh4 and Sh6, from double digits in the first quarter,” said a dealer.

During the period, the interbank market was not functioning, banks quoted the rate at which they were buying the dollar in line with that of the CBK rate to avoid regulatory reprimand, but on the sell side they were charging each other — and customers— a margin of up to Sh13 above the official rate.

Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u, when appearing before the National Assembly on September 27, said the shilling’s recent slide was not a free fall, but rather a “process of adjustment” from what he termed as historical policy mistakes in management of the shilling.

Prof Ndung’u said Kenya had largely held its currency constant in the previous five to seven years even as the country’s price structure changed, leaving it misaligned with the real economy.

“We are actually paying the price of misalignment which happened in the previous five to seven years,” said the CS when he appeared before Parliament to answer questions from MPs.

“As soon as we allowed the nominal exchange rate to move — because there was a requirement that it can’t fluctuate more than 20 cents either way — then we restarted the interbank market, there was [a] steep depreciation which was also being pushed by scarcity of dollars.”

In comparison to other regional currencies, the shilling loss against the dollar this year stands out.

The Uganda shilling, for instance, has depreciated by 0.96 per cent to the greenback since January, while the Tanzania unit has shed 6.8 per cent while the Rwandan franc has appreciated by 14 per cent to the US currency since the turn of the year.

This year, the Uganda shilling has gained 20.2 per cent to exchange at 25.04 units versus the Kenyan unit while the Tanzania shilling gained by 13.4 per cent to 16.67 units as the Rwandan franc rose 6.1 per cent to 8.15 units.

The weaker shilling against the dollar has meant costlier purchases for importers and merchant traders while the external debt load has grown on a local currency perspective. Exporters have, on the other hand, enjoyed exchange gains when they are paid in the US currency.

World Bank warns automation of KRA systems may limit tax compliance,"The ongoing rapid automation of Kenya Revenue Authority(KRA) systems risks hurting compliance by individuals and businesses by locking out large groups of disadvantaged people such as the visually impaired, those without smartphones, internet connectivity, and limited technological know-how.

The taxman has recently gone big on automated systems including the filing of tax returns and real-time monitoring of sales transactions through electronic invoicing in a bid to maximise revenue collections.

The World Bank, however, cautioned that the shift to automated systems risked secluding sizeable groups of taxpayers with negative consequences on compliance.

“Automation of tax measures will potentially lock out segments of the public including VMGs (vulnerable and marginalised groups) and other disadvantaged groups, due to digital illiteracy, lack of smartphones, poor electricity, and internet connectivity.

This will likely lead to non-compliance by individuals and businesses” the multilateral lender said in a note on its backed programme for strengthening governance for enabling service delivery and public investment in Kenya.

Low access to smartphones remains a concern in Kenya even as the government migrated more services to digital. For example, the Central Bank of Kenya put proposals for a digital shilling on the back burner mainly due to low access to smartphones which risked locking out many.

The latest data by the Communications Authority of Kenya for the quarter to June shows that the country has about 30.8 million smartphones—a contrast to the country's overall population of about 50.6 million. It is also important to note that some individuals hold multiple smartphones.

The World Bank urged KRA to enhance tax education and ensure its tax systems accommodated all populations.

“Decentralise stakeholder engagement, and sensitise the public on the tax administration measures, including VMGs and other disadvantaged groups, and implement targeted measures to access those with disability, literacy, and mobility challenges” it recommended.

“Simplify tax education to be understood by all segments of the public and ensure tax systems accommodate all populations such as those with no or limited digital know-how, lack smart-phones, those residing in areas with poor electricity and internet connectivity” it added.

KRA’s new digital system requires trading companies to send real-time data on their daily sales via internet-enabled electronic tax registers

A review of the KRA online and virtual sales control unit shows that traders are required to give detailed information including their business name, physical addresses, and personal identification numbers(PINs) as well as those of the corresponding buyers, the item description, unit price, quantity, total price, and tax designation before any sales transactions would be approved.

The issuance of a buyer’s PIN is however optional on KRA Online & Virtual Sales Control Unit (OSCU & VSCU) -- is a software module that links the Trader Invoicing System(TIS) to KRA for processing of sales receipts.

The KRA system further demands that sales invoices detail the discount percentage offered, the total price of an item with a discount as well as the negative value of the total discounts given as part of a strategy to seal leaks.

A sales invoice will also display the total amount computed before the discount, the total tax-exempted amount, the total amount without tax, the total amount of tax to be paid and the total price to be paid. Further, the invoice will contain the payment method, and the number of items sold and contain a tabular presentation of the various tax components including goods exempted from value-added-tax(VAT), those charged 16 percent VAT, zero-rated goods, non-vatable goods and those charged eight percent VAT.

The invoices will also list the date and time of the transaction, the serial number of the OSCU/VSCU equipment, and a unique signature receipt.

Kiprugut Chumo’s family welcomes move to rename Kericho Stadium,"The family of legendary athlete Kiprugut Chumo has welcomed the decision to rename the yet-to-be-completed Kericho Green Stadium in honour of the runner who won the first medal for Kenya at the Olympics.

While presiding over Mashujaa Day celebrations at the stadium on Friday,  President William Ruto said the 10,000-seater facility will be renamed Wilson Kiprugut Chumo Stadium in honour of the legendary runner.

Read: Ruto renames Kericho Green Stadium after legendary Kiprugut Chumo

The move was greeted by jubilation by over 10,000 people who attended the Mashujaa Day celebrations at the stadium which was upgraded in a record 45 days.

Close family members of the trailblazing athlete who passed away on November 12, last year at the age of 84 after developing breathing complications at his home at Kipchebor village in Ainamoi constituency, welcomed the announcement.

“Allow me to celebrate Kiprugut Chumo, the first Kenyan to win an Olympic medal by renaming the Kericho Green Stadium after him,” President Ruto said at the tail end of his speech during the Mashujaa Day celebrations held at the stadium.

“We are grateful for the recognition of our father who is a hero in sports locally and globally, by the president who has directed that the stadium be renamed in his honour, a year after he passed away,” Gideon Kipng’eno, who is one of  Kiprugut’s sons, said.

Some family members at the stadium were surprised when the announcement was made as they had no prior knowledge of the plans, even though they had been invited to the function as guests.

“The fact that the recognition comes a few weeks before the first anniversary of his (Kiprugut’s) death is a blessing to the family, the sports fraternity and the country,” Sarah Langat, who is one of Kiprugut’s daughter, said.

Kipngeno and Sarah both said the family members were taken by surprise by Ruto’s pronouncement, just like all others who attended Mashujaa Day celebrations. Kiprugut lost his wife Ruth on October 20, 2020 after which his health started deteriorating. He passed on at Siloam Hospital in Kericho where he had been  rushed for treatment.

He became the first Kenyan to win a medal at the Olympic Games where he  claimed bronze medal in the 800 metres race (then known as 880 yards) at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

In the 1968 Summer Olympics, he claimed silver medal in the 800m after clocking 1:44.57, coming second to Australian Ralph Doubell.

Work on Kericho Green Stadium to continue after celebrations,"The upgraded Kericho Green Stadium has been handed over to the government and will host the Mashujaa Day celebrations.

Nation Sport understands that the facility, which will host various athletics and ball competitions, has been upgraded by the national government at a cost of Sh400 million and has a seating capacity of 10,000 people.

However, the construction work is not complete. The upgrade expected to continue after Friday’s Mashujaa Day celebrations that will be presided over by President William Ruto, and Angolan president Angola President Joao Lourenco who will be the chief guest.

Cabinet Secretary for Youth and Sports Ababu Namwamba said the government was committed to upgrading sports facilities in the country so as to nurture talent among youth.

“The stadium has a seating capacity of 10,000, and the VIP Pavilion holds 2,000 guests. It has changing rooms, offices, VIP lounge and other facilities that have been constructed from scratch,” Namwamba said Thursday during the handover ceremony by the contractor Modern Precast Kenya Limited in the company of Kericho Governor Erick Mutai, and Sports Principal Secretary Peter Tum.

In the 45-day upgrade, the number of gates at the facility was increased to three from two, while all the pavilions were brought down and seven new ones constructed.

“We have turned a dilapidated, forgotten and ignored ground into a facility that befits a stadium.We have done the upgrade in memory of the athletes. All league matches will be held at the stadium,” Namwamba said.

“This facility was called Kericho Green Stadium but in reality, there was no stadium in place. We now have one.It is now in the hands of Sports Kenya which will allow Kericho County government to use it.”

Namwamba said the athletics track which was removed during the upgrade will be replaced in the coming weeks.

“A tartan track will be laid inside the stadium, after the one that was installed in 2019 was plucked out to pave the way for the ongoing upgrade of the facility,” Namwamba said during the handover ceremony.

The county government laid the artificial track inside the facility in 2019 under the leadership of former Governor Paul Chepkwony but was in tatters when it was removed two months ago as athletes risked injury during competitions and training.

Kericho County Government had spent Sh110 million in upgrading the stadium, and Sh35 million in laying the artificial track, which was the most prominent feature at the stadium at the time.

“The stadium is now available for use by the immense pool of talent in athletics in the region in honour of legendary athletes from the region, led by Kiprugut Chumo, who won Kenya’s first medal at the Olympics (in 1964 in Japan) and opened the floodgates for Kenyan medalists at the Olympics,” Namwamba said.

“Kiprugut passed away last year at the age of 84, leaving behind a formidable heritage for Kenya as the home of sports men and women.”

Namwamba said the national government was working with the 47 counties to upgrade stadiums so as to promote talent among youth so as to make sports an industry.

“Within one year, with the handover of Kericho Green Stadium, we are celebrating our second regional stadium after Moi Stadium - Embu which was delivered in five weeks. There has been talk of white elephant stadiums, but that was under a different administration. Dr (William) Ruto’s administration will not have white elephant projects,” Namwamba stated.

The government is rolling out the renovation programme under a sports infrastructure master plan that also involves the upgrade of Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, and Nyayo National Stadium. It also involves the proposed construction of Talanta Stadium to international standards.

Namwamba said each of the 47 counties will benefit from the upgrade of sports facilities, while community grounds will be transformed into local facilities for scouting and improving talent.

In collaboration with Kakamega County Government, the national government is upgrading Bukhungu Stadium to international standards.

“We are in discussion with Kisumu County Government over the upgrade of Jommo Kenyatta grounds, and Moi Stadium. The same applies to Marsabit Stadium (Marsabit County), Olkalau Stadium in Nyandarua, and Bomet IAAF Stadium in Bomet County,” he said.

“The government will elevate sports into an industry and that is why the counties are competing to host 2027 Afcon matches when 11 months ago, we did not have football to talk about. The government worked with speed to have the Fifa suspension on Kenya lifted and football is truly back in full swing,” Namwamba said.

Renovation work outside the playground is not complete. The contractor did not finish work on the perimeter wall, parking area, public toilets and other facilities due to tight constraints.

“Work is till going on at the stadium. We have brought forward the handover ceremony because of Mashujaa Day celebrations. It is still a construction site with the upgrade proceeding after the celebrations,” Namwamba said.

Kapkatet Stadium is in the list of priority regional facilities that will be upgraded on merit as it is an historic ground with good location and is a hotbed of athletics talent, Namwamba said.

Governor Mutai said the government had shown it has the ability to deliver projects within deadline, including those considered white elephants.

“With the two months that this project has been delivered, is a clear manifestation that the government should not be having incomplete projects. All the projects can be completed in record time,” Governor Mutai said.

"Government to build brand new stadium as Nyayo, Kasarani set for spectacular facelift","The government will put up a multi-million football-rugby only 50,000-seater, Talanta Stadium, at the Jamhuri Sports Complex, Nairobi, Sports CS Ababu Namwamba has announced.

In what could be Kenya Kwanza government's first major sporting infrastructural undertaking costing billions, the Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani, Nyayo National Stadium and Kipchoge Keino Stadium will also undergo major refurbishment, giving the historic arenas a completely new look.

The new Talanta Stadium and the renovations of three stadiums are part of the country's plans to host the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations.

Kenya is bidding to co-host the championship with Uganda, and Tanzania while there are individual bids from Algeria, Botswana and Egypt.

Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and the Arts, Ababu Namwamba said Tuesday that the ministry of defence will be the lead supervisor of the projects for “precision in execution and delivery” while his ministry will provide funds.

Namwamba, who was accompanied by Sports Principal Secretary Peter Tum, handed over the four projects to Defence Principal Secretary Patrick Mariru on behalf of the Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale at the Jamhuri Sports Complex.

Namwamba, who declined to disclose how much the projects will cost his ministry, offered that there was enough money to complete all the four projects.

Mariru promised to deliver the projects on time. He said work will start immediately with the closure of the arenas next week. “It shall be done and our work is to go backwards so as to finish before time,” said Mariru.

The Talanta Stadium project that will have several training fields for football, rugby, hockey, tennis among others, will be completed in two years.

Namwamba said the design of the Talanta Stadium that has three levels draws its concept from the shield and two spears that are Kenya’s national emblem.

“Talanta Stadium will only host football, rugby and concerts and not athletics,” said Namwamba.

However, Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret will have an increased capacity of 15,000.

All the designs of the four stadia that put into consideration the green renewable energy were done by the University of Nairobi's Enterprises and Services Limited with Professor Erastus Abonyo as the lead consultant.

If successful, it will be the first time the country is putting up a new international public stadium since the construction of the 60-seater MISC 36 years ago and the Nyayo National Stadium 40 years ago.

Speaking during the live NTV 7pm Swahii news “Hatma Ya Michezo Nchini” hosted by Frederick Muitiriri on Monday, Namwamba said he was confident that the joint Afcon bid will win

“We have brought in the ministry of defence because it has been tried and tested,” said Namwamba, adding that they will focus on three things -- speed, cost efficiency and standards.

The entire Nyayo National Stadium will have a modern canopy with energy saving lighting system while the main operation centre will target the pitch that will be overhauled with a new drainage system put in place.

The stadium will also get a new tartan running track that meets the World Athletics standards.

The media centre at the Nyayo National Stadium will be redone with the VIP area capacity increased to international standards.

The changing rooms for athletes will be remodelled to state-of-art besides the public toilets though the training venue for the Nyayo National Stadium will be at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

“The renovations at the Nyayo National Stadium will be extended to the gymnasium and the swimming pool areas,” said Namwamba. “These are category four for renovations based on Fifa’s 2022 standards.”

Besides getting a full canopy with green renewable energy lighting system, the MISC will also get two training pitches with modern running tracks. The current pitch, running track, changing rooms and public ablution will be overhauled.

“Kasarani will have a World Athletics-approved running track since our intention is to bid for the 2030 World Championships,” said Namwamba.

Kipchoge Keino Stadium, which is a category three facility like Nyayo, will have a full canopy with modern lighting system, a modern playing and training pitch that will have underground drainage system.

Abonyo said they have designed all the arenas for easy access for everyone, both able bodied and physically challenged. ""These masterpieces will be a marvel when completed,"" said Abonyo.

"Kenya’s food, beverage sector records 5pc growth","The Kenyan food and beverage industry continues to grow with the sector recording an annual growth of five per cent driven by growing incomes, rising urbanisation, and increased consumer spending.

At least 2,500 stakeholders drawn from East Africa met in Nairobi for the annual Kenya Food Event, an event that saw 60 companies showcase their products.

The three-day event, held at Sarit Centre between September 5 and 7, 2023, attracted exhibitors across food and beverage, hospitality, manufacturing, producers, and processors.

Among the standout exhibitors at this year's event was Go Pro Foods, with its leading brand, BHEEMS.

Go Pro Foods Managing Director Raj Ram said Kenya alone boasts approximately 1,200 food and beverage manufacturers, ranging from small-scale enterprises to multinational corporations.

This makes, he said, the country a premier destination for businesses seeking to explore new opportunities, connect with industry leaders, and discover the latest products.

He said there is immense interest from international buyers and distributors looking for Kenyan products with Nairobi leading the charge with the highest consumer food and beverage spending power, further highlighting the region's potential.

“The Food Expo has not only allowed us to expose our products and brand to local distributors and international buyers, but also allowed us to meet fellow exhibitors, and learn about their experiences, the products they offer, and discuss the possibility of collaborating or partnering on business opportunities,” said Mr Ram.

He said that at Go Pro Foods, they are driven by a mission to transform and enrich the lives of people and communities across Africa, riding on the adage of “farm-to-table” to ensure that it provides nutritious food to its customers at an accessible price.

“Enrichment of life must start from your health. We look forward to getting involved in local sustainable projects surrounding farming, water, cooking, education, and health,” he said.

The MD said at BHEEMS, they put a strong emphasis on quality and safety in its food products with their facility comprising second-generation plants.

Consequently, their products are in major modern trade networks and they are looking forward to future collaborations as well as extending their distribution network in the general trade.

“We process our products twice to ensure maximum impurities are removed. Furthermore, we have an in-house quality assurance manager to ensure all products are tested rigorously upon entry into the premises, throughout processing, and batch tested following packaging ready for dispatch,” he said.

Teaser: Natural Justice,"

Kenya is one of the Lake region countries that is vulnerable to climate change. A slight weather change pattern means communities are faced with drought and flooding. On the other hand, the coastal towns face the risk of a climate change-induced sea level rise that threatens to submerge islands in a few decades.

Kenya is among the first African states to establish progressive climate legislation but the country also continues to support investments in extractive industries in support of development, the effect is that these industries are destroying local communities’ livelihoods and keeping the country in an unsustainable path.

A conflict between the government's policies on development and Kenya’s constitution’s commitment to fighting effects of climate change finds an arena in many rural communities that are now invited to make hard choices for themselves and future generations.

In this narrative podcast series, Natural Justice, we follow individuals in communities forced to the frontline of this conflict as they push back using Kenyan courts to preserve their dignity and communal lands.

CDSC boss Nkoregamba Mwebesa resigns,"Nkoregamba Mwebesa has resigned from the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC), 3 years and 5 months after taking up the job.

CDSC General Manager for Business Support Services and Chief Finance Officer, Jesse Kagoma, has now been appointed to take over the leadership of the entity effective September 1.

Mr Mwebesa will be remembered notably for the launch of the Securities and Lending Borrowing programme in February 2022, a programme designed to unlock activity in Kenya’s capital markets through allowing investors holding stocks for the long-term to lend to those keen on short-term gains. The product has, however, struggled to register traction thus far.

Mr Mwebesa previously served as the CEO of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) during its boom years between 2005 and 2008.

“The Board of Directors of the Central Depository & Settlement Corporation Limited announces the resignation of Nkoregamba Mwebesa as Chief Executive of the Corporation. Mr Nkoregamba has been at the helm of the Company since February 2020 and has steadily steered CDSC through the persistent business headwinds during and after the Covid-19 pandemic,” a CDSC statement says.

“Mr Mwebesa exits to pursue other career interests. The Board appreciates his invaluable input and leadership and wishes him all the best in all his future pursuits.”

CDSC is a limited liability company which provides automated clearing, delivery and settlement facilities in respect of transactions carried out at NSE as well as holding of listed and non-listed securities, including other documents of title on behalf of investors.

Learning lessons from Covid will protect Africa and the world from future pandemics,"The 194 member states of the World Health Organization are currently negotiating the first pandemic accord. Acknowledging that the world learned many hard lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic, governments have agreed that effective mechanisms must be put in place to prevent, prepare, and better respond to the next global health threat.

The African region has been repeatedly subjected to the devastation associated with pandemics, natural disasters, and conflict. It is clear that we need to invest in responsive and resilient health systems, accompanied by strong community engagement. Strengthened health systems, societies, along with new tools and mechanisms will be invaluable in the development of the pandemic accord.

Africa has recently been exposed to multiple outbreaks of Ebola, cholera, and COVID-19, some occurring simultaneously. Despite our resource constraints, we have a wealth of experience with responding to multiple outbreaks. We have, however, been the last continent to receive supplies, despite being the one with the greatest needs. And the region continues to grapple with non-communicable diseases, and the ongoing challenges of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in the midst of Covid 19.

Nations now negotiating the accord include every country on the African continent. Further, the International Health Regulations (IHR), an overarching legal framework that defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies with the potential to cross borders, are also being amended in the wake of the pandemic. What do these developments mean?

First, it is not only the African region that needs the accord and stronger IHR. The whole world needs it, particularly to prevent outbreaks from becoming pandemics through rapid and effective collective response. But even that is not enough. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the world witnessed the best and worst of humanity. On the one hand, the development of vaccines and sharing of knowledge by scientists across the world were unprecedented. On the other hand, there was a lack of equitable access to these scientific endeavours, with countries being ostracised for sharing information.

The inequities of the distribution of Covid vaccines were more acute for many countries in the Global South, which had limited supplies and no capacity to produce vaccine to meet their needs, forcing them to the back of the queue. The sharing of pandemic pathogens and genetic sequencing contributes to risk assessment as well as prompt introduction of containment measures and R&D for new products. Such sharing should not lead to punitive measures nor be a disincentive for those who willingly provide such information.

A pandemic accord would enhance collaboration, improve the unity of the world’s response, address the equity with which that response is carried out, and increase the speed and efficacy of preparedness and response measures.

In addition to five negotiating sessions on the pandemic accord that were held by all Member States of WHO, with a sixth to be held in July, the African region has convened region-specific consultations and sessions devoted to specific topics such as equity. Three sessions on proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations have also been held with a fourth to be held in July.

The accord represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect the world from a future pandemic. It is vital that we heed the lessons of Covid-19 to make quantum improvements in the way the world prevents, prepares for, and responds to infectious disease threats.

These 194 sovereign governments—and they alone—can decide what should be included in the accord and how the International Health Regulations are amended. The accord and the amendments will be presented to the World Health Assembly in May 24.

Please join us in supporting your government to help determine the best possible measures to protect us all from the next pandemic. Everyone, from children to parents to health workers, all stand to benefit.

The H. pylori menace causing antibiotic resistance,"Last week, a member of the family fell sick and was taken to the hospital. She was complaining of nausea, vomiting, headache, fever and neck muscle discomfort. The doctor at the emergency department conducted a few tests, including a full blood count and a stool test for the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antigen test, which was found to be positive. She was sent home with a sack of medication to treat the H. pylori infection.

Two days later, her condition had worsened, with dehydration and weakness. A repeat consultation with malaria testing led to a positive malaria test and appropriate treatment for the same. Thankfully she is on the way to recovery.

In the same week, a patient of mine called for a second opinion. I have not seen her for some time. Last week, she visited an outpatient facility feeling nauseous, with general fatigue and body weakness. She was subjected to a battery of tests, including the H.pylori test. Despite requesting for a pregnancy test, it wasn’t conducted. With a positive H. pylori antigen test, she was sent home with her own little package of medications.

She gave up on the medication on the fifth day due to the side effects and proceeded to grab a commercial pregnancy test kit off the counter at her local pharmacy. The test was positive, prompting the call. She was worried about the effect of the medication on her developing baby. Her symptoms were simply a result of her first-trimester pregnancy.

Meanwhile, a friend called for a referral to a paediatric gastroenterologist. She complained that her daughter, who is barely six, is on her third course of H. pylori treatment in a year. She was fed up! She wanted to seek a second opinion because she was not convinced this is what her daughter needed.

All these calls came through in a span of less than three days. When the pharmaceutical industry cried foul over the misuse of H. pylori testing and treatment, many doctors shunned them and assumed they did not want to pay for the cost of care. However, it is becoming clear that, for a number of doctors and clinical officers in the emergency and outpatient departments, especially in the major towns, when there is no other explanation for the patient’s symptoms, then H. pylori infection becomes the fallback diagnosis.

What is disheartening is that most of these patients are not seen continuously by the same doctors or clinicians, hence they fail to note how these treatments are not even helping relieve the symptoms they were trying to alleviate.

The treatment for H. pylori is extremely expensive, ranging from an average of Sh6,000 to Sh14,000 for a course of medication. Throw in the consultation fees and the tests and a single visit will cost anything from Sh15,000 to 25,000.

To put this into context, evidence points to at least one in two persons walking around, harbouring this notorious bacterium in their stomach. It is fascinating to hear patients referring to the bacteria instead of the condition it supposedly causes. I have never heard of a patient reporting to be carrying Plasmodium falciparum infection. They simply state that they have malaria! So, what is different in this case?

H. pylori is a unique bacterium that has the ability to survive in the stomach, in a hostile environment where most bacteria are almost instantly pulverised by the high acid levels within the stomach. It is transmitted through the faeco-oral route, meaning one literally swallowed it in food or drink, contaminated by stool from a person infected by H. pylori. Children tend to get infected from age three to around five for the first time. The infection is more common among children than adults. One can get re-infected throughout life, even after treatment.

To this end then, what are the treatment guidelines? For children, test for H. pylori, only if the child demonstrates obvious symptoms. These include children confirmed to have peptic ulcers, children with a family history of gastric (stomach) cancer, and children with a special type of cancer called Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (MALToma). Minor symptoms of dyspepsia do not warrant testing for H. pylori.

For adults, the same guidelines apply, and in addition, patients <60 years, who have dyspepsia without a proper diagnosis of the cause, patients who require to be put on long-term treatment by a specific group of drugs called NSAIDS, and patients who have unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia.

The biggest fright with regard to the presence of H. pylori is that it remains a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer and MALTomas, hence the reason for patients with this risk profile being subjected to testing and treatment. It is important to realise that a risk factor is not a cause of cancer. Several other factors come into play, to determine whether a person ultimately gets cancer or not. An important caution with regard to the treatment of H. pylori is that this bacterium is responsive to a small range of antibiotics to eradicate it. The treatment is usually a combination of at least two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI - a drug that disables the stomach’s acid-making capacity, reducing acid and allowing the lining of the stomach to heal faster); the infamous triple therapy kit.

More importantly is that within this range of antibiotics, H. pylori has a very high rate of developing resistance. Unfortunately, most of these medications are also rather unpalatable, compromising the patient’s ability to comply with the treatment regimen. Many patients give up after sustained nausea, vomiting, metallic taste and itching.

The repeated incomplete treatments we are seeing across board are resulting in increased antimicrobial resistance; yet the patients being treated do not require the treatment in the first place! We need to put a stop to this menace! Antimicrobial resistance is our currently developing pandemic. We can avert this course if we put our foot down and say no to unnecessary triple therapy kits!

"Hadzabe, the Tanzanian tribe where women call the shots","Tap! Tap! Tap! A brown antelope calf hops across a smooth graded Karatu-Mang'ola road in Oldeani, a cool area in northern Tanzania covered in maize, sunflower, beans and coffee plantations.

Past Oldeani, it gets hot and windy. It's dusty too. As we get closer, we notice bushes, shrubs and indigenous trees scattered all over.  We are headed to meet the Hadzabe in the depths of forests of Yaeda Valley near Lake Eyasi in the Arusha region.

This hunter-gatherer community has also settled in Serengeti Plateau, on the side of Meatu District in the Simiyu region. The plateau borders Kenya. Others are spread across the forests of Mbulu and Kiteto districts in the Manyara region.

A section of Sonai settlement on June 2, 2023.

The Hadzabe are among about 130 ethnic groups in Tanzania. They are known by different variations—Hadzabi, Hadzane, Hadzape, Hadzapi, Hatsa and Watindiga. In the Kilimanjaro region, for instance, they are known as Watindiga. In Mtwara, they call them Wazabi.

Though Tanzania’s 2022 Census has not provided their population estimates, the United Nations says their numbers range from 1,300 to 1,500, a handful of the 61.7 million Tanzanians.

Endeko Endeko, a member of this community, is helping us locate his people who have settled in the Melekaa area.

There are no roads or signage here to give a sense of direction.

Slight change

Some progress though, the Hadzabe now own mobile phones, which they buy with the money visitors donate to them, or from their beadwork proceeds. The phone signal is, however, poor here.

A display of ornaments the Hadzabe sell to visitors at Sonai settlement, on June 2, 2023.

We access Melekaa from Mang’ola trading centre, a remote business area with only one hotel and a few shops. After diverting onto a bumpy road described as “hiyo barabara ya kwenda kwa wa Hadzabe (that road leading to the Hadzabe),” we manoeuvre through the rocks and shrubs.

We finally arrive at the foot of a huge baobab tree with a cave on its trunk. Before it, is a dusty open field surrounded by more baobabs and shrubs. On the right is a hillock of intimidating boulders resting on each other, forming a somewhat fortification for the community.

Shortly, a man in shorts and a brown sleeveless shirt walks down. Over his shoulder is a beaded skin. His foot is covered with grey tyre sandals and a knife is strapped to his shorts. He holds an arrow. This is Mambosi Jioja, the chairperson of the Sonai Hadzabe group.

The Hadzabe are communal, have a nomadic lifestyle and depend on game meat and wild fruits. For the last 30 years, however, they have never moved from here, Mambosi says. They live behind the hillock. Mambosi leads us up.

Mambosi Jioja inside a cave under a baobab tree trunk on June 2, 2023. He is the chairperson of the Hadzabe group.

As we crawl up, my heart freezes. A slide backward means an early visit to my ancestors. Furthermore, background research informed me that tiger and bark snakes are common here. I wonder if some are lurking under the rocks.

Mambosi is agile. I can't keep up with him. For a few seconds, I stand to catch a breath amid a whiff of nutty-burnt tyre air.

I ask him if a snake has stung anyone in the recent past. His response in the negative is consoling. He says they only bite if provoked. The Hadzabe don't eat snakes as many presume, Mambosi says.

We finally arrive in Sonai, where about 180 Hadzabe have settled in 35 brandy dome huts.

On a log under a towering baobab tree are men crafting sticks with knives to make arrows. A few yards behind them are women sitting on the ground watching over their merchandise lined up on makeshift display structures under the baobab tree.

Necklaces, bangles, earrings, headbands and ornamental gourds hang from the branches and hangers made from cactus, fixed on the tree. I later discover that this baobab tree, in the middle of the settlement, is a landmark serving as a special meeting point for the community.

I greet the men: “Hamjambo? (How are you?).”

I receive a rude response; they just smile and continue sharpening their arrows.

Although this community mainly speaks their native language Hadzabe, their Swahili is fluent. So they heard me. But apparently, I have broken their greeting code.

Mambosi shows me what I am expected to do. Their greeting is special. I shake their hand and say 'mtana' for hello. But the mtana is escorted with some kind of Maasai dance in the form of a rhythmic combination of sounds of kissing, clicking and mumbling like mwaah, knah, mmm, mtana!

Having mastered the art, it becomes easier to greet the women. I request to speak with the women and Katarina Hassan quickly takes the wings.

She welcomes me to her low-height hut built from branches and leaves of indigenous trees. It’s also covered with cream tarpaulin, white sack and canvas, materials left behind by visitors. It has no window—only a door of a coloured shawl.We sit down on a hide of a buffalo, covered with a coloured leso.

“What are the roles of a man and woman in your community?” I ask her.

“His work is to hunt and bring home honey for the family,” she explains. “A woman is to dig up roots and tubers and collect wild fruits.”

The environment has open patches, a clear sign of lost flora to accommodate fauna, their source of livelihood. The changing times has, however, not shifted the community’s expectations as is the case for modern society where women assume roles previously restricted to men.

“Our roles still stand. I can’t go hunting. Neither can he go collecting fruits or tubers; that is my work. That is how it is. That’s a culture passed down to us,” she reckons.

Katarina Hassan digs out a tuber on June 2, 2023.

They have, however, defied the kind of food they eat. She says the harsh weather conditions and conversion of parts of the forest to farms have disturbed the area's ecology, resulting in dwindled production and presence of their wild food.The wild animals they hunted—antelopes, wildebeests, baboons, dik-dik, buffaloes and zebras—have gone missing.

Special status

According to the UN, the Hadzabe are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer communities on Earth. In Tanzania, it is the only community allowed to source its food through hunting and gathering, says Zakaria Faustin, executive director of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum.

He says Tanzania’s first President Mwalimu Nyerere issued a decree recognising and protecting the community’s special status. The order stands, he says.

But the changing ecosystem threatens their special status. “Whenever they (animals) want to come here, they hear meee, mooo, owh, ting, ting and they run away,” Maliseli Sadiki, a young man who says he is 22, illustrates their frustration with the disappearance of the wild animals.

“These days, you walk for long until you get tired and hunger pangs and thirst overwhelm you. So, you’re forced to excavate tubers to eat. They are succulent and quench your thirst,” says Maliseli, whose dressing is like a billboard of the animals they hunt.

Katarina Hassan holds a tuber on June 2, 2023.

Hanging over his faded black T-shirt and blue knee denim short, are skins and hides of antelope, wildebeest, baboons, dik-dik, buffalo and zebra.

The community has embraced other food. “We eat rice and ugali with vegetables,” says Katarina.

“Usually, visitors bring us maize flour, rice, indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and cooking oil. If anyone gifts us with money, we use it to buy food and distribute it among ourselves.”

Togetherness

Here, nearly everything is done communally. It is the community chairperson who receives any gift on their behalf, including money and food, then he shares it out.

If it’s food, it has to be adequate enough to feed all of them. If it’s water, sourced from a borehole miles away, the money ought to be enough to buy at least one jerrycan of 20 litres for each household at Tsh1,000 (Ksh57.58).

True to Katarina’s submission, during my short time with the community, some foreign tourists gift them with maize flour, assorted indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and some money to buy cooking oil. Mambosi leads the distribution from the baobab tree, the special meeting point.

The women stretch their hands to receive the food. But there is something unique about this whole exercise.

I have witnessed food distribution exercises in Kenya’s Turkana, Baringo and Narok counties and I have never seen a man run to the house to bring a sack to the wife to collect the food. Maybe, I have not been that keen.

Gender power balance is so obvious here. In a generation where UN Women keeps calling for redistribution of household responsibilities, how this community does it is intriguing.

I ask Katarina about the power relations between men and women in their community. “Sisi ni wakali sana kwa wanaume. Sisi ndio tuna uamuzi. Uamuzi ndio wa kwetu. Tukiamua hii, sisi wanawake tumeamua, tusipoamua basi tunaacha (We are more powerful than men. We are the decision-makers and when we decide, our decision is final),” she says.

The power is rooted in marriage culture. Unlike in most cultures across the world where a woman moves into the man’s home once they marry, here, it is the opposite.

“Well, a man woos the woman but she only marries him if he accepts her terms and conditions,” explains Katarina.

“Once he accepts, she builds her house with the support of her mother and other women. The man then joins her. It is her house. Not the man’s,” she says.

The women also determine how much should be paid as reverse dowry. Years ago, they had to bring not less than three baboons, rolls of tobacco and honey, Katarina says.

A section of Sonai settlement.

But these days, due to scarcity of the wild animals, they are allowed to pay in many necklaces, as preferred by the women, and honey.

“The young man will make efforts to find honey, tobacco and necklaces,” explains Mambosi, the Sonai settlement’s chairperson. “The bride’s mother and sister to the groom will only welcome them into the house after the man has fulfilled all the dowry requirements.”

While the women help the bride to construct the house for the incoming husband, the men prepare the groom for his household responsibilities by giving him a honey bag, a skin or hide, knife and arrows, Mambosi says.

So in the case of divorce, the man only leaves with what he came with. That is his only possession. “The children belong to the women. They may have his surname, but it is the women who call the shots,” insists Katarina.

Apalii Saitoti Thufu, Katarina’s husband, proudly acknowledges the power of women here. “If she tells you to leave, you’ll leave. If she allows you to leave with the children then fine,” he says.

In jest, I interject: “But you can refuse to leave.”

He quickly counters: “How can you refuse to go, yet the house is hers. Even if you were to go with the children, where would you host them when you don’t have a house?”

“Is there a problem building a house for yourself and the children?” I ask.

He responds: “No, no! It’s not in our tradition for a man to build a house. That’s the work of women. If she chases you away, you return to your parents. And you’ll just sleep in the open or create some sort of a structure to sleep under.”

Apalii says he was born in Ghorofani, another settlement in Karatu District and moved to Sonai where his wife built a house. Together, they have two children.

I ask Katarina the main reason why women chase away the men and she says: “Kama nimechoka kuchimba mizizi si nitakuwa mkali? (How can I not be rattled if I am bogged down with excavating roots?)”

Maliseli is a victim. He was born here but had a wife in Endamaka, another settlement in Karatu district. They had two children.

But he says he recently returned to his parents, after disagreeing with his wife. She remained with the children. He says he hasn’t seen the children since he left, but given the chance, he can visit them.

He struggled to respond to the query of where he lives. “Mimi naishi kama mimi, kama mimi, kama mimi (As for me, I, I, I live).”

Unlike in many parts of Tanzania and Kenya, where female genital mutilation and child marriages are prevalent, among the Hadzabe, such harmful practices are zero. They are detested. However, girls go through a rite of passage.

A Hadzabe. Girls wear headbands once they begin menstruating.

“If a girl taints her clothes, we will know she has started her menses,” explains Mindi Saitoti, “or if she doesn’t know what’s happening, she will ask her mother.""

""The same day she makes the report, the women contribute beaded necklaces and a headband to decorate her. That shows she is mature.

""But it doesn’t mean she is ready for marriage. If a man intends to marry her, her mother must approve of it and they never do so unless she is above 18 years,” she says.

Mindi is married and has three children. She and her husband, Tabashi Chalesi, were born here. She built a house a few yards away from her parents’ and they live happily.

I am curious to find out if Tabashi finds it strange to live near his in-laws. But it sounds like a weird question.“Strange, how?” he asks.

“We are okay. What is the problem with that?”

I rest my case. Meanwhile, the men have their own way of telling when a woman is ready for marriage.

“You look at the chest. If the breasts are sagging and she has a necklace, you will know she is suitable for marriage,” says Mambosi.

Education

Although the Tanzanian government has made efforts to take its children to school, the Hadzabe who get an education still return to the forest to continue with their cultural lifestyle.

The case of Endeko. He got his secondary education in 2015 and later a diploma in governance and development through a scholarship.

But currently, he lives in his home in Yaeda Chini in Mbulu District in the Manyara region. He says forest life is less stressful.

Zakaria of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum describes the process of modernising the Hadzabe as complicated.“You help them get higher education but they still prefer to go back to the forests,” he notes.

His organisation has previously attempted to help them embrace sustainable means of livelihood but it ended in futility.

“In 2007, we supported them with goats so that they can shift from hunting to keeping goats. But during the dry season, they returned home, shot the goats and ate them,” he says.

My three-day trek in wilderness to escape abusive marriage,"Having been betrothed to a stranger husband at the age of 11 through an arranged marriage, Evelyn Kiyeny had endured occasional battering that left her weak, at times seeking treatment from health facilities.

The beating is a form of discipline reserved for women who dare defy instructions from their husbands in the patriarchal pastoral society.

The battery became worse after every child birth, when the husband would stagger home drunk, demand for food and if not ready, it translated to an instant battering. It persisted till her fifth child was born.

Unable to bear it any more, she decided to run away from her matrimonial home, but the estranged husband followed her.

“My former husband tried to convince my father that I should go back to his homestead since he had paid the dowry in full. I remained defiant and one day, he came in the company of 11 other men. They pulled me out of the house, took me to a bush and whipped me in turns until I blacked out,” recalls 29-year-old Ms Kiyeny.

Inner voice

She says after the beatings she was unconscious for a while and when she recovered, the men who had retreated some few metres away. Thinking she was dead, they came over, carried her and dumped her at a local health facility at Nginyang Township before disappearing without uttering a word to the medics.

Ms Kiyeny says while at the hospital, she heard an inner voice warning of an imminent danger and commanding her to get out of the health facility and run for safety.

“The only place I knew I had a relative was in Tangulbei Township. Though it was a long distance from our home in Nginyang, I opted to endure the hardships. I slept in the bush hungry but was lucky, the following day, to be offered shelter by a Good Samaritan,” she explains through an interpreter since she has never stepped in a classroom.

For three days, she trekked through the wilderness of Baringo County to escape from an abusive marriage she had persevered for 15 years.

She was literally running away from death, having a few days earlier experienced a severe beating by 12 men who left her half dead.

On arriving at her relative’s place, hungry, sickly and exhausted, she was taken to hospital where she was admitted for a week.

Through support from a women network, which has more than 2,800 members spread across Tiaty East Sub-county, she has managed to pick up the pieces, reunited with her children and now operates a grocery shop at Tangulbei Township.

The Action Aid project has helped her gain economic empowerment and is aware of her rights. She is actively involved in campaign on women rights through Village Savings and Lending Association (VSLA) groups where women meet weekly for a community savings and lending scheme.

Many women and girls in her Pokot community remain victims of the deep-rooted culture that subject them to inhuman treatment.

Many have been rescued from forced marriage by the women network.

“We desperately need a rescue centre in each of the six sub-counties in Baringo if the fight against retrogressive cultural practice that adversely affect the lives of Pokot girls has to be won,” says Ms Charity Lemejan, the vice secretary to Tangulbei Women Network.

Hostile and violent

“Girls are being abused day in day out. We have few children protection officers in the county with one serving three expansive sub-counties. At times, rescue missions abort since the community turns hostile and violent,” says Irene Chepkoi, a children officer based at Kabarnet Town.

The county also lacks enough charitable children institutions where rescued girls can be housed for safety, care and access education.

Ms Chepkoi says they are collaborating with other stakeholders to train child protection volunteers who can sensitise community at the villages and also report cases of child abuse.

“We have been supported by Action Aid to train volunteers based at the villages to educate the community and monitor cases of child abuse, since women who should be vocal about this vice, still believe it’s acceptable. Another approach we are using is reaching out to the community through community radio stations to educate the public on the rights of a child and how he or she can be protected,” she explains.

Ending GBV starts with teaching boys and girls about consent,"The fight against sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) can be won with proper upbringing of girls and boys, gender equality advocates say.

Miss Universe, 2019 and gender equality advocate Ms Zozibini Tunzi said normalising violence during childhood permeates into adulthood when it becomes worse.

“When you have pre-school boy and girl playing and the boy beats up the girl, the first thing that people say is ‘don’t worry. Oh he likes her?’” she said during a December 4, Fighting a Shadow Pandemic webinar convened by Foreign Policy.

“This is where it (violence against women and girls) begins. You are subconsciously teaching this young boy that love is violence. You are also teaching this young girl that to be loved is to be violated,” she added.

She said, boys and girls should be nurtured into understanding principles of gender equality. With the knowledge, the boys will respect and value the rights of girls and vice versa, she said.

“Start teaching girls and boys about consent (and) boundaries. We have to start today creating an army of men that we want to see in future,” she said.

Comprehensive data lacking

UN Women representative in South Africa, Ms Anne Githuku-Shongwe, identified lack of comprehensive data as a critical barrier to tackling SGBV.

“One of the challenges we have with data is the fact that less than 40 per cent of women report violence (and yet they are the main sources of data),” she said.

“We tend not to know what is really happening in terms of violence from country to country unless there is a full national prevalence survey,” she added.

In South Africa, she said, femicide stands at 12.5 deaths per 100,000 women which has earned its identities such as murder or rape capital of the world.

Globally, 137 women are killed every day with 50 per cent of murders committed by intimate partners thus implying that homes are not safe for women, she said.

Black Women Caucus, founder and chairperson, Ms Fatimata Moutloatse said rise in student movements has revolutionised anti-SGBV campaigns to bring to attention sexual harassment in higher learning institutions previously under the wrap.

Their activism in South Africa, for instance, catapulted President Cyril Ramaphosa into action against SGBV.

Understanding low blood pressure,"Dear doctor,

These days there is a lot of talk on high blood pressure and healthy lifestyles. Sometimes my blood pressure is high and sometimes its normal. My question is, is it better to have low blood pressure? Is there a way to get rid of it completely?

Richard



Dear Richard,

The blood pressure reading is a measure of the force at which your heart is pumping blood and the resistance to the blood flow within the blood vessels. These two measures give the two figures we use for blood pressure reading. Normal blood pressure is between 90/60mmhg and 140/90mmhg. Anything above 140/90mmhg is considered high blood pressure.

Normally, the lower the blood pressure the better, though a reading below 90/60mmhg is considered low blood pressure or hypotension. When hypotension is mild and there are no symptoms, then there’s usually no cause for concern. However, if there is reduced blood supply to the brain and other organs, then symptoms such as dizziness, fainting attacks, feeling tired, headache, neck pain, confusion, blurred vision and abnormal heart beat develop. When severe, it can lead to shock and even death. Symptomatic low blood pressure requires interventions, which may include medical treatments and lifestyle changes like taking more water and increasing sodium intake under medical guidance.

In a few people, about five to 10 per cent of those with high blood pressure, there is an exact cause for it such as kidney disease, hormonal disorders, pregnancy, anaemia, tumours, drugs or some medications. For these people, once the cause has been identified and dealt with, then the blood pressure can be sorted out.

In majority of the people, about 90 to 95 per cent of those with high blood pressure, there is no known cause why the pressure goes up. It goes higher with age and by the time it is being said to be high, it has been rising slowly over many years, and continues to do so. There are some things that are associated with this rise such as age (being over 40), being male, being African, having a close relative with high blood pressure, high-salt intake, high-calorie, high-fat diet; lack of exercise, obesity, taking too much alcohol, smoking and stressful lifestyle. Because the blood pressure rises over many years, it is not possible to cure it with medication taken for a short time. This is because the changes in the vascular system are not reversible.

Unfortunately, most of the time you cannot tell that your blood pressure is high unless it is measured. Therefore, you may be feeling fine, but the blood pressure is high and it continues to cause damage to the blood vessels and can cause stroke, heart disease, kidney failure and even loss of vision. To prevent these long term effects, you are put on medication to lower the blood pressure to normal levels. If the pressure readings are normal, then the medicine is working. If you stop taking the medicine, the blood pressure goes back up, which is why it is very important for you to keep taking the medicine.

In addition to that, reduce the amount of salt (sodium),  fat and starch in your diet to healthy levels, reduce alcohol intake, stop smoking, reduce weight to healthy levels, exercise, take a potassium-rich diet with lots of vegetables and fruits (avoid potassium supplements), have enough sleep and manage stress.

When the blood pressure readings are between 120 to 140mmhg systolic and 80 to 90mmhg diastolic, what is considered as pre=hypertension or high-normal pressure, the lifestyle changes can help delay or prevent development of high blood pressure. Additionally, if you are diagnosed to have high blood pressure stage 1 (systolic 140 to 159mmhg and diastolic 90-99mmhg), you may be advised to do lifestyle modification for six months while being monitored for lowering of blood pressure before being started on medication.  It is advisable for you to check your blood pressure and visit the physician regularly for monitoring, early intervention and to avoid complications related to blood pressure abnormalities.



I am 43 years old and I have been trying to get pregnant for some time. Can folic acid help improve my fertility? Phyllis



Dear Phyllis,

Folic acid is useful for different functions in the body, especially the formation of red blood cells. Folic acid/folate supplements (a form of vitamin B9) help to build up the folate stores in the body so that you have enough to “share” with the forming baby during pregnancy, and this is important to prevent development of disorders of the brain and spine (neural tube disorders). Because of this, it is advisable to start taking them once you intend to get pregnant so that once you conceive, the body already has enough stores, and to continue taking the folic acid supplements at least for the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy. The folic acid supplements, however, do not increase fertility.

For women, the highest number of eggs one will ever have are the ones present at birth and they decline over time. The “peak” fertile period is between the late teens and the 20s. After 30, fertility starts to drop, and this drop is most significant from around age 35. From age 40, the possibility of achieving a pregnancy is about 5-10 per cent with each cycle. This means that it is possible to get pregnant in your 40s, but it may take a bit longer. The other challenges with getting pregnant in your 40s is that there is a higher chance of abnormalities for the baby and a higher risk of complications during pregnancy.

The other possible causes of reduced fertility include abnormal ovarian function, hormonal disorders, fallopian tube obstruction and abnormalities of the uterus.

It is advisable for any woman above 40 planning a pregnancy to see a gynaecologist from before conception, and from very early in the pregnancy. In the case of delayed conception, the gynaecologist review can help isolate the exact problem and chart a course of management since different causes of reduced fertility have different treatments.

John-Allan Namu's letter to 24-year-old self,"

Award winning journalist, John-Allan Namu, talks about how the conflicts he experienced in his 20s lead him to be more intentional and compassionate in his personal and professional life.

Media personality John Allan Namu has opened up about life in his 20’s, and the lessons that shaped who he is now.

Speaking to content creator Wabosha Maxine, Namu explained: “I was always looking for someone in the ""it"" crowd mainly because of my own imposter syndrome. I felt that I was not enough on my own so I needed someone who was whole so that that fairy dust can just sprinkle itself on me. I wanted someone whose attention was on me so that I could dote on her, that was the kind of person I was looking for at the time.""

On his journey to discovery, Namu realised his idea of a relationship is as flimsy as  a house of cards with no semblance of a foundation. This is after he met his wife Makena.

""She is extremely attractive, very outgoing, very curious about the world, never afraid to ask the question that will get the conversation going and get you to learn,"" Namu said.

This has made him come up with what he calls the Makena posture.

""I will not act like I know everything, I will go and ask everything,"" he noted.

The media personality goes ahead to explain what unique 'X factor' his wife has that his exes did not.

Midega had taken out a huge bet of Sh80,000 on this game. The money was not his. He had diverted funds given to him by his elder brother to settle household bills. But Midega was sure he would return the money before anyone noticed it was gone.

He was wrong.

Little angel gone too soon,"Lena* lay on her back, spent. She was barely conscious but she kept mumbling about her baby. She wanted to know why she could not hear her baby cry. However, she was so tired, her voice was barely audible. No one gave her an answer. They were focused on the baby.

The midwife finally cleaned Lena up and transferred her to the postnatal ward. Lena was exhausted. She gratefully sank into a deep sleep. She had been in labour for over 24 hours, with neither sleep nor nourishment.

With the introduction of the free maternity care under the Linda Mama benefits scheme in Kenya, many small private facilities signed up with the National Hospital Insurance Fund, now renamed National Health Insurance Fund, as service providers. However, the manner in which the fund was structured did not address certain important aspects.

For facilities to claim reimbursement for services rendered, they had to present evidence of the actual delivery. This means that if the facility monitored the patient for seven hours and the patient developed complications that required that the patient be referred for more specialised delivery services, the referring facility was not reimbursed for costs thus far.

This unfortunate oversight resulted in patients being held in facilities with the hope that they will deliver, causing unwarranted delays and unfortunate outcomes for the mother and baby. This was the case for Lena. She was kept at a level three private maternity home for 24 hours before she was referred to the level four public facility. Eventually, the prolonged labour resulted in severe consequences for her baby. Lena was dehydrated and exhausted by the time she arrived at the public hospital. The maternity team quickly initiated resuscitation and prepared Lena for caesarian section. She was transferred to the operating room but before surgery commenced, she was able to deliver vaginally, with assistance, using special equipment. But the baby was not so lucky.

The little one was unable to breathe well after delivery, having suffered birth asphyxia. During this prolonged duration of labour, baby was not able to get sufficient oxygen through the placenta and umbilical cord. This resulted in injury to the baby’s brain cells due to insufficient oxygenation.

Lena’s baby had to be transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit at the national referral facility. It means that Lena’s sleep had to be interrupted and she joined her baby in the ambulance.

It was tough 10 days while Lena watched her baby on a ventilator. Baby fought hard for her life but it wasn’t easy. The dominos began to fall. First it was the convulsions that would not let up, further aggravating her brain injury. She had to be put on anticonvulsants. Just when the neonatologists thought they had things under control, next came infection. Her antibiotics had to be switched to stronger ones. This was quickly followed by kidney failure. At a measly 3200g, she had to start on dialysis. Her body was struggling to balance the salt levels.

Lena cried so long, she had no more tears left. She would sit for hours at her baby’s bedside. Her mother sat with her all day and left in the evening. She tried to convince Lena to eat but it was in vain. She would take a few sips of uji throughout the day as her daily sustenance. She was ready to be a single mother after her partner succumbed to Covid-19 before Lena even knew she was pregnant, but she did not envisage starting out this way. On the fifth day, the doctors thought the baby was looking better. Her blood tests showed that the infection was coming under control and the convulsions were few and far apart. She had even started making a few drops of urine. This great progress lasted all of three days before things truly fell apart. The convulsions increased in frequency despite treatment and a new wave of infection (neonatal sepsis) set in. For the next 48 hours, it was all touch and go. Lena was besides herself with anguish. Her mother camped at the hospital all night with Lena until morning when the doctors concluded that there wasn’t anything else that could be done for her.

After a spirited fight for 10 days, baby finally let go. Lena only got to hold her daughter for the first time in death. She never suckled her baby, never changed a diaper, never gave her a bath, never got to dress her in the cute little clothes she had bought.

Her baby joined painful statistic of 21 deaths per 1,000 babies born alive, who lose their lives within the first 28 days of being born. This figure remains way too high despite having come down by a third over the past two decades. Even worse is that out of all children losing their lives before their fifth birthday, half of these deaths happen before they see their first month of life.

It is inevitable that there are babies we will lose in this period immediately after birth as a result of unpreventable complications such as congenital abnormalities that are incompatible with life, extreme prematurity and genetic abnormalities. However, the larger proportion of deaths is preventable and we must strive to avoid them. The race to save a life already compromised is one we do not easily win and one that costs thousands of shillings.

It is not enough that maternity and perinatal care is free to the mother. We must ensure that the care provided is of good quality and that the entire system of service delivery works properly. Financing maternity and perinatal care must be thought through to ensure appropriate, safe and efficient delivery of care without gaps that compromise these tenets and become a threat to life.

It is time we dried Lena’s tears; no newborn baby should die of preventable death!

Step up efforts to end preventable deaths of newborns.

Help! My wife blames me for her recurrent urinary tract infections,"Dear Doc,

My wife has been having recurrent urinary tract infections and surprisingly she blames me and accuses me of being unfaithful. Are UTIs sexually transmitted? And if not, what could be causing my wife this problem?

Kevo, Eldoret



Dear Kevo,

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are infections within the urinary tract, that is, either in the kidney, ureter, bladder or urethra. UTIs are quite common in women and in about 20 per cent of all women, the UTIs are recurrent — they keep coming back. Some people may have recurrent UTIs for no good reason, while in others, it may be due to abnormalities in the structures of the urinary system, or it may be due to pregnancy, steroid use, spinal cord injury, nerve problems, kidney stones or some immune disorders.

In most cases, the bacteria that cause UTIs are the ones that live in the intestines, and they can travel from the anus to the urethral opening (where urine comes out), since the two are not far from each other. Women also have a very short urethra (the tube that carries urine to the outside) compared to men, which makes it easier for bacteria to travel up to the bladder and cause infection there. The bacteria can also get to the urethra when using a dirty toilet due to splashing, and also due to the close contact during sexual intercourse. In addition to this, when there is a sexually transmitted infection, it can cause infection within the reproductive structures and also within the urinary system. Regardless of whether it originated from an STI or not, having multiple partners increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and breeds an environment of mistrust that can destroy a relationship.

Having a UTI may cause a burning or irritating sensation when passing urine, feeling very pressed, urine leaking out before getting to the toilet, going to urinate many times, even though very little urine comes out; change in urine colour and/or smell, blood in urine, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, fever and chills, nausea, bloating and feeling tired.

It is important to note that someone can have UTI-like symptoms that are caused by inflammation of the urinary bladder (cystitis) due to other causes other than infection. These include some medications, radiation, other chronic illnesses and interstitial cystitis. UTIs are treated with antibiotics after a urine test. Due to the recurrence, she should also have a urine culture done. She may also benefit from a vaginal swab for analysis and culture. For recurrent UTIs, she may be given a low dose antibiotic to take over a long time. She may also be advised to take an antibiotic every time after sexual intercourse or take antibiotics for a short time (one or two days) every time she gets symptoms. She can also learn how to do a urine test at home every time she gets symptoms to make sure that it is a urine infection.  To prevent urinary tract infections, she can do this:

Go to the toilet as soon as she needs to and empty the bladder completely

Always use a clean toilet

Take a lot of water daily, not just when there’s an infection

Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting trousers

Avoid using scented soaps, feminine hygiene products and douches

Wipe herself from front to back

Both of you should clean the genital area thoroughly before sexual intercourse and urinate immediately after

Barrier contraceptive methods such as condoms, diaphragms and spermicides can cause irritation, so consider using another method. When using a condom, make sure you use a good lubricant.



I sexual intercourse with this lady a month ago and now she says she’s pregnant. I doubt it is mine since we used protection and besides that, I found out that the pregnancy is four weeks and a few days old. How do I get DNA done before that child is born?

K, Nairobi



Dear K,

In the first place,  it is possible for a pregnancy to occur even when you have used a barrier method/protection such as  a condom. This may be due to contact with pre-ejaculate fluid if the condom was not used throughout the encounter. The other reasons for this would be rupture of the condom or spillage during withdrawal/removal. It is possible to do paternity DNA testing during pregnancy by isolating the baby’s DNA from the mother’s blood between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. If the result is inconclusive, it needs to be confirmed by using amniotic fluid or chorionic villus sampling, where a sample is taken from the tissues surrounding the growing fetus. These procedures are invasive and may trigger a miscarriage so it is best to wait for the baby to be born. For any of these tests, you need the consent of the mother and the possible father(s) and you may require legal consent, and the tests require a complex medical procedure.

In regards to the reported age of the pregnancy, medical practitioners count the age of a pregnancy from the day the last periods started, not from the day someone got pregnant. For example, if someone got pregnant four weeks ago and they had their periods two weeks before that, the pregnancy is said to be six weeks old. This counting system, however, is not exact, so you cannot determine paternity definitively based on that.



What does the word genetic mean? Is it different from generic drugs?

Ali



Genetics refers to the biological make-up of an individual based on the genes they have. Genes are units of biological material found in our cells that “dictate” how our body develops and different traits that we get. We get a set of genes from each of our parents, which means that traits are passed down from our parents to us such as skin colour, hair colour, eye colour and blood type. Genes could also carry traits that cause disease or that make it easier for someone to get a particular disease, for example hypertension, diabetes, sickle cell disease, some cancers, some psychiatric disorders, among others. This means that there are some diseases that we are at higher risk of developing if our parents or other close relatives also had them.

The active ingredient in a drug is known as the generic name of that drug. This is different from the brand name, which is the name given to that drug by a specific company. For example, the active ingredient chlorpheniramine (generic name) is known by the brand name piriton, allergy relief, Nyquil, Chlorphen ...

Another use of the term generic is in reference to medication that is made to be similar to the original medicine that was developed by a specific company. This generic medication is similar to the original medication, but is usually cheaper since the company that developed the original molecule had to bear the cost of developing the drug, taking it through research and drug trials and seek approval from the relevant authorities.

When menopause comes too early,"Ayeema* sat forlornly across from me, biting her nails, a habit she had refused to drop since childhood. She was nervous but pretending to be all right. I had known Ayeema since she was born. This is one habit her mum had lost the fight on.

Ayeema’s mother, Hawa*, sat next to Ayeema and literally took over the conversation. This was the Hawa I grew up knowing; she hadn’t changed a bit! Hawa would speak on behalf of everyone, like the predestined spokesperson, even when she had no business talking.

Today, however, she was just a worried mother. Ayeema had not had periods for a whole year. Though Ayeema did not seem to mind her situation, Hawa made it her business to seek help. Ayeema started her period when she was 15. For the next decade, she had a fairly normal flow but at 25, her periods became lighter and irregular until they altogether disappeared. It had been over a year since she had last bled. What got mum concerned was when Ayeema started manifesting symptoms that were all too familiar.

Hawa was going through menopause, with the classical symptoms of hot flashes, poor sleep patterns, change in appetite, anxiety and mood swings. She was quite startled to find the same symptoms, albeit a little subdued, in Ayeema. She was worried. She wanted to see her grandchildren before she died.

Ayeema noted that her periods had never been remarkable. They came a little later than most of her peers but she had always been a tiny one, so she thought it was expected. The longest she ever bled was three days, but most times she would have periods for a day or two. The periods were light and she only got mild period pains.

Three years back, she noted the periods becoming irregular. She would get a period every two to three months, which progressed to just twice in the year and then ceased completely for almost a year now.

A thorough examination revealed that Ayeema’s adolescent transition had taken  place appropriately, with normal breast development, normal body hair distribution a normal female habitus. She did not demonstrate any signs of other hormonal problems and save for her menses going on strike, she was otherwise in perfect health.

Medical tests done on Ayeema revealed that she did not have any chromosomal abnormalities. Her reproductive hormones were at menopausal levels. An ultrasound of her pelvis noted that her ovaries were present but abnormally small. Her uterus was quite small, the size of a pre-adolescent girl’s.

It was heartbreaking to inform Ayeema and Hawa of the diagnosis. Ayeema had suffered premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), or premature menopause as better described in simpler terms. If I thought Ayeema had taken the news hard, I hadn’t quite comprehended what this would do to Hawa.

Hawa went into denial. She quickly dragged Ayeema off to the United States where part of the family resided, for a second and third opinion. The upside was that Ayeema was further able to be screened for multiple possible causes of POI, which we hadn’t yet done as the sample specimen would require to be shipped abroad.

Thankfully all the screens for the rarer autoimmune disorders were negative. Having eliminated all known causes of POI, Ayeema joined the 70 per cent of women with the condition, categorised as idiopathic premature ovarian insufficiency. For these patients, the fact that there is no identifiable cause of the condition means that we are not able to modify its outcomes by treating the cause.

The first order of business was to confront Ayeema’s reality regarding her fertility. POI meant that she had a less than negligible possibility of conception as her ovaries had  no more viable eggs left. A few patients with POI, especially those whose POI is caused by autoimmune diseases, being able to tame the autoimmune disease may result in a slight improvement in ovarian function, which may result in a conception. Unfortunately for Ayeema, this was not the case. She would have to be content with the fact that she would never be able to sire her own biological children.  Aside from that, the early decline in the female reproductive hormones has a direct impact on multiple systems in the body. A decline in oestrogen levels directly results in osteoporosis. This is why elderly post-menopausal women make up the majority of patients with osteoporosis. This puts them at high risk of fractures, even from low-impact forces. For a person with POI, the risk sets in way too early, compromising the quality of life.

Further, their cardiovascular risk index disproportionately rises, putting them at risk of events such as stroke and heart attacks. As if that’s not enough, there is a marked impact on their cognitive function, resulting in earlier onset, more severe forms of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. The condition further predisposes to obesity, insulin resistance, and inappropriate cholesterol synthesis, increasing the risk for diabetes and high cholesterol levels.  Walking Ayeema through all these complications was important for her to understand the justification for proposing long-term hormone replacement therapy as part of her treatment plan. Further, she is more conscious of her lifestyle, making informed choices in order to keep undesired outcomes at bay.  Unfortunately, by virtue of being a practising Muslim, her religion does not permit the practice of using donor eggs for in-vitro fertilisation, hence the dream of ever becoming a mum is currently quashed.  Both Ayeema and Hawa were referred to a counselling psychologist.  It was important for Ayeema to go through the healing journey and accept herself.

It was even more important for Hawa to accept her daughter and be able to provide Ayeema with the necessary support.

Today, Ayeema finds fulfilment in the early childhood development center she opened a year ago. It allows her to experience children from a different perspective and find her joy. Hawa, well, she will always be Hawa! We love her as she is.

"Doc, do muscle cramps signal a more serious problem?","Doc,

Since a year ago, my hands intermittently jerk and twitch when I type for a long period. For instance, I will be typing a report and the moment I take a pause, my full hands quickly jerk straight up and then back down onto the keys. I don’t know if this matters, but I don’t consume alcohol or drugs. What could be the issue?



The jerking and twitching of the hand is due to involuntary muscle spasms. The sudden, brief contraction (and relaxation) of a muscle or group of muscles causing twitching or jerking is called myoclonus. A possible cause of this is muscle spasms triggered by strenuous activity. It can also be due to carpal tunnel syndrome, where one of the major nerves going to your hands is compressed near your wrist due to inflammation that may be triggered by repetitive hand motions, or as a result of pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and others. Carpal tunnel syndrome may also cause numbness, tingling of the fingers, weakness and pain that may shoot up the arm.

Dehydration and caffeine intake can also cause involuntary muscle spasms. Problems with the nervous system or the brain can also cause myoclonus.

Rest, hydration and avoiding caffeine can help reduce the occurrence of the muscle spasms that are triggered by these.

However, if the twitching is recurrent, it is advisable to be seen by a doctor for examination for any underlying problems and to institute appropriate management for the same.



Dear Doc,

My daughter is turning 16 years in a week’s time. However, she is yet to get her menstrual period. Every other 28 days, she experiences painful cramping but not the menstruation. Should I be worried?



Dear parent,

The beginning of menstruation is called menarche and it can occur between ages 10 and 16, though the average age is 12.4 years. The timing of menarche depends on a number of factors including genetics, nutritional status, general health, exercise levels and socioeconomic status. The first period usually occurs without warning and may be painless. Initially, the cycles occur without ovulation so they tend to be irregular in timing and amount/length of bleeding.

For menarche to happen, there should be normal hormonal systems, normal anatomy and good general health. When there are no periods, in the absence of pregnancy, this is called amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea means that there have never been any menses at all, while secondary amenorrhea is when there is absence of menses for three cycles or for six months in someone who was previously receiving their periods.

If a female has normal physical growth and normal secondary sexual development but has not had menarche by age 15, then this is primary amenorrhea. This can be due to genetic problems that affect the reproductive system or due to hormonal problems or a structural problem with the reproductive organs such as missing or underdeveloped organs, or having an imperforate hymen (a hymen that does not have a space to allow the menstrual blood to pass through).

It is advisable for her to be reviewed by a gynaecologist to establish the cause of the primary amenorrhea and appropriate intervention.





Dear doctor,

What are hemorrhoids?

Alnashir D Walji



Dear Alnashir,

Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are veins that swell or bulge out in the lower part of the rectum and anus. The walls of the veins become inflamed or irritated and stretch out, easily tearing and bleeding especially when passing stool. The hemorrhoids may be on the outside around the anal opening: these are called external hemorrhoids. Or they may be inside and “come out” when passing stoo, and sometimes can be pushed back in, which are called prolapsed hemorrhoids. If they are far up inside that they cannot be seen or felt, they are called internal hemorrhoids. Symptoms include a painful or itchy swelling at the anal opening and pain or bleeding when passing stool. If the blood within the prolapsed veins clots, this is a thrombosed hemorrhoid and it will be felt as a very painful hard lump.

About 75 per cent of all adults will develop hemorrhoids at one point in their lifetime. The cause may be unknown or they may be caused by straining when passing stool such as due to constipation or diarrhoea. They may also be caused by any activity that causes repeated high pressure in the abdominal region such as a persistent cough or lifting weights. They are also more common in people who stand or sit for long periods of time and also during pregnancy. Most of the time they resolve easily with diet and lifestyle changes and with treatment, though they can recur.

To prevent hemorhhoids and to manage them, prevent constipation through:

- adequate fluid intake

- taking a high fibre diet everyday

- regular exercise (150 minutes of moderate exercise per week)

When opening bowels, take your time and you can use a small stool to raise your legs while sitting on the toilet or use a squat toilet. Because the tissue around the anus is irritated or injured, you can use flushable baby wipes instead of toilet paper and you can also take a sitz bath: sit in warm water for about 20min twice a day to help soothe the injured tissue.

There are fibre supplements that you can take to help with passing soft stools. There are other laxatives and stool softeners which can be prescribed by the doctor. There are creams and suppositories that can be used to help with the healing of the inflammed tissue. There are also oral tablets that are prescribed to help with the prolapsed veins.

In case symptoms persist despite these measures, surgery may need to be done to correct the problem.

The gradual loss of vision,"Dear doctor,

My mum, 64, has been having problems with her eyesight. She was told that the pressure in her eyes is high. How is this possible yet she does not have night blood pressure? What causes it? Does it have treatment?



Dear reader,

The eye has various components including two types of fluid that give it shape by maintaining the pressure inside the eye. The first type of liquid is called aqueous humor and it is clear. It is found between the cornea and the lens (the front part of the eye), and the second type is vitreous humor, which is a thick gel-like fluid found between the lens and the retina (the back of the eye). The aqueous humor nourishes the eye and gives it shape. It is produced by the eye and a similar amount of what is produced per day is removed from the eye through a drainage system.

If there is excess aqueous humor produced or a blockage in the drainage system, there is a buildup of fluid, increasing the pressure inside the eye. This high pressure can damage the optic nerve, which starts at the back of the eye. This is the nerve that allows us to see. The nerve is made up of small nerve fibres. As the nerve fibres are destroyed, blind spots develop and  the entire nerve is damaged, and then there is complete blindness in that eye.

The name given to this disease where increased intra-ocular pressure (pressure inside the eye) damages the optic nerve is glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in persons over 60 years old, but the blindness can be prevented with early treatment.

There are several types of glaucoma: open angle glaucoma, which develops because of “clogging” of the drainage system. It develops slowly over time and usually has no symptoms until much later in the course of the disease. There’s closed angle or angle-closure glaucoma, which occurs when another part of the eye (the iris) suddenly blocks the drainage angle, causing the pressure to rise very quickly and thus causing eye pain, headache, nausea, seeing halos, blurred vision and can quickly cause blindness. There’s also normal pressure glaucoma, where there is damage to the optic nerve despite the intra-ocular pressure being within normal limits.

Someone has a higher risk of developing glaucoma if they have close family members who have/had glaucoma; or if aged above 40 years; or if they are long or short sighted; if they have had an eye injury; or if they have problems with the cornea or the optic nerve. There is also a higher risk of glaucoma for persons who have diabetes, high blood pressure, poor circulation and other chronic illnesses. Long term use of steroids also increases the risk of developing glaucoma.

High intra-ocular pressure and glaucoma should be treated by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). While damage from glaucoma cannot be reversed, further damage can be prevented using medication or surgery. Eye drops may be used to reduce the amount of aqueous humor being made or to improve the drainage. Surgery may also be done to improve the drainage and/or to reduce the pressure from the other part of the eye.



Dear doctor,

What is the link between eye twitching and headaches? Should I be concerned?



Dear reader,

Eye twitching is movement or spasms of the eyelids. There are different types of twitching. One type of twitching, which is rare, is benign essential blepharospasms, which starts as frequent blinking and can lead to the eyes being squeezed shut and can be quite severe. It may be caused by a problem with the nerves. Another type of twitching is hemifacial spasm, which affects one side of the face. This is may be caused by a blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve.

The most common type of twitching is called myokimia, where the twitching is mild, lasts for a short while, resolves on its own and recurs. There is no known cause for this, but it may be triggered by bright light, eye strain, eye irritation, fatigue, alcohol intake, smoking, wind, air pollution, excess caffeine intake and stress. Other conditions that can cause eye twitching include light sensitivity, inflammation of the eyes, some nerve disorders and some medications.

Recurrent headaches may be tension headaches, migraine headaches or cluster headaches. They may also be caused by an underlying illness. Some of the triggers of eye twitching can also trigger headaches such as stress, fatigue, eye strain, bright light, air pollution and nerve disorders. Eye disorders may also trigger a headache.

For myokimia, the twitching usually resolves on its own with rest, reduction of caffeine and stress relief. For the other types of twitching, it is advisable to be reviewed by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). Any other eye problems should also be treated by a doctor.

For recurrent headaches, if they cannot be controlled by avoiding the triggers and simple painkillers, then it is advisable to be reviewed by a doctor. This is because there are many possible underlying causes of headaches. Once the underlying cause is identified, the specific treatment will be given.

Everything you need to know about your gut,"In 2014, a German medical doctor and author, Giulia Enders, published a book titled –Gut; Inside Story of World’s Most Underrated Organ. It was received quite well and has so far been translated to about 30 languages. While the humour in it is unmatched, the lessons therein about the gut are memorable and important.

Years later, there seems to be a twist to that. The gut is not sold short. A new craze is cropping up online about the gut’s health and lately, content creators on TikTok and YouTube are amassing a huge following by sharing insights about what Enders classified as the ‘most underrated organ’.

Some of the people who share such content may not be professionals, which is why before taking in anything they say, speaking to a nutritionist or medical doctor will help in vindicating their posts.

Healthy Nation spoke to Abigael Kabui, a nutritionist passionate about the gut’s health, to help in elucidating all these fuss about the gut. “Your gut is your second brain,” she says.

Rightfully so as a reviewed article published in science based publication, WebMD, shows that the name given to this second brain is ‘enteric nervous system (ENS)’. Another article published on the Harvard University website shows that the brain communicates directly with the gut system –elaborating that when someone falls sick because of a certain food, they will try to avoid the place where they got it from.

“If your gut is not okay, you are generally not happy. Also, did you know that serotonin, a happy hormone, works in the brain yet it is produced in the gut?” Poses Abigael.

She explains that gut health is the overall well-being and proper functioning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which includes the stomach, small intestine, large intestine and colon. For it to be healthy, it is influenced by complex interactions between the microbiota (the community of microorganisms living in the gut), the gut lining, the immune system, and various factors such as diet, lifestyle and stress.

“When the gut is healthy, it maintains a balance of beneficial bacteria, supports the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients and helps defend against harmful pathogens. A healthy gut also contributes to overall well-being as it has been linked to various aspects of health, including mental health, immune function and even chronic disease prevention,” she explains.

Abigael notes that for a gut to be healthy, it should have a balance of bacteria in a ratio of 85:15, the good, trumping the bad. But, in our daily lives, we disrupt the functioning of the gut, which destroys the good bacteria. However, there is a solution and it is found in probiotics.

“A probiotic is a live microorganism, typically bacteria or yeasts, that when consumed in adequate amounts confers health benefits on the host. These beneficial microorganisms can colonise the gut and interact with the existing gut microbiota, promoting a healthy microbial balance,” she explains.

Some of the foods that contain probiotics are yoghurt, buttermilk, apple cider vinegar and some types of cheese.

Abigael, like Giulia Enders, is on a mission to preach the gospel of the gut and how to maintain it. After her studies, she came up with a food probiotic called Sauerkraut that is still in the process of review by relevant authorities in the country. It is a portmanteau of two German words, sauer, which means sour and kaut —cabbage. According to an article published in the New York Times, this food probiotic originated from China during the building of the Great Wall.

The masons lived on cabbage and rice. They used wine made from rice as a preservative to ferment the cabbage during winter, which forms the present day Sauerkraut. “This is cabbage fermented under certain temperatures in a certain environment for a number of days. When all conditions are in place, the product has lactobacillus bacteria with a number of strains, which is the good bacteria that we are looking for,” she explains.

She says people should not just use probiotics in their gut because they want to, advising that seeing a nutritionist is ideal.

“It is first important to note that you need to first eliminate what is causing your gut issues. This is where our nutrition knowledge also comes in line. After eliminating, you can now introduce the probiotics into your diet,” she says

Apart from ensuring there is a balance between the good and bad bacteria, Abigael explains that using probiotics helps in easing digestive issues such as bloating, gas, constipation and diarrhoea.

“Antibiotics can disrupt the balance of gut bacteria, leading to issues such as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Taking probiotics during and after antibiotic treatment may help restore the natural gut microbiota and reduce the risk of such complications.”

She advises that to check the right probiotic, you have to ensure that the bacteria strain is present in it.She advises that apart from getting probiotics to improve your gut health, there are other alternatives that you may explore.

“A nutrient-rich and balanced diet is crucial for promoting gut health. Consuming a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats provides essential nutrients and fiber that support a healthy gut microbiota.”

“Engaging in regular physical activity has been linked to improved gut health. Exercise can help stimulate gut motility and promote a diverse gut microbiota. Chronic stress can negatively impact gut health by altering gut motility, increasing inflammation and disrupting the gut microbiota,” she adds.

Abigael says incorporating stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga or engaging in hobbies can help reduce stress and promote a healthy gut. She also notes that sleep deprivation can affect the gut microbiota, increase inflammation and impact digestion.

Wonder porridge keeping learners in school,"A special herbal porridge being provided to schoolgoing children has boosted deworming efforts and increased enrolment in learning institutions, according to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri).

The Uji plus porridge, a brainchild of Terik community, was approved last month by Kemri after clinical trials were conducted in Nandi, Kirinyaga and Homa Bay counties.

The community had requested partnership with Kemri to support in scientific formulation and clinical trials of the porridge.

Kemri Director-General Maritim Songok noted that the herbal formulation designed to be taken as a school meal snack for nutrition and deworming was found to be 100 per cent effective.

He explained that the porridge eradicates skin infections including ring worms.  Prof Songok said results from the clinical trials indicated that the children who took the porridge were free from worms, their immune had been boosted and their performance in school improved.

The director-general urged the Ministry of Education and all the 47 county governments to ensure that all school going children have access to the porridge that has clinically proven to be effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis in children under six years.

He added that professionals from the Terik community have been working in collaboration with leading scientists from Japan and Canada universities.

Speaking at Kapsengere Primary School where Kemri handed over the product to the local community, Prof Songok said the porridge met all the requirements.

Terik Council Chairman John Bor said the community is in the process of setting up a factory to produce the porridge in large quantities. Already, the product has been patented with the Kenya Intellectual Property Institute .

Parents and local leaders said many learners who had dropped out of school resumed after the feeding programme was introduced.

Education officials in Nandi County said the number of children in  Early Childhood Education classes had doubled in eight local primary schools.

For instance, at Kapsengere Primary School had 24 children in ECDE but the numbers had increased to 45 children since provision of the porridge.

“We want to urge communities in Kenya who have unique herbal products that we can partner with to come forward and work with us. We will not take away your innovation. We are a public institution and we will continue to serve communities,” said Prof Songok.

Quickfire with Prof Songok

Is there any recommendation amount of Uji plus? Yes, during our clinical trials one cup of 300ml daily of Uji plus taken for two months had a good effect.

What’s the impact on enrolment?There was nearly a 100 per cent enrolment in schools where we introduced the porridge. The Introduction of school feeding programmes increases enrolment especially in rural and slum schools.

How many schools benefited from the porridge?At least 17 schools in three counties: Nandi, Kirinyaga and Homa Bay. Total number of children who took the porridge was 2,100. Clinical trials and analysis were done from 2012 to 2021.

Can it be a solution to high level of malnutrition?Yes.The greatest impact was actually observed on nutrition rather than deworming- increased appetite in children, increased weight, increased haemoglobin content with significant reduction in anemia cases.

Has it been patented?Yes, it has both a Kenya Industrial Property Institute patent and a World Intellectual Property organisation patent.

Can it be infused with other products such as milk to achieve similar results? We don’t know because we haven’t tested.

Bleeding after childbirth: What’s normal and what’s not,"Dear Healthy Nation,

I delivered through caesarian-section 10 weeks ago. Anytime I try doing some simple recommended exercise, I bleed. What could be the issue?

Anne



Dear Anne,

After giving birth, whether through caesarian-section or vaginal delivery, there is vaginal bleeding/discharge for six to eight weeks. This is called lochia and it changes over time. In the first three to four days, there is lochia rubra, which is red, and the flow is heavy, sometimes with small clots, and may be accompanied by cramping. After that, there is lochia serosa, where the discharge becomes thinner and is pinkish or brownish in colour and lasts for four to 12 days. The last stage, lochia alba, has a yellowish or white discharge with spotting and lasts for two to six weeks. Physical activity can cause heavier discharge or even cause the bleeding to start again. For this reason, it is advisable to rest and be careful with the engagement in physical activity including regular activities like climbing stairs.

The bleeding may also be due to post-partum hemorrhage, which is abnormal or heavy bleeding within 24 hours to 12 weeks after giving birth. This is a serious condition that requires urgent medical intervention.  It may be due to retained placenta, infection within the uterus, a bleeding disorder, hormonal disorders or due to a urinary tract infection.

It is advisable for you to be reviewed by a gynaecologist urgently for review. If there is postpartum hemorrhage, then the underlying cause will be addressed. If the bleeding is lochia that is prolonged or reactivated by exercise, then you need to rest and be extra careful with physical activity.





Dear Doc,

I am 22. I was born with one testicle. Recently I started getting worried about by sex life. I’m a devout Muslim and I have never engaged in sexual intercourse. I am worried about my marital life: maybe I won’t satisfy my wife or maybe I won’t sire children. What should I do? How will I get help? Kindly advise



Dear reader,

When there is only one testicle in the scrotal sac, this is called monorchia or monorchidism. It could be because one testicle was not formed at all or it is undescended. When the baby is forming during pregnancy, the testicles develop within the abdomen and then travel down to the scrotal sac during the last three months of pregnancy. If the testicles have not descended by the time of birth, in most boys, they will come down within the first six months. If the testicles are missing, then one or both testicles may be trapped within the path between the abdomen and the scrotum, and if this is the case, surgery can be done to bring the testicle(s) down and attach it/them to the scrotal sac. However, for the undescended testicle to be able to function normally, then it needs to be corrected within the first year of life.

It is advisable for you to be reviewed by a doctor and get an ultrasound scan to determine whether the second testicle is undescended or if it never formed. If it is undescended, it needs to be located and corrected or removed depending on where it is found and the condition it is in.

For those with one healthy testicle, the sexual function and fertility is usually normal, so unless there are other attendant issues, you should be able to have a mutually satisfying relationship with your future spouse and to have children, should you so wish.



What is a cyst and how does it develop?

Please shed light on this.



Dear reader,

A cyst is an abnormal pocket of fluid or semi-solid material that can form anywhere in the body including the skin, brain, bones and internal organs. Most cysts are non-cancerous and may vary from very small in size to very large, and sometimes may be painful. It may also cause a swelling or a lump. Cysts do not usually cause problems unless they are very large, or they are infected, or they are pressing on a nerve or a blood vessel or if they are affecting how an organ works or if they are cancerous.

A cyst may form as a result of an injury, or due to blockage of a duct or passage; or because of a problem with the body tissue in a particular area, or due to infection with a parasite. It may also be as a result of genetic changes or due to inflammation. Rarely, a cyst will be cancerous. All abnormal lumps in the body should be examined, including cysts. Depending on the location, the contents and the symptoms, the cyst may be left untouched, or it may be surgically removed. After removal, the contents are examined for cancer and any identifiable cause such as an infection. Sometimes cysts may develop complications like pain, infection, bleeding and inflammation of surrounding tissues in case they rupture.

When a person’s blood is ‘excess’ and requires to be extracted,"Dear Healthy Nation,

Is there a condition where someone has too much blood in the body that needs to be removed? Does it have any negative side effects? My neighbour died suddenly last week, and this was said to be the cause. Is that possible?

Dear reader,

There is a rare condition called polycythemia or erythrocytosis, where there is a high concentration of red blood cells in the blood, making the blood thicker than it should be, and it flows sluggishly through the blood vessels.

Polycythemia can cause dizziness, fainting, headache, blurred vision, high blood pressure, bleeding problems, or itchy skin. The sluggish blood flow can also lead to development of a blood clot, which can be deadly if the clot blocks blood flow to vital organs, like the lungs.

Polycythemia may be as a result of a genetic disorder known as Polycythimia Vera that leads to excessive production of red blood cells. It may also develop as a result of having excessive erythropoietin, the hormone that promotes production of red blood cells. This may occur due to some kidney diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other illnesses.

Another possible cause of polycythemia is where the number of red blood cells is normal but the plasma (the liquid part of blood) is reduced, for instance due to dehydration, or as a consequence of taking some blood pressure medications, or due to obesity, smoking, or excessive alcohol consumption.

This can be corrected if the underlying cause is addressed. Polycythimia may develop as a normal physiological adaptation to the environment, for instance in persons who live in high-altitude areas that have a low oxygen concentration.

Athletes may take advantage of this effect by training at high altitude, though it may not be effective. Use of anabolic steroids and blood doping may also cause polycythemia.

Polycythemia is diagnosed through blood tests. Additional tests depend on the suspected underlying cause of polycythemia. An example is an abdominal ultrasound scan to check the kidneys. Polycythemia can be managed by venesection, which is removal of blood, usually about half a litre of blood, which is done as per the doctor’s instructions.

There are also medications to slow down the production of red blood cells, and medication to prevent blood clots. Any treatable underlying causes should also be attended to. The genetic disorder cannot be cured. Lifestyle changes like maintaining healthy weight, limiting alcohol consumption and cessation of smoking would also be beneficial.

When a child is jumpy and unable to focus,"Dear doctor,My son is nine years old and in Class Four. When he was three, he was diagnosed with ADHD. I thought it would go away as he grew older, but he still has many of the same symptoms that he had. Is there a cure for ADHD?Concerned parent

Dear concerned parent,

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder that is characterised by either inattention, which is difficulty with focusing on something for a period of time; or hyperactivity, that is, having excessive movement that does not suit the occasion; or impulsivity, which is acting quickly, on the moment, without giving the action (and consequences) much thought.

Someone may have one or more of these components, which manifest themselves in different ways in different settings, and may change over time. For example, hyperactivity and impulsiveness in a child may be difficulty sitting still in class, and excessive running around and climbing at home, while for an adult, it may be constant fidgeting and squirming in the seat while in a meeting, and having difficulty waiting in a traffic jam.

ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, especially at the time when children start school (around three years of age). By the time the children reach the teen years, about half of them no longer have ADHD symptoms. However, ADHD can continue into adulthood.

Management for ADHD includes behaviour management strategies, or medication or both. As the child grows older, he/she can also be taught self-management strategies. The support of family and the school community is also vital.

The forgotten foods that can feed Kenya amid climate crisis,"Even as Kenya grapples with the challenge of food insecurity following six failed crop seasons, the country also boasts a diversity of indigenous food varieties.

For most Kenyans, food entails exotic vegetables and cereals. Collard greens, spinach and cabbage constitute the vegetable component of dishes in most Kenyan households.

But did you know that the country has more than 200 different species of indigenous vegetables?

Dr Patrick Maundu is a Kenyan ethnobotanist who has dedicated his entire life to research in the indigenous knowledge of African biodiversity in health and nutrition. He joined the National Museums of Kenya in 1989 and now heads the Kenya Resource Centre For Indigenous Knowledge (Kenrik).

Dr Patrick Maundu, an ethnobotanist at the Kenya Resource Centre for Indigenous Knowledge, explains the importance of Amaranth, also known as Terere, at the National Museum of Kenya on April 11, 2023.

Kenrik was established in 1992 to spearhead the work on Indigenous Food Plants Programme (IFPP), which was under East Africa Herbarium (EAH). The objective was to distribute information on edible wild plants collected for more than 90 years.

The institution now documents, preserves and disseminates indigenous knowledge on traditional food plants, traditional medicinal plants, sacred sites, eco- logical knowledge systems and building structures, says Dr Maundu.

The ethnobotanist believes in food diversification as an approach to boost household and community nutrition and security. He underscores the need to promote these varieties amid the current hunger crisis.

“It is unfortunate that we prioritised eating what our colonisers thought was better at the expense of what many generations before us ate. With the ongoing food shortages, we might have to go back to our roots. Indigenous foods are healthier. They kept our forefathers healthy and alive,” he argues.

Besides their higher nutritional value, Dr Maundu points out that these food crops are more tolerant to changing and unpredictable weather patterns. They also grow in most parts of the country, unlike exotic crops such as maize and wheat which only grow in specific regions.

Food for a hotter planet

Food for a hotter planet

Some parts of these crops are used as medicine, and some cost a pittance compared to other food varieties.

Healthy Nation has compiled a list of some of the traditional vegetables, tubers, cereals and even insects that Kenyans could tap into for better nutrition and health.

Cereals

Cereals are grains used for food and include wheat, maize and rye. These are also cereals indigenous to Kenya and Africa.

Finger millet- Wimbi (Eleusine coracana)

Although it received less attention in the first Green Revolution, finger millet has both a rich nutrient profile and a climate resilience nature. Its seeds provide energy while its calcium content is much higher (almost 10-fold) than any other cereal crop. Additionally, it has better resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses and a long shelf-life of seeds. . It is still an important crop in the Lake Victoria basin, West Pokot, parts of Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet.

Also known as finger millet,Eleusine coracana has both a rich nutrient profile and a climate resilience nature.

Pearl millet- Mawele (Pennisetum glaucum)

Pearl millet is considered a staple food in Africa and India, where it is used to make flour for bread, porridge and other meals. Besides its tolerance to acidity in sandy soils, it can grow in saline soils as well. It is also hardier than maize and sorghum and grows where these cereals cannot grow because of drought.  It is grown in the drier parts of eastern and coastal parts of Kenya.

Sorghum bicolor (great millet)

Commonly known as sorghum, great millet is high in carbohydrates, with 10 per cent protein  and 3.4 per cent fat  content. It also contains calcium and small amounts of iron, vitamin B as well as niacin.  The gluten-free grain is usually ground into a meal that is made into porridge, flatbreads and cakes. It’s found in Eastern and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Pseudo-cereals

These are food crops that are non-grass in nature but are grown for their edible starchy seeds. They are grown for the same purpose as grassy crops.

Tsimboka (Amaranthus cruentus)

Tsimboka is a vegetable in the Luhya language. This variety is one of three Amaranthus species cultivated as a grain source. The fast-growing plant that is topped with clusters of dark pink flowers matures in between four and seven weeks. It can continue to produce for up to 250 days.

The seeds are cooked whole or ground into flour to make highly nutritious cakes. Besides the seeds, the leaves can be cooked as any other vegetable and are rich in vitamins A and C in addition to minerals such as iron and calcium. Found in Western, Eastern and Central region.

Amaranthus cruentus ,popularly known as ‘tsimboka’ in Luhya land, this is one of three Amaranthus species cultivated as a grain source.

Starchy fruits

Banana (Musa spp)

This is a nutritious fruit that grows from various large, herbaceous flowering plants from the genus Musa. Its flesh is soft, rich in starch and its skin (usually easy to peel) can either remain green or turn yellow, red, purple or brown when ripe.

Bananas contain high levels of minerals and phytochemicals (compounds produced by plants, generally to help them resist fungi, bacteria and plant virus infections) including flavonoids, which are beneficial for human nutrition.

Bananas grow in most parts of Kenya, including in counties in the Upper Eastern region, Central and Western Kenya.

Pulse/Legume

Bambara Groundnut, Tsimbande (Vigna subterranean)

Dr Maundu argues that unlike other groundnut varieties in Africa, Bambara groundnuts are an ancient type of Uganda grain legume. The edible nutty part – which can be red, brown, cream or burgundy – is protected by a skin similar to that of peanuts. The seeds ripen underground for between three and four months. When the plants start to wilt, they are ready for harvesting.

Ripe or immature, raw or roasted, the seeds are highly rich in nutrients, including 60 per cent carbohydrate and 20 per cent protein content. These nuts also contain oil and other micronutrients. Notably, this protein food provides more methionine than any other legume.

The nuts are aired in the sun, then steamed or boiled until they are soft enough to eat. The pods can be used as fuel. Found mostly in Western and Central parts of Kenya.

Cowpea- Kunde (Vignia unguiculata)

Owing to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall, the cowpea is an important food crop in most semiarid regions of Africa. Typically, the crop is a climber and has trailing vines that bear edible compound leaves with three leaflets. The white, purple or pale-yellow flowers grow in pairs or in threes at the ends of long stalks. The pods are long and cylindrical and can grow for between 20 and 30 cm.

There are many ways to eat cowpeas. The leaves may be boiled or stir-fried, the green pods may be eaten fresh, steamed, stir-fried or sautéed. The dry seeds are often used in soups, stews, purees or ground into flour or fermented.

In terms of nutritional value cowpeas contain beta-carotene, vitamin E, riboflavin, folic acid, ascorbic acid, calcium, iron, protein while seed protein is relatively rich in lysine. Found in Western, Central, Eastern and parts of Northern Kenya.

Peanut- Njugu Karanga (Arachis hypogea)

The name hypogaea means ‘‘under the earth’’ since the pods containing the edible seeds grow below the ground. Peanuts thrive in warm climates with well-drained, light, sandy or loam soils.

The herbaceous perennial plant produces flowers above the ground but develops the fruit below ground in a process known as geocarpy.

Peanut seeds are edible and are high in protein and other minerals and vitamins. Roots, seed hulls or leaves are used for production of cosmetic products, among them soaps, plastics, wallboard, livestock feed, fertiliser filler and alternative fuels.

The peanut is the most common edible plant part and is consumed either raw or cooked. It is also made into oils, after removal of fats, and ground into flour. Young leaves and tips may be suitable as cooked green vegetables.  They are found in Western, Eastern and Central parts of Kenya.

Pigeon pea- Mbaazi (Cajanus cajan)

The pigeon pea is a woody shrub that reaches only about four centimetres high upon maturity. The plant has deep tap roots, which allow it to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. The edible parts include the seeds, seedpods, leaves and young shoots.

Pigeon pea is also well known for its medicinal benefits with leaves used as treatment for coughs, bronchitis, diarrhoea, haemorrhages, sores, and wounds. Diabetes and sore throats can also be treated using other plant parts of pigeon pea.

The crop is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics. Found in Western and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Climbing bean- Ngelenge, Noe (Phaseolus lanatus)

This is a food crop grown mainly for its seeds and immature seed pods. There are different varieties of the plant that produce a wide range of beans, including the large, white or black ‘‘butter beans’’.

The mature seed is dried and stored for future use. A rich source of protein, noe require thorough cooking to be ready for eating. They can be eaten in a range of ways, including in soups and stews, boiled, fried or baked. Found in Eastern, Western and Central parts of Kenya.

Roots and tubers

These are specialised storage stems of certain starchy seed plants that are typically short and thickened and usually grow below the soil.

Aerial yam (Dioscorea bulbifera)

This tuber crop is also known as ‘‘bitter yam’’ or ‘‘ritugu’’ in the Maragoli. It has aerial, potato-like tubers that grow at the leaf axils. The plant is often cultivated in tropical areas mainly for its edible aerial bulbs. The juice from its roots are used to treat threadworms. Found in Western Kenya.

Taro, Arrow root, Nduma (Colocasia esculenta)

Taro, also called the elephant ear, is a herbaceous plant that grows in marshy areas. Its tuberous root contains vitamin B, iron and phenolic components, according to Dr Maundu.

He adds that the tuber is easily digestible and is often used to prepare baby food. Young taro leaves and stems can be eaten after boiling and are a valuable source of fibre, calcium, phosphorus and vitamins A, B and vitamin C. Found in Central, Western and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Cassava, Muhogo (Manihot esculenta)

This is a tuberous, starchy edible root. Cassava may be eaten raw or cooked. Some parts of the plant are highly toxic that could kill if eaten.

The cassava shrub may grow up to 2.75 m tall. This food plant is also medicinally used to treat hypertension, headache, and other pains, irritable bowel syndrome and fever.

According to the ethnobotanist, the cassava plant contains two different cyanogenic glucosides, linamarin and lotaustralin. Its fresh roots and leaves contain linamarin and hydrocyanic acid at levels that may be toxic. When properly treated through either roasting, soaking or fermentation, the cyanide content is negligible and largely harmless. Found in Western and Coast regions.

African eggplant, Mbilingani (Solanum macrocarpon)

This rare eggplant relative is known as ‘‘lisucha’’ among most Kenyans. All parts of the plant are useful, with its leaves cooked in vegetable soups in the same way as collard greens. The fruit is eaten when cooked with rice in many parts of Africa. Meanwhile, its root is used to treat bronchitis, itch, body aches and asthma. Its seeds treat toothache.

The juice from the vegetables is used in the treatment of gout, rheumatism and angina. In some communities, it is used as a traditional anesthesia during childbirth. Found in Western, Central and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Slender leaf, Mitoo (Crotalaria brevidens)

The slender leaf is a food legume. Its young leaves and shoots are cooked as a vegetable in Kenya and Tanzania. It can be boiled or fried or used as a potherb in stews and soups.

In Africa, the slender leaf is mainly harvested as a vegetable by uprooting the whole plant. The uprooted thinnings may be used as a first harvest and the remaining plants are ready just before flowering after about eight weeks.

In Kenya the leaves are used to cure stomach-ache, swellings and even malaria. The roots are used to treat sore throats and mouth thrush. The shoots of the plant may be used as livestock fodder and seeds fed to poultry, discloses Dr Maundu.

A recent botanical use for the slender leaf is as an agent to promote the germination of Striga, a parasitic plant that is a major problem for maize and millet growers in Western Kenya. Found in Western, Central and Eastern parts of Kenya

Flying termites, Kumbe kumbe

Commonly known as ‘‘amatere’’ or ‘‘amatelle’’ in Western Kenya, these insects have been used for food for centuries. The male and female termites are rich in vitamins A and C. The worker termites, though, have the highest vitamin C content while Queen has the highest vitamin A content.

For centuries, insects have played an important role in human nutrition. It is believed that the first hominids in Africa were eating insects, including termites. They are a good source of protein with high fat content.

Termites are found in most parts of the country.

Termitomyces spp, Obwoba

These are seasonal fruit bodies of edible fungi and a genus of mushrooms whose seasonal edible fructifications are found exclusively in certain regions of Africa and Asia.

Termitomyces only grow in association with termites. Their nests are made of organic matter brought by the insects from feeding on trees.

According to Dr Maundu, the fungus helps the termites to degrade the plant-derived material such as wood, dry grass and leaf litter on which they live.

So far twenty edible species of termitomyces have been recorded from Africa and Asia. Found in Western Kenya as well as in semi-arid regions.

Conkerberry (Carissa spinarum)

Known as ‘‘ochuoga’’ in Luo Land and ‘‘matote’’ elsewhere in Kenya, this is a wild, spiny and evergreen shrub whose fruits are of commercial interest. The plant does well in hotter and drier tropics with deep, fertile soils. It can also thrive in dry, sandy and rocky soils according to the expert.

The red-black sweet fruit ripens to a blue-black colour. It is pleasant to eat raw or cooked in jams. Among communities where this shrub grows, the roots are often put in water gourds to give water a pleasant flavour.

They can also be added to soups and stews for flavour and to disguise the strong aroma of other foods. Found in Eastern Kenya.

Leptadenia hastata, Ekamong’o

This is a climbing shrub that produces many soft stems that become woody at the base. Besides Kenya, it is also found in other tropical African countries such as Senegal, Ethiopia and Uganda.

Its fruits are cone-shaped fruits and release cottony winged seeds as they split open.  The leaves, young shoots and sometimes flowers are cooked and added to soups.

Like many African indigenous plants, the ekamong’o is drought-tolerant and its sap has medicinal benefits. Found in Kenyan bushlands and low-lying seasonally flooded areas.

Spider Plant, Sagaa (Gynandropsis gynandra)

In most Kenyan households, sagaa is a staple. This indigenous leafy vegetable is ranked the second most nutritious among the top four indigenous leafy vegetables consumed as relish. The others are pigweed (Amaranthus blitum), nightshade (Solanum scabrum) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). It is recommended for pregnant and lactating mothers owing to its richness in proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates and minerals.

Moreover, sagaa has medicinal compounds that prevent cancer, asthma, diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases.  The vegetable that is a source of edible oils and is used in manufacture of livestock feed can also be used as an insecticide. Found in Western, Central and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Experts call for urgent action to eliminate trans fats in East Africa,"Health experts have urged East African leaders to take immediate action to eliminate trans fats from food supplies in order to reduce the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

Non-communicable diseases continue to be a significant health concern in the region, with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) being the leading cause of death. Recent studies have shown that trans fats, a type of unsaturated fat commonly found in processed foods, significantly increase the risk of CVDs.

Trans fats, also known as trans fatty acids, are found in foods such as fried and baked goods, shortening, margarine, red meat, and dairy products. They contribute to cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

In Kenya, NCDs were responsible for 39 per cent of deaths in 2020, up from 27 per cent in 2014. More than half of these diseases occur in people aged 40 or younger.

Risk factors include unhealthy diets, tobacco consumption and a lack of exercise. Without robust measures, one in five adults and one in 10 children and teenagers are projected to be obese by December 2023, according to a 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) analysis.

The WHO recommends that trans-fat intake be limited to less than 1 per cent of total energy intake, equivalent to less than 2.2 grammes per day in a 2,000-calorie diet.

Unfortunately, many people in the East African region consume much more than this recommended amount. Trans fats have been shown to increase the risk of CVDs by raising cholesterol levels (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and lowering cholesterol levels (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL).

In addition, trans fats have been linked to inflammation, insulin resistance and other health problems.

""We call on East African leaders to prioritise the regulation of trans fats to address the significant burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, in the region. A harmonised regulation of trans fats has the potential to promote health and save lives. The time for urgent action is now as the longer we wait, the more lives will be lost to these preventable diseases,"" said Celine Awuor, CEO of the International Institute for Legislative Affairs.

NCDs are estimated to cause about 540,000 deaths globally each year. In the East African Community, it is estimated that about 40 per cent of all deaths annually are caused by NCDs.

CVDs account for 25 per cent of all hospital admissions and are costly to manage, resulting in catastrophic spending at the household levels that sink vulnerable patients and their dependents into poverty, according to Dr Lilian Mbau, CEO of the Kenya Cardiac Society.

""Up to 80 per cent of these deaths can be prevented through reduction of risk factors such as unhealthy foods, sedentary lifestyles, smoking and excessive use of alcohol. It is estimated that up to 22 per cent of heart attacks are due to consumption of trans fats.

We urgently need to work towards putting in place policies and legislation to protect our population against exposure to trans fats and other unhealthy foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages borrowing from the successes made to regulate tobacco use,"" added Dr Mbau.

Gideon Ogutu, a nutrition scientist at the International Institute for Legislative Affairs, believes that by implementing a regional regulation on trans fats, the region can take a proactive approach to safeguarding our health and protecting ourselves from the dangers of these detrimental substances.

“It is imperative to recognise the critical importance of regulating trans fats, an abnormal fatty acid that acts in direct contrast to the beneficial properties of healthy fats. Consuming trans fats is not only void of nutritional value but poses a significant threat to our health,” noted Mr Ogutu

Experts are further concerned that Kenya's Food, Drugs, and Chemical Substance Act, Cap 254 (Legal Notice 115 of 2015), which attempts to regulate Industrially Produced Trans Fatty Acids (iTFA), cannot be implemented because it does not mention iTFA limits explicitly.

"Rabies: Symptoms, causes and treatment","Rabies is a viral disease with a very high fatality rate. It is mostly associated with dog bites. It causes progressive inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, all until the patient's demise.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are two types of  rabies disease: furious rabies and paralytic rabies.

“Furious rabies causes fear of water, hyperactivity, and excitable behaviour. In some incidents, the patient might also be afraid of fresh air,” states the WHO.

Death from furious rabies usually occurs after a few days as a result of cardio-respiratory arrest.

Paralytic rabies takes a longer time to affect the patient but it also ends fatally. When a patient has this type of rabies, their muscles will gradually become paralysed. This paralysis will start off at the site of the bite or scratch.

This is followed by a coma that ends in death. The WHO cautions that this form of rabies is very easily misdiagnosed, which regularly results in defective treatment methods.

Burden of disease

In Kenya, the Ministry of Health’s 2014 to 2030 Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Human Rabies estimates that up to 2,000 people die annually due to rabies.

This has seen the Ministry of Health (MOH) rank rabies as one of the top five zoonotic diseases in Kenya.

Globally, 60,000 people die from rabies. Of these, 95 per cent of deaths occur in Africa. Data from the WHO shows that the burden of disease is disproportionally borne by rural poor populations where educational awareness on the rabies disease is low.

An estimated half of cases in rural populations are attributable to children under 15 years of age.

Causes

According to the Ministry of Health (MoH), 98 per cent of all cases of rabies in humans are transmitted by dogs.

“People are usually infected following a bite or scratch by an infected dog. Transmission can also occur when infectious material – usually saliva – comes into direct contact with human mucosa or fresh skin wounds,” MoH says.

“Human-to-human transmission through bite is possible but rare.”

Apart from dogs, it is also possible to get infected after a bite from an infected animal classified as a mammal, for example, a bat.

An infected animal may show certain warning signs. According to the Centre for Disease Control, an infected dog may for instance be very aggressive and make an attempt to bite you.

This dog will also be equally aggressive towards other animals. You may also notice that it is drooling more than normal.

“There are also infected dogs and animals that will look timid and shy and allow you to get close to them before lashing to bite or scratch you,” the CDC cautions.

Other signs you should look out for, CDC says, include a dog that looks sickly, has difficulty swallowing, keeps biting at imaginary things, has trouble moving or looks paralysed, and appears calmer and timid than usual.

Symptoms

According to the CDC, symptoms of rabies in animals are similar to those in people. These symptoms will vary from early signs that are not specific to the rabies disease, followed by acute neurologic symptoms, then death.

The CDC says the early symptoms will tend to be similar to those of the flu. These will include fever, headache, discomfort and general fatigue.

The patient may also experience and unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensation known as paraesthesia at the wound site.

“After the early stage, symptoms of rabies are elevated to cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. This is followed by delirium, abnormal behaviour, hallucinations, fear of water, and insomnia.""

These symptoms can last from two to 10 days after which the disease becomes fatal. “Chances of survival after clinical rabies are very minimal. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease almost always ends with death. Treatment at this stage is mostly supportive,” the CDC states.

According to the WHO, rabies spreads to the central nervous system, and triggers a fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

Treatment

Treatment for rabies is through post-exposure prophylaxis. According to the WHO, this treatment method is designed to stop the rabies virus from getting into your central nervous system.

This treatment should start as soon as the bite has taken place to prevent the onset of symptoms or death.

“Treatment may include extensive washing and local treatment of the bite wound or scratch, administration of potent and effective rabies vaccine that meets the WHO standards, and the administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG),” the WHO states.

Per the CDC, a post-exposure prophylaxis programme will consist of one dose of immune globin and four doses of the rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. “Rabies immune globulin and the first dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure,” cites the CDC.

Prevention

According to the WHO nipping the cause at the source is the best way to prevent rabies. This involves vaccination of your pet against rabies.

This vaccination must be regular as prescribed by a qualified veterinarian. “Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease that can be nipped in the bud through vaccination of dogs. This vaccination will reduce dog-related rabies as well as post dog-bite post-exposure prophylaxis care for the patient,” the WHO states.

If you suspect that your pet has contracted rabies, you should promptly consult a qualified veterinarian to handle it.

“If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal, it is very critical that you consult your physician immediately for post-exposure prophylaxis medical care,” the WHO recommends.

Since children are at an increased risk of getting infected by an infected pet, you should teach them how to protect themselves when around new pets and what to do when attacked. Some of the tips you can share with them include:

Never approach a dog that’s hissing or attempting to peck, scratch or bite.Never go near strange dogs. Always stick with other children when near unfamiliar dogs to avoid accidental scratches, bites or pecks.Never feed a dog with their bare hands.Keep from touching or rattling a dog before it sees or familiarises with them.Always report when scratched or bitten by a dogAlways ask for permission from you or the dog’s guardian if they intend to play with it.Always ask how friendly the dog is.

"Osteoporosis: Symptoms, causes and treatment","Osteoporosis is a medical condition in which bones become weak and brittle. When an individual has osteoporosis, they are at a greater risk for sudden and unexpected bone fractures.

According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the onset of osteoporosis will mean that you will have less bone mass and strength.

“People who come down with osteoporosis are more likely to break bones. This is most often in the hip, forearm, wrist, and spine,” the CDC says. “While bones can get broken as a result of a fall or an accident, osteoporosis weakens them to an extent where the bones break at from alarmingly easy causes. These can include coughing or bumping into something.”

In addition, osteoporosis can cause the bones in the spine to break and begin to collapse. According to the CDC, if this happens, the height of the patient might be affected. The patient may no longer be able to stand straight and may appear to be shorter than they usually are.

“Where the patient has suffered broken hips, they may no longer be able to live independently, and may have a higher mortality rate,” the CDC states.

Osteoporosis is not easy to determine unless the patient receives medical screening and testing. The CDC states that the majority of people who get this condition do not know that they have osteoporosis until after they have broken a bone.

Who is at risk?

Women are at an increased risk of getting osteoporosis over men. According to the CDC, this is because women have lower peak bone mass and generally smaller bones than men.

“Osteoporosis affects women at a higher ratio of 1 in 5 for women aged 50 and over in contrast to a ration of 1 in 20 for men in the same age bracket,” the CDC says. In the majority of cases, women develop osteoporosis one to two years before menopause.

A family history of osteoporosis is also a risk factor. If one of your parents struggles with osteoporosis, there is an elevated risk that you may get this condition as well.

According to the United States’ biomedical research agency National Institute of Health (NIH), low levels of hormones can increase your risk of developing osteoporosis.

“These include low oestrogen in women after menopause, low oestrogen due to delayed or missing periods caused by hormonal disorders and aggressive physical activities in premenopausal women, and low levels of testosterone in men,” cites the NIH.

There are also medical conditions that might set you on a collision path with osteoporosis. These include diabetes, kidney failure, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and a history of breast cancer.

Symptoms

Osteoporosis rarely exhibits symptoms. However, by knowing the risk factors associated with it, you will be better placed to spot signs and symptoms that might point toward developing this condition.

These symptoms include frequent, easy bone fractures, an apparent loss of height, a change in your general posture (for example, you might start bending forward or start stooping), frequent, persistent pain in your lower back, and shortness of breath. According to the CDC, this shortness of breath is caused by compressed disks that make your lungs smaller.

At the onset of this condition, you might notice that the grip of your hand has become very weak and that your gums are receding. This will be the result of your jaws losing bone mass.

Treatment and management

The management and treatment for osteoporosis mainly involves treating and preventing broken bones, and taking medicine to strengthen bones.

Here, the target is to slow or stop bone loss altogether, and prevent possible fractures as much as possible.

According to the NIH, the treatment regime that your doctor will recommend will usually involve medication, a proper, well-balanced diet (nutrition), lifestyle changes, exercises, and prevention of fractures.

If you have osteoporosis or think you might be at risk, there are some steps that you can take to manage this condition or keep it at bay.

According to the CDC, these include taking prescribed and medically approved medications to strengthen your bones, stopping smoking and avoiding alcohol, doing guided exercises to improve your weight abilities, and eating a healthy diet that contains the right amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

Calcium and vitamin D will be critical in helping your bones reach their peak bone mass. “If you do not teat enough calcium, your body will take it from your bones. This may lead to bone loss, bone weakening and bone thinning which trigger osteoporosis,” the NIH cautions.

Per the NIH, products you can consume to boost your calcium intake include low-fat dairy products, turnip greens, broccoli, sardines and salmon, soy milk, orange juice, cereals, and breads.

You should take these together with foods that give you vitamin D that aids in the absorption of calcium from the intestine.

“You get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight, and from certain foods including fatty fish, fish oils, egg yolks, liver, milk and cereals,” states the NIH.

People aged between 18 and 50 years need 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. This daily amount increases to 1,200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70 years old.

If you are taking calcium supplements, you should be careful not to trigger kidney stones. Your total calcium intake from supplements and diet combined should not be more than 2,000 milligrams daily if you are aged 50 years and above.

Eat properly. For instance, excessive dieting or poor protein intake will increase your risk of bone loss and trigger the development of osteoporosis.

Avoid taking alcohol. According to the NIH, regularly drinking more than two alcoholic drinks per day will increase your risk of developing osteoporosis.

It is also recommended that you engage in regular weight exercises help to build up your bone mass. These exercises include walking, jogging, climbing stairs, and dancing. They are exercises that you do on your feet so that your weight is supported by your bones.

You may combine weight-bearing exercises with strength exercises to firm up your muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine, and balance exercises to stabilise yourself from falls.

Rickets: How to identify and prevent your child from getting it,"If you are a parent, there is a good chance you have heard of rickets. However, would you imagine it striking your child?

Rickets is a disease that has been around for centuries and primarily affects young children. The good news is that rickets is preventable and treatable.

Rickets is a skeletal disorder that causes the softening and weakening of bones in children. This condition is primarily driven by a lack of vitamin D, essential for calcium absorption.

Rickets can also be caused by a lack of phosphorus and calcium in the diet or by liver and kidney disorders that prevent the body from properly using vitamin D.

In adults, osteomalacia (softening of bones) is a common condition caused by vitamin D deficiency.

Causes of rickets in children

Limited exposure to sunlight:

Children who spend most of their time indoors may not get enough vitamin D from sunlight.

Poor diet:

A diet that does not include foods that are rich in vitamin D and calcium can lead to rickets. Foods that are high in vitamin D include fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, egg yolk, fortified milk, cereal, and orange juice.

Liver or kidney disorders:

Certain liver and kidney disorders can prevent the body from converting vitamin D into its active form.

Medications:

Some medications, such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids, can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb or use vitamin D.



What are the symptoms of rickets?

There are many signs and symptoms of rickets. Some of the most common include:

1. Poor growth and development, including a failure to reach typical height milestones

2. Bone pain, especially in the legs and spine

3. Muscle weakness

4. Legs appear curved

5. Protruding abdomen or forehead

6. Fractures

7. Rickets can also cause dental problems

8. Oddly shaped breastbone and ribcage

What increases the likelihood of developing rickets?

Age

Rickets can happen to children of any age, but it is more likely to occur in young children. Their bones are still growing, so they need vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus to help them grow strong.

Dark skin

People with dark skin are more likely to develop rickets because they have less vitamin D in their skin. This is because melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, blocks the body's ability to absorb vitamin D from sunlight.

Exclusive breastfeeding

Babies who are exclusively breastfed are also at a higher risk of developing rickets. This is because breast milk does not contain enough vitamin D to meet the needs of a growing baby.

Diet

A diet that is low in calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D can also lead to rickets. This is especially true if a child does not eat foods that are rich in these nutrients or if they do not get enough sunlight.

Family history

Some genes are linked to a higher risk of developing rickets. This means that if someone in your family has rickets, you may be more likely to develop it as well.

Premature birth

Babies who are born prematurely are also at a higher risk of developing rickets. This is because they may not have had enough time in the womb to build up their stores of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus.

Mother's deficiency

If a mother is deficient in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus during pregnancy, her baby may be born with rickets. This is because these nutrients are essential for the development of strong bones.

What are the potential complications of rickets?

If left untreated, rickets can lead to a number of complications. These include:

Bone deformitiesSeizuresHeart failureProlonged disabilityDental problemsDelayed growth and development

How can you prevent rickets?

The best way to prevent rickets is to make sure that you and your children get enough vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus. This can be done by:

Spending time outside in the sun: Exposure to sunlight is the best way to get vitamin D. Just make sure to use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Eating a balanced diet: A diet that includes foods such as fatty fish, fortified milk, and eggs can help ensure that you are getting enough vitamin D. Taking supplements: If you are unable to get enough vitamin D from sunlight and food, you may need to take a supplement. This is especially important for pregnant women and babies who are breastfed exclusively. Fortified infant supplements packed with vitamin D are available for purchase over the counter. Talking to your doctor: If you think you or your child may be at risk for rickets, talk to your doctor.

How to treat rickets

If your child is diagnosed with rickets, their doctor will likely recommend a course of treatment that includes:

Vitamin D supplements: This is the most important part of treatment. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for bone health. Calcium and phosphorus supplements: These may be necessary if your child's diet is lacking in these nutrients. Increased exposure to sunlight: This can help improve vitamin D levels. A balanced diet: A diet that includes foods such as fatty fish, fortified milk, and eggs can help ensure that your child is getting enough vitamin D.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct bone deformities. This is usually only done if the deformities are severe and causing pain or difficulty walking.

Rickets is a condition that can attract stigma and discrimination. This is because it is often seen as a disease of poverty. However, rickets can affect people of all socioeconomic backgrounds.

If you think you or your child may be at risk for rickets, talk to your doctor. They can help you determine if you need to take supplements or make changes to your diet. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for preventing complications.

"Alzheimer’s disease: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment","Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease characterised by the destruction and loss of function of brain cells. The destruction and loss of function of the brain cells leads to dementia i.e., the loss of cognitive function - memory, reasoning, and thinking.

Based on this relationship, Alzheimer's disease is described both as a cause and a type of dementia. As the condition progresses, the loss of cognitive function hinders the person's ability to carry out the simplest tasks of daily living. Advanced Alzheimer's disease also affects the patients' social well-being as they forget the people in their lives and their relationship.

What causes Alzheimer's?

It has been over a century since Alois Alzheimer observed anomalies in the brains of patients with dementia. Since then, scientists have quite a clear understanding of the biochemical changes that happen in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Despite the remarkable progress in understanding the disease, it is still not clear what causes the biochemical changes that lead to the deterioration of the brain and subsequent dementia.

However, some risk factors have been identified as possible contributors to the development of the disease. These include:

Old age

Alzheimer's is most common among people above 65 years of age. However, this does not mean that old age causes Alzheimer's. A lot of old people, even those with dementia, do not have Alzheimer's. Also, many younger people have also been diagnosed with the illness. The prevalence among old people might also be due to the slow progression of the illness.

Heredity or genetic disposition

People with a family member who has Alzheimer's disease are at an increased risk of developing the condition, first, due to genetic make-up. A gene known as apolipoprotein E type 4 (APOE e4) is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. If you inherit this gene from one parent, your chances of developing Alzheimer's disease are quite high. The probability increases almost eight-fold if you inherit the genes from both parents.

Secondly, people from the same family have similar chances of getting Alzheimer's disease because they are exposed to the same factors such as diet, lifestyle, and genetic illnesses. These could either increase or reduce the family's predisposition to develop Alzheimer's disease.

Down syndrome

The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that over 30 per cent of people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease at around 50 years of age. In relation to Alzheimer's, this is a quite a young age. By the age of 60 years, this increases to over 50 per cent. For comparison, in the general population, Alzheimer's average prevalence is at 10 per cent for people above the age of 65.

Head injuries

For years, it has been theorised that head injuries may aggravate the formation of Amyloid Beta (Aβ). The Amyloid Beta protein is associated with the degeneration of the brain leading to Alzheimer's dementia. Studies have shown a strong correlation between head injuries in older people and Alzheimer's. However, scientists still recommended further research because the causality has not been determined conclusively.

Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease

Memory loss

One of the first and most noticeable symptoms of Alzheimer's disease is memory loss. This could manifest as forgetting recent events, conversations, or appointments. This is beyond the normal forgetfulness, and it gets progressively worse. In some cases, patients may even forget their close relatives and friends, and how to do simple tasks such as brushing their teeth or cooking a meal.

Difficulty in completing familiar tasks

As the disease progresses, patients may find it hard to complete familiar tasks. This could be because they forget how to do them or because the task has become too complicated for them. For instance, someone who has been driving for many years may find it hard to follow the rules of the road or operate a vehicle.

It also affects body functions such as swallowing. Swallowing is notable because food and drinks get misdirected to the windpipe instead of the oesophagus. The food particles cause infections, notably pneumonia, which is a major cause of death for people with Alzheimer's.

Problems with language

Patients with Alzheimer's disease may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may also stop in the middle of a sentence and have no idea how to continue or they may repeat themselves. In more advanced stages, patients may have trouble understanding common words and expressions.

Disorientation

Patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose track of time, place, and even people. For instance, they may get up in the middle of the night and wander around aimlessly. This could be because they forget where they are or who the people around them are.

Changes in mood and behaviour

Patients with Alzheimer's disease may experience changes in their mood and behaviour. This could manifest as anxiety, depression, irritability, aggression, or apathy.

Diagnosis of Alzheimer's

There is no one test that can diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Doctors use a combination of physical examinations, medical history, and cognitive tests.

Brain imaging is also done to detect and identify changes in the brain that are associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia in general. The doctor may also carry other tests to rule out other causes of the changes you may have observed.

The doctor may recommend that a close relative or friend accompany the patient so they can provide the behavioural changes that they have observed.

Treatments options for Alzheimer's Disease

There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. For example, cholinesterase inhibitors and Memantine boost inter-cell communications, which is inhibited by Alzheimer’s. This improves the cognitive function of the patient. Further research is still ongoing on medications that can slow down its progression.

If you suspect that your loved one may have Alzheimer's disease, have them assessed by a doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis will help you start treatment and take measures to assist and protect them.

For example, you may need to modify the house arrangements to improve their safety, and to assign a caregiver to help them during episodes of disorientation.

"#HeartHealthDay: Coronary artery disease symptoms, causes, and treatment","Coronary artery disease happens when the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) become narrowed by plaque build-up. Plaque is made up of cholesterol and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the coronary arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.

Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease. It is also the leading cause of death around the world.

There are two forms of coronary artery disease:

1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is divided into unstable angina (chest pain at rest with increasing intensity over time), NSTEMI (a type of heart attack that involves part of the innermost layers of tissue of the heart, and the second layer of tissues of the heart), and STEMI (where the entire heart wall is involved in the heart attack).

ACS describes a range of conditions associated with the sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. ACS happens when the plaque in your coronary arteries rupture or tear open. This can cause a blood clot to form. The blood clot can then block the flow of blood to your heart muscles.

2. Chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) which includes stable angina (chest pain on exertion)

This is a more gradual form of coronary artery disease. CAD happens when the plaque in your coronary arteries slowly builds up over time (which could take years). This can lead to narrowing of the arteries, which can eventually restrict blood flow to your heart.

Coronary artery disease has many causes:

Atherosclerosis: This is the most common cause of coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis happens when plaque builds up in your arteries. Over time, this plaque can harden and narrow your arteries.Smoking increases the risks of coronary artery disease development although it is not a cause in itself.CoronaryvasospasmCoronaryemboli (rare)Arterioscrerosis (an inflammation of the walls of the coronary vessels)

Coronary artery disease symptoms

Angina is chest pain or discomfort when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It's a common symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD). It feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under your breastbone. Angina pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.

The other significant sign of coronary artery disease is a heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction. When plaque build-up becomes severe, it can restrict blood flow and cause a heart attack.

Symptoms associated with a heart attack include chest pain, discomfort in the arms or shoulders, shortness of breath, and nausea. A heart attack can cause permanent damage to your heart or even be fatal.

What increases the risk of coronary artery disease?

Coronary artery disease is a complex condition with many different risk factors. Some of the most common risk factors include:

Physically inactive lifestyle.Family history: If you have a family history of heart disease, you are more likely to develop CAD.Smoking: Smoking is one of the most important risk factors for CAD. Cigarette smoke damages the lining of your arteries and makes plaque more likely to form.High blood pressure: High blood pressure puts extra stress on your heart and can damage your arteries.High cholesterol: High cholesterol can narrow your arteries and increase your risk for heart disease.Diabetes: Diabetes can damage your blood vessels and increase your risk for CAD.Obesity: Obesity increases your risk for CAD, high blood pressure, and diabetes.Stress: Stress can contribute to the development of CAD.Eating junk/ unhealthy foods.

What are the complications of coronary artery disease?

Coronary artery disease can lead to a number of complications, including:

Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to your heart is blocked. This can cause permanent damage to your heart or even be fatal.Angina: Angina is chest pain or discomfort when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.Arrhythmias: Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that can be dangerous.Heart failure: Heart failure occurs when your heart cannot pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.Sudden cardiac death: This is an abrupt, unexpected death from a heart problem.

How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?

Coronary artery disease is usually diagnosed with a combination of tests, including:

Medical history and physical exam: Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms and perform a physical exam.Blood tests can help diagnose CAD by checking for high cholesterol or diabetes.Stress test: A stress test is a type of exercise test that can help diagnose CAD.Electrocardiogram and echocardiogramChest X-rayCoronary angiography and MRI scan

How is coronary artery disease treated?

Treatment for coronary artery disease usually starts with lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, exercising, and eating a healthy diet. Medications and, in some cases, surgery may be needed to treat CAD.

What can you do to prevent coronary artery disease?

Prevention is always better than cure. This is especially true regarding coronary heart disease, as this condition can be debilitating and even life-threatening.

One can prevent coronary heart disease through life changes such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking.

Exercise helps to keep your heart and blood vessels healthy, and a healthy diet will help to lower your cholesterol levels.

If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your heart health. In addition to these lifestyle changes, you should also see your doctor regularly for check-ups.

Separating myths from facts: The truth about vasectomy,"“My wife has been on contraceptives since we started having children. Now that they are adults I have decided to undergo vasectomy and free her from contraceptives.” This is what a man identified as Kamau told the media after undergoing vasectomy at the National Theatre during the 2016 World Vasectomy Day. Kamau can be considered bold and brave because most men in Kenya do not embrace vasectomy.

Data from the Economic Survey 2020 shows that in 2019, 658 men underwent vasectomy, in 2018, the number was 646 while in 2016, the number was 919. This is in contrast to over 2.5 million women who took family planning injections in 2019 alone.

What is it?

Vasectomy, also known as male sterilisation, is a procedure that is performed on ductus deferens. “The ductus deferens, also known as vas deferens, is a thick-walled tube found in the male reproductive system. The tube transports sperm cells from the sperm storage facility known as epididymis,” says Dr. Patrick Hiuhu, a physician. He explains that during a vasectomy, the tubes are cut or sealed to prevent sperm from passing through to the urethra for ejaculation during intercourse.

Advances in medical engineering have made the process easier to conduct. According to Dr. Charles Ochieng, the founder of Family Health Options Kenya, you don’t always have to undergo the scalpel. “The alternative procedure uses spray anaesthesia and takes about ten minutes. The tubes are accessed using equipment known as the ring clamp,” said Dr. Ochieng.

After vasectomy, it takes between one and two weeks for an incision to completely heal. Dr. Janet Brito, a certified sex therapist and co-author of Integrative Sex & Couples Therapy says that vasectomy doesn’t change the feeling or sensation during intimacy. “Most men are afraid that the sensation of orgasm is different after vasectomy. It is not. Neither is the quality or amount of semen,” she says.

Sex and vasectomy

Ejaculating ‘dry air’ is one of the commonly peddled myths about vasectomy and sex. Truth is that vasectomy has no impact on sexual performance, orgasm, sexual desire, ejaculation, and erectile capabilities. However, it can take up to three months after undergoing vasectomy before one can start having unprotected sex. The break is to allow your sperm count to reduce to zero. “After vasectomy, you will get clinical appointments at between 6 to 12 weeks to analyse if there is any sperm left in your semen before you can start engaging in unprotected sex,” says Dr. Hiuhu. This means that in the weeks after undergoing vasectomy, you will need to use protection during intercourse because your semen may still contain sperm that could be potent enough to cause pregnancy.

Is it reversible?

Vasectomy is a reversible mode of family planning. According to urologist Dr. Sarah Vij, the success rate of a vasectomy reversal will mainly depend on the time that has elapsed since the procedure was done. Where a reversal procedure is done within the first ten years, chances of success are as high as 95 percent. From 15 years and above, the rate of success declines significantly.

Does vasectomy cause prostate cancer?

According to medical research of 42,000 men aged 40 and above who had undergone vasectomy in the United States, there is no link between vasectomy and the onset of fatal prostate cancer. The result of this medical research by the American Cancer Society was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2016. The research also found that men who undergo vasectomy do not have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. If they get prostate cancer, they are not more likely to die from it than men who don’t undergo vasectomy. Men who’d want to lower their risk of fatal prostate cancer need to maintain a healthy weight and quit smoking, which is associated with a high risk of fatal prostate cancer,” said Dr. Eric Jacobs, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society who led this research.

"Men are avoiding the doctor, can that be changed?","Studies show that, compared to women, men are less likely to visit a doctor for regular checkups, or when something is not right.

Healthcare workers report having to send family members to persuade their male relatives to visit the hospital.

What could be behind men’s poor health-seeking behavior?

Can anything be done to convince them that a visit to the doctor is good for them?

Why they choose to stay away

When asked why they avoid hospitals and doctors in general, most men say they believe they will get better on their own. This can be interpreted as either overblown confidence in themselves or downplaying the gravity of a possible illness. Experts theorise this as the superhero syndrome at play. Most men consider falling ill a sign of vulnerability and weakness. They believe people will perceive them as weak if they visit a doctor.

Some doctors believe men stay away from hospitals because of the fear of bad news. A typical man would rather take painkillers for life for migraine than being informed that they have a tumor.

Men also fear “shameful feedback” about sensitive issues such as fertility and erectile dysfunction. This makes many opt to solve the problem on their own by taking supplements or even blaming their partners for their woes.

Finally, it is also possible that men are afraid of some diagnostic and treatment procedures. For example, colonoscopy and tests for prostrate can be quite uncomfortable.

The cost of avoiding doctors

Many lifestyle diseases have ‘silent symptoms’ which can only be detected through regular checkups. Therefore, by avoiding doctors, men rob themselves of the chance of an early diagnosis.

Late diagnosis means an illness has advanced, sometimes irreversibly or the patient may have to undergo expensive and intensive treatments.

This mentality could also harm dependents who are in the care of men. A man who can’t book checkup appointments for himself is unlikely to make such arrangements for others.

These men may also expect their sons and other male relatives to toughen up and dissuade them from going to the hospital often.

Getting men to see the doctor

Here are some suggestions:

Offer discounts for people who go for checkups with their partners

Many men have reported going to a doctor just to get their partners to stop nagging. With such an incentive, many women will persuade their partners to see a doctor.

Sensitize men on need for checkups

Some researchers have suggested that women go for checkups more often because they understand their health better than men. Campaigns to sensitize men on the need for checkups could improve their perception of doctor visits.

Male medical personnel for reluctant patients

Men who consider going to the doctor as emasculating are also unlikely to disclose all their medical information. However, they are usually open to older male doctors because they perceive them as qualified and experienced.

Final words

Although millennial men have shown more enthusiasm towards seeking medical attention, compared to men of older generations, there is still a gap that calls for efforts towards changing men’s mindsets about seeking healthcare.

Getting pregnant after 40 – what you should know,"After 40, the chances of conceiving decrease significantly.

However, with tailored advice and tips, conceiving after 40 is not impossible.

What to expect

Being pregnant at an older age can take a toll on your body in different ways.  Body aches and pains are common side-effects of being pregnant.

A successful pregnancy at this age comes with increased risks of certain medical conditions. Consult your doctor to see if you’re susceptible to any medical challenges.

Psychologically, prepare for change. For example, when many women are pregnant at an older age, they feel exhausted. Mental stability is important so always take care of your mental health.

Problems you may encounter

Diminished ovarian reserve: This is a condition in which the ovary loses its normal reproductive potential, leading to decreased chances of getting pregnant because of reduced fertility.Treatment challenges: Infertility treatments are more expensive and less effective as a woman gets older. This can lead to emotional stress, which can contribute to pregnancy complications.Increased risk of miscarriage: The risk of miscarriage is relatively higher with age. This is because when a low-quality egg is produced and fertilized, it is difficult for the embryo to develop well, causing miscarriage.

Increasing your chances of conception

Older women can get pregnant naturally. It may just take a little more time. However, some practices can help improve fertility and the chances of a successful pregnancy.

Prenatal exercises will increase your chances of carrying a baby to term. Exercising also eases the pain of childbirth.Consume a healthy diet with plenty of protein. Additionally, take prenatal vitamins to prepare for pregnancy.Use Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). The most common procedure of ART is IVF. Using In vitro fertilization (IVF), eggs are removed from the ovaries and mixed with sperm outside the body. Seek professional advice before undergoing this procedure.Practice a healthy lifestyle, including eating well, exercising, and limiting alcohol intake. Alcohol is a common cause of infertility.Keep stress levels down. Cortisol, a stress hormone, can disrupt the coordination of the brain and the ovaries, which affects ovulation.Use natural supplements. Consult an expert for advice on what supplements will work for your specific context.

Benefits of getting pregnant after 40

1. Financial stability

Generally, the older you are, the more stable your finances become. Being pregnant at an older age gives you time to save money on childcare, a mortgage, or other necessary expenses.

2. Emotional stability

Pregnancy can cause unexpected emotional changes and mood swings. However, older women can control their emotions better than younger women.

3. Disciplined children

Children raised by older parents tend to do well academically and have good discipline. Studies have also shown that children raised by older parents are more likely to be successful.

"I'm unable to have children, so my husband wants another wife","Q: I have been married for the last six years. My husband and I do not have children. I have tried every intervention, including medical. I feel so devastated by this. Some months ago my husband told me that he really wants children and the only option is to marry another wife. He assured me of his love even after his second union. I feel more pain now. I love him and I really want him happy. If children will add to his happiness I will be happy too. He has a right to marry because it is within the law. Now how do I deal with this? Please help me.

-----

A: Understandably, this is a very difficult scenario that you are facing. There’s the fact that you cannot bear children – and now you have the added pain of a potential second wife. I empathise with you. Just as he said, he has the right to do so, but at the same time, you know this will cause you great pain. So, it is important to note that the feelings you are having while thinking about his options are perfectly normal.

If he does chose to go ahead with this, at least you are clear on his reasons why: it is not because he loves you any less or values you any less, but because of his natural desire to have children. This reasoning will help you not be hard on yourself, thinking that you have done something wrong or that you are inadequate for him.

You now need a candid conversation about the way forward once he gets his new love. Let him know that he still has the same obligations to take care of you and love you in the way he always has. He is obliged to treat you both equally. So, even though you might be sharing your time, he must still give you the same level of attention and affection.

From your letter, your husband clearly understands that it would be difficult for you and that must be the reason why he respected you enough to ask you about it first and involve you rather than just going about it behind your back. You can take this as a positive sign that he loves and cares for you very much. My best wishes.

Can FGM be a personal choice?,"Rose, a farmer from the outskirts of Nairobi, came to the sexology clinic to enquire if she could be circumcised. Female circumcision, also called female genital mutilation (FGM) or female genital cutting (FGC), is outlawed in Kenya.

“There is a court case going on where the petitioner wants adult women allowed their rights to decide whether to get circumcised or not in registered hospitals,” she explained. “I just want to know if you will circumcise me once the case goes through.” Rose was referring to a court case in which a female doctor has challenged the Kenya anti-FGM law.

I reclined in my seat, agape. It was the strangest request I had received in many days. I composed myself and took to understanding my patient’s request through a detailed medical history. Rose was 35 years old. She was married and had four children. She did not have any medical or sexual problem.

“The parents of my husband have never fully accepted me, though” she explained. “They value female circumcision and know that I am not circumcised.” Rose was afraid her father-in-law would disinherit her husband because of this.

I asked why female circumcision was such a big deal in this family. According to Rose, an uncircumcised woman was considered uncultured. Such a woman was considered a sexual disaster, tempting men to sleep with her. “There have been rumours that most likely, the children I have do not belong to one man!” Rose exclaimed. “Apparently, in my sexual craziness I could have conceived with other men.”

Rose was always left out of important family meetings because discussions were said to be for ‘mature’ women; Rose was classified as a girl, not a woman. Her husband had supported her all along, but of late he seemed to be warming up to the idea of marrying a second circumcised woman to reduce pressure from his father.

I concluded that Rose’s issue was a case of an oppressed, ostracised and stigmatised person accepting her status and working towards being integrated into a society that had rejected her. I realised that many women could also be in this state. Such women also fear for their daughters. Such pressures put three million girls at risk of undergoing FGM every year.

The ethical and moral question is whether communities and families should peg a woman’s status on the cut. “Well, that is what our community wants,” Rose insisted, “and if you allow me to do it then I will bring my daughters too because we all have to conform.”

And that is the tragedy. The moment you give leeway for FGM to be practiced legally on adults you open a floodgate for perpetuating its harmful aspects. Being a traditional and cultural practice, it has a meaning that goes with a package of beliefs and practices. In communities that allow FGM, it defines a woman’s status. It also defines a woman’s sexual rights and disables her from making sexual choices. It is a package that defines what one has to accept and live with on making important choices such as marriage; you get circumcised then get married. Many children who have undergone FGM have dropped out of school for early marriages.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also dispelled the myth that FGM done in health facilities is safe. Irrespective of where it is done, WHO asserts that FGM causes pain, bleeding, infection, infertility, painful sex and many other complications including death. From a medical perspective therefore, FGM is an unprofessional practise which should result in disciplinary action.

“What? So you mean you will not do the cut on me?” Rose frowned. I nodded. What is urgently needed is conversations at community level, with families, on the need to open space for the girl child to achieve her potential and allow women to enjoy their rights. Reversing the gains already made in women’s rights by re-introducing practices such as FGM is defeatist and against the international development agenda.

“Okay doctor, I suggest you tell that to my father in law,” Rose said, standing to leave.

“I will write about it in my newspaper column. Buy the newspaper and give it to him,” I replied, to which she nodded, hurrying out of the consultation room.

What should I do to make my wife let me access her phone?,"Q: I have been married for nine years. My main problem is my wife’s phone, which she won’t let me access. She has locked it with a password, which I have tried to ask her to unlock, but she won’t. Is she hiding something? I have a password on my phone because of the sensitive work documents I have in it – and as you know, the husband is the head of the home. She is my wife; she shouldn’t have that password in the first place. What should I do to make her let me have access to her phone? We had an argument over this and it is creating distance between us.

-----

A: From the way you phrase yourself, one can tell that there are issues in this marriage beyond the password problem. You think it is okay to protect your phone because you are the man of the house and your wife needn’t know your business; but when your wife does the same you accuse her of hiding things and demand access because you are the husband? Why would you lock yours and want her to open hers? We all get back what we give.

Please know that marriage feels safest when there is full transparency from both partners. True intimacy is built on a shared trust and respect that requires vulnerability. Also remember that you are equal partners in your marriage, and that you are both human beings who feel the same pain and frustrations.

You say that she may be hiding information from you. This might be true – but she may be innocent and simply locking her phone because you are locking yours. Either way, this is an issue that you both need to handle as it is creating a lot of mistrust, and no marriage that can survive a lack of trust. You need to be open and honest in your communication. It is therefore key you have a talk and express to her how this affects your feelings of safety and trust in the relationship.

While you may not know what she is doing on her phone, you do know that she is guarding a part of her life from you, which creates the lack of trust. As you discuss, I suggest that you talk with her clearly about your need to feel safely connected to her in the union.

Please do not focus on WHAT she may be hiding, as that speculation will only create more distance between you. In case she tells you that she locks her phone because you also do the same, then you either leave your phone locked and drop the issue forever, or let her have access to yours as well. My best wishes.

Erectile dysfunction can be linked to serious health problems,"The first time Alice came to the sexology clinic, she did not want to see a doctor. She asked at the reception if she could buy Viagra. The receptionist advised her to talk to the doctor but she refused and walked away. A week later she was back. This time round she agreed to see me.

“I know what am looking for,” she explained. “I have not had sex with my husband for two years because he can’t stand to the occasion. I just want Viagra to sort that out. I nodded understandingly, looking for an avenue to strike a rapport before we could go into details of Viagra and ED.

Alice was 48 years old. She was a journalist married to James, a 55-year-old high school teacher. The couple had been married for 19 years and had three children, the youngest being 12 years old. They had had a blissful marital life till James’ erections started dwindling. Because he was embarrassed, he opted to avoid sex altogether.

Understanding erectile dysfunction | Your World

Alice was unhappy with his decision. She tried to get him to go for treatment but he would hear nothing of that. This is why she wanted Viagra. Unfortunately for a problem as important as ED, a complete medical evaluation has to be made. I had a long chat with Alice after which I decided to talk to her husband on phone. James was difficult to convince.

“You have actually teamed up with my wife to talk about my private life?!” he snapped. After a lot of patience and persuasion from my end, he agreed to visit the clinic.

I did not hear from the couple for another three months, until a giant of a man walked into the clinic one morning and told me that he was James. He was not just tall, but also wide. After asking me a number of questions about my clinic, James finally opened up about how his erections had faded over time and his subsequent fight with his wife. He thought it was demeaning for a man to seek care for such problems.

On examining him, I found James to be obese. His weight was 150 kg. The right weight for his height was supposed to be 70 to 85 kg. His blood pressure was high. I ordered tests to assess his hormones, cholesterol and blood sugar. We agreed to meet in three days to review the results. Meanwhile, I prescribed anti-hypertensives.

The next day I received a call from Alice. She was weeping. James was no more. He had developed chest pains in the night and was rushed to hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. I followed up with the medical team in the hospital to understand the cause of death; he had had a heart attack.

Two days after James died I received the results of tests I had ordered. He had high cholesterol as well as sugar. James’s case showed that ED can be a symptom of serious health problems. In his case, obesity and undiagnosed high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar were the real problems; ED was the symptom. These abnormal changes in the body are a result of sedentary lifestyles. The changes ultimately result in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) epitomised by heart attack and stroke.

CVDs kill close to 18 million people every year worldwide. Most of these deaths happen in developing countries. Another big number of people live with varying forms of disability from the effects of these diseases.

In sexual medicine, ED has been identified as one of the warning sign of CVDs. Anybody who suffers ED should seek medical help and should be screened to ensure that they are not at risk of sudden death.

Alice came to the clinic after James was buried. She wanted to understand more. “Do you think I stressed him so much that his heart failed?” she asked, tears welling up her eyes.

I explained that she was right to insist he seeks medical attention. However James took too long to do so and just when we were about to diagnose his problem, he passed on. Alice broke down and cried uncontrollably. Overcome by emotion, she walked out of the clinic. She was still in the early stages of mourning and I realised my explanation only caused her more pain.

 ,"How does it feel to win Sh208 million? Can you imagine it? What do you do first?

Do you change your lifestyle immediately? Do you let the money stay in the bank for a day, a week, or a month?

What would you do? Is this even real? To the six million gamblers who placed their bets daily at the height of the betting craze in Kenya, the weekly Jackpot was the most important show.

A win comes with everything. Glamour. Publicity. Money. This is every punter’s dreamland.

The stories were catchy, the photos charming and the dummy cheques mouthwatering. This was gambling on steroids.

Money was falling from the trees and Kenyans were scrambling for the windfall, placing bet after bet after bet.

For the men and women behind the curtains at swanky offices, this was not betting; this was manna.

Mega Jackpot winners

The question of winners – especially winners of big money – is a dicey one.

In its best days, SportPesa had 118 Jackpot winners and six Mega Jackpot winners, who walked home with between Sh111 million and Sh230 million.

Then there are some like Albert (no second name), who is listed as having won Sh32.4 million in 2016 but never showed up to collect his prize.

There were also suspicious winners, including girlfriends of employees, who raised a storm in the board.

The biggest concern came through the firm’s local subsidiary, Bradley, whose main brand was the Pambazuka lottery.

Bradley was launched in May 2016 and, by the time it closed shop slightly less than two years later, the firm had incurred more than Sh1.5 billion ($15 million) losses, which were written off in the books of Pevans in its 2018 accounts.

An insider, however, says unethical practices were the main reason for its closure.

For example, the spouse or fiancée of one of the employees in the IT department, which was the heart of its operations, on November 1, 2017 won a Sh20 million lottery, making her one of the first people to win.

Sh208 million jackpot winner

However, the firm’s CEO Paul Kinuthia, on learning of this win, became suspicious and had the employee immediately arrested.

However, before charging him in court, the company piled pressure on Mr Kinuthia to release the employee to avert a hostile reporting crisis. The money was paid.

Earlier, in July 2017, a man named John Friendrich had claimed that he had won a Sh109 million Jackpot and the media went to town with the story.

The money was, however, not forthcoming, so he sued SportPesa and Bradley. It is not clear what became of the case.

Then there was Mr Cosmas Korir, a Sh208 million jackpot winner.

A Country of Gamblers tracked him down to his Bomet and Eldoret homes.

Mr Korir, who is preparing to run in the 2022 General Election, tells us how he spent his millions.

How I spent the Sh208 million

Korir told the Nation when we visited him at his Bomet home that he got the entire Sh208,765,000 directly into his account. He says the money hit his account as soon as he left Sportpesa offices at Chancery House in Nairobi.

The first thing he wanted was a new car. This saw him buy a Toyota Land Cruiser V8 for Sh12 million. Then he had his two betting friends whom he gave Sh5 million each, adding up to Sh10 million. These friends he says were there with him from the very beginning when he was struggling to make ends meet and helped him to place the winning bet.

He then spent Sh2 million to complete his rural house in Bomet that had stalled having run out of cash. He also cleared what was left of a Sh3.5million loan he had taken to construct his house.

Korir then moved to Eldoret where he bought a flat to settle his family, where they are still living to date. At this time, there were too many unsolicited investment advice from friends and well-wishers and he decided to lock Sh130 million in a fixed deposit account to think and process what he needed to do. After about six months, Korir decided to go into real estate where he bought two flats in Kitengela.

He first bought an entire flat of 86 rooms in Kitengela, named it Double KK. This cost him about Sh50 million and he says if fully occupied, it has a monthly rental income of Sh570,000. But he says the challenges of the real estate sector make it difficult to have full occupancy at any given time and they fetch less.

Seeing how lucrative the first flat was, bringing him about Sh400,000 on a good month, he went back to Kitengela and bought a second Flat. This was a mix of 25 one bedroomed houses and 71 bedsitters, bringing it to a total of 96 rooms.

This second flat cost him Sh65 million and it has an estimated rental income when complete and fully occupied of Sh820,000 per month. He has also invested in machinery, and bought several parcels of land in Eldoret. He does not believe any of the other winners were fake and remains a big Sportpesa ambassador to date.

Being a politician, he is currently building a mansion. Unlike the other winners, Cosmas appears to have gotten the best side of everything. He won big by placing the smallest bet, but also most importantly, he had support from the company and friends on how to spend the money so that he doesn't end up destitute.

To get more details on this, listen to the fourth episode of A Country of Gamblers podcast.

Prepare financially for your newborn with these tips,"While the arrival of a newborn baby is exciting for many families, the bundle of joy comes with additional financial responsibilities.

Planning for your child's needs such as education and healthcare can seem daunting. Luckily, there are ways to prepare financially before the birth of your baby.

Have an emergency fund

You may have already purchased a crib and clothes for your new arrival. But, there are many other things you'll need before and after the baby arrives.

Save up in an emergency fund in order to have a cushion in case unforeseen issues arise while you're pregnant or during delivery.

Life insurance

This is an excellent time to invest in life insurance for yourself and your children. Ensure your children have some form of financial protection in case something happens to you, especially when they are still minors.

Prepare a will

It is important to prepare a will before the baby arrives. A will prevents any confusion that would arise among family members should anything happen to you.

If you have a will already, adjust it to include your newborn baby. For instance, most parents want their property inherited by their kids. You can assign a guardian to take care of the children and the assets until they reach the legal age.

Acquire a health insurance plan

Everyone has a personal financial pulse. It is advisable to check various insurance policies to see which suits your budget while catering to your needs.

The benefit of getting health insurance before the baby arrives is that you will be covered for prenatal care and delivery.

You could also choose a plan which includes pediatrician visits, prescriptions, dental care, and even vision services. The premiums might increase after childbirth but it is worth paying the increased fee because of the added advantages.

Organize your finances

Many parents-to-be worry about their personal finances and whether they'll be able to afford all their baby's needs.

A good idea is to create a budget with realistic estimates.

Sort out assets and liabilities. Assets include cash at hand, savings, property like real estate, investments such as stocks. Liabilities include loans, monthly bills, and expenses.

Shop early for the baby

Early shopping will help you stick to your budget. Having a variety to choose from and purchasing products at a discount are a few of the benefits of shopping early.

You can also ask for advice from people who have had children before, on where to get the best bargains.

Nanny hunting

If you are planning to work or look for a job during and after pregnancy, it is important that the nanny has all necessary qualifications such as experience with babies. It is also wise to ask for copies of their personal identification documents.

Looking for a nanny early ensures that you have enough time to do a thorough search and get one within your budget.

In conclusion

Financially preparing for a baby is imperative to the child's well-being and your peace of mind.

The family should have insurance and a clear budget before baby arrives to ensure they are able to provide for the child without going into debt or taking on too much guilt as parents.

On the edge: What triggers persistent genital arousal disorder?,"Rose was in distress when she walked into my consultation room. She introduced herself then went quiet for about five minutes. To break the ice, I asked how I could help her. She raised her head, looked me straight in the eye, and then looked down again. Then, all of a sudden, she started crying uncontrollably. I gave her time to cool down. Sex problems are difficult. Very many people suffer quietly and lack the strength to go for treatment. I therefore congratulated Rose for taking the first step and reassured her that I would do my best to help, whatever it was.

“Sorry, I have just had orgasm and was unable to keep talking. It made me feel horrible that it happened right here in front of you,” she explained. Rose was 35 and a single mother of two. She was a lawyer running her private law firm in the middle of town. “Give me medicine to reduce my libido,” she pleaded. “I am unable to concentrate on my work. I feel like my genitals are in total control of my life.”

After evaluating Rose’s situation, I concluded that she did not have high libido. High libido is synonymous with excessive desire for sex. It is characterised by sex fantasies and a general desire for the act. Sexual experiences resulting from high libido are enjoyable. On the other hand, Rose was always on edge, feeling like she would have orgasm any time.

I made a diagnosis of persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD). PGAD is basically an abnormality of the nerve supply to the genitals. The nerves that cause sexual stimulation fire signals without control. This activity has no connection to the usual sex cycle, which is normally linked to intimacy and starts with foreplay.

Symptoms include abnormal excitement which makes one feel as if they are going to climax any time. The disorder almost exclusively affects women. On the rare occasion that a man is affected, they suffer priapism – a non-resolving erection of the penis.

Affected women may have sex with the hope of relieving the feeling but it may not go away. A number of cases present to the clinic for masturbating too much, feeling guilty and thinking that masturbation is the cause rather than the effect of their medical problem.

There are triggers which exacerbate it PGAD such as tight underpants, tampons, sitting down, driving on a rough road or riding a bicycle. Anything that exerts pressure or causes vibration around the genitals worsens the condition.

Affected individuals feel helpless, frustrated and depressed, and may even attempt suicide. They are unable to cope with their body demands as well as demands of work or in social cycles. They isolate themselves, feel stigmatised and become loners, eventually sliding into depression.

“But surely doctor what brings such an unfair condition?” Rose lamented.

The abnormal nerve signals to the genitals can result from problems with the brain or spinal cord. They can also result from local nerve or blood system problems. In some cases, the condition is a side effect of some medicines. In other cases it is a consequence of surgical treatment in the genital areas, interfering with nerve or blood functions to the genitals. In other words, PGAD is not to be taken lightly. Affected people must undergo thorough medical tests to determine the cause. Sometimes, though, the cause is not easy to find.

The cause of Rose’s case was unclear. She was put on a combination of treatment targeting the highly likely causes. It took months before some relief was realised. Two years later today, at least Rose is able to function among her peers and in her social space. However she is still on medication and this will not change unless signs clearly show that she is fully recovered.

Case Number Zero - An introduction,"

Bogonko Bosire went missing in September 2013. He disappeared as the International Criminal Court cases against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy, William Ruto, were hitting a crescendo.

This is the story of who he was, and where his friends think he may be.

 ,"Saturday, July 2, 2016. Around 10pm in Nairobi. A fresh university graduate, Paul Midega, sat down to watch the last football match of his life.

This was the night the Euro Cup semi-final between Italy and Germany was played. It was a big game pitting Europe’s giants in football.

But thousands of kilometres away here in Nairobi, young Midega was doing more than just watching this match.

Midega had taken out a huge bet of Sh80,000 on this game. The money was not his.

He had diverted funds given to him by his elder brother to settle household bills. But Midega was sure he would return the money before anyone noticed it was gone. He was wrong.

His plan was simple. Split the Sh80,000 into two equal bets. Then place a bet on either side of the match. He placed Sh40,000 on a Germany win and staked Sh40,000 on an Italy win.

Like most punters, he did not put all his eggs in one basket. Before placing the bet of his life, the fresh Bachelor of Commerce graduate had carefully studied the odds at play.

In the very least, he was sure of making a profit of Sh12,000. If Germany won, Midega would make a total of Sh92,000.

Sh80,000

And if Italy beat the favourites of this match, he would end up with Sh152,000.

He pictured himself refunding his brother the Sh80,000 and still left with a Sh72,000 windfall.

So, the game started. The first half must have been tense. None of the teams scored. By half time, Midega was already very anxious because he needed one team to win. One team had to win.

So, the second half of the game started. His first smile came in the 65th minute, when Germany scored.

At this time, he was counting his windfall already. He was in the money until defender Jerome Boateng handled the ball.

This ended in a penalty. With Italy equalising, Midega had a painful final 12 minutes of the game.

He had forgotten one important rule of the betting world. The house always wins.

Lost, dejected, hopeless, and deep in debt, Midega held his life in his hands.

The city had become untenable. So, he took a bus back home to his ancestral home in Migori.

He alighted in Migori town, and took a boda boda to his rural Ondome village.

Somewhere on this last leg of his journey, he stopped, bought a rope with the Sh20 left in his pocket and completed his journey on foot.

His life was in turmoil. He was once again in a deep financial crisis and was not ready to face his parents for a bailout.

He found a spot to wait for dusk, where he sat down and considered his options.

It took a loss of Sh80,000, to bet away his life. His death was reported on July 6 when the quiet Ondome village woke up to the tragic news.

A mango tree. A suicide note. Pain. He was not the first one and not the last.

More than a year after SportPesa was shut down, another young man, Meshack Bwisa, betting on several platforms, lost more than Sh70,000 in one night.

He switched off his phone, locked himself inside his house in Kakamega, swallowed a pill, lit a jiko, and slept, never to wake up.

To the six million gamblers that placed their bets daily at the height of the betting craze in Kenya, winning the jackpot was the ultimate prize.

Cosmas Korir was not the only big winner of jackpots in Kenya. His Sh208 million win in 2018 was also not the biggest. Before him, there had been Samuel Abisai, who pocketed Sh221 million.

But the luckiest jackpot winner in Kenya's betting history is Gordon Ogada.

Ogada, a Kibera resident then, won a Sh230 million jackpot in 2018 after he correctly predicted the outcome of 17 matches.

Six mega jackpot winners

To date there are six mega jackpot winners in the history of SportPesa who were lucky winners of between Sh111 million and Sh230 million.

These were not all the winners. Those who did not get the mega jackpot had midweek jackpots to fight for. In total, there were 118 punters who won between Sh5 million and Sh81 million in these midweek jackpots. But these wins were not everyone’s story.

The wins were sweet. The losses were painful. Many homes were transformed by the millions. Many hearts were broken.

There were more than 500,000 youth who were blacklisted by the Credit Reference Bureau, having borrowed mobile loans, placed their bets and lost.

Then there were addictions, debt and suicides. These were the stories that went largely unreported.

 ,"Ronald Karauri, a jovial, flashy former pilot at Kenya Airways, never saw himself as the man who would fly SportPesa from a small struggling company into East Africa’s largest betting firm.

Karauri needs no introduction to Kenyans after his public role as the SportPesa CEO.

A passionate poker player and son of a politician, Karauri first met Guerassim Nikolov, the controversial and principal SportPesa founder, at a poker table on the first floor of the dimly lit Finix Casino in Hurlingham, Nairobi in 2014.

His meeting with the Bulgarian that night was by sheer chance. The two poker lovers clicked from the word go as they faced off in a competitive poker match at the Casino in Hurlingham.

The strangers quickly developed a bond and their camaraderie grew stronger as they sprang from one poker game to the next.

Karauri believes poker, his favourite pastime, has a way of revealing a person’s true character. And on this table, he knew he could trust Nikolov.

“With Poker, there are different hands, different cards. You place bets then the best hand wins. Sometimes, you laugh at each other, but at the end of the day, the best hand wins,” Karauri told the Nation in an extensive interview to get the inside story of the embattled company.

From here, they would meet a few more times before firming up the business decision to run a betting company together.

Sportpesa podcast - Episode 3: Enter the captain

Sportpesa podcast - Episode 3: Enter the captain

Biggest betting firm in East Africa

In January 2015, Karauri would officially join SportPesa.

The decision would pay off four years later, after their fortunes rose following the company’s whirlwind success to become the biggest betting firm in East Africa. By December 2018, SportPesa was making revenues of Sh150 billion annually.

He has fond memories of his Bulgarian partners and his first meeting with them.

“I wish you could meet them. There is a perception of Eastern Europeans, Nigerians and all that, but they are good people. There is something about poker. It brings out people's true character and personality,” he explains.

Karauri and his team of Bulgarian shareholders have, for months, kept mum on the developments at the firm since they became a target of an unrelenting government crackdown that has ended up with them losing their betting licence in two companies -- Pevans East Africa and last month, Milestone.

In his first exclusive media interview, Karauri swiftly dismisses claims that some of his Bulgarian partners are criminals and rubbishes allegations that he was dealing with the Mafia.

“Gero (Guerassim Nikolov) is a gentleman. I have known him for many years and all of that time he was here, he was married to a lady here in Kenya and they have two children,” he says.

Nikolov is the man who was running SportPesa as CEO before Karauri came on board and he passed the baton to him.

“I have never seen a very hardworking man like Gero, because taking time off for him was difficult, it is like he can’t do it. We are the ones who have propelled the company to where it is,” the SportPesa boss says as he settles in his seat.

Would-be engineer turned pilot

As fate would have it, Karauri also first met former MP Dick Wathika in 2014, in the same casino where he met the Bulgarians. It is also in that casino where Wathika would collapse one year later, on December 19, 2015, and be rushed to Karen Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

When he met them, Karauri realised that Nikolov and Wathika were already bosom buddies, having shared a controversial past in betting for more than a decade.

“My history with Wathika starts at the casino while playing poker. Remember the time I met Gero, is also when I met Wathika,” he says.

At the time, he did not know Wathika, other than what he had read about him in the media.

Seated in his office, Karauri’s demeanour does not betray the big fight from within that is tearing apart the giant company.

Karauri is a pleasant host. If he is arrogant or proud as his critics describe him, then he is very good at hiding it at our meeting. Those who love him admire him for his taste in fine things, his lavish lifestyle and his disarming honesty.

He has a quick wit, is likable and there is no doubt that he is media savvy. His hearty laughter reverberates through the boardroom.

He is sharp, a little nervous, but has all the important numbers at his fingertips. In any case, he is a former pilot who scored top grades at Mang’u High School.

He would have been a mechanical engineer had he not dropped out of engineering school at the University of Nairobi in his third year to take up an offer as a graduate pilot trainee at Kenya Airways (KQ).

Became rich and famous

He now sits, almost helpless as the vicious boardroom fight among billionaire investors at the company spreads like a cancer, destroying everything in its wake.

Karauri maintains that Kenyans are very far from understanding what really hit the company, and is quick to absolve the company of all accusations levelled against it -- from tax fraud and money laundering to profit shifting. He is confident that one day the courts will vindicate him and the company will have back its glory.

But betting was nowhere in his horizon, until he met the Bulgarians.

When the company was sponsoring the Kenya Football League, boxing championships, English premier league teams and Formula One, he was seen handing out trophies to the teams.

To some, he was Kenya’s celebrity CEO. In Kenya he quickly became famous because of the sheer amount of money SportPesa put in advertising and, by extension, in the media.

He seemed to enjoy this fame and missed no opportunity to show how well the company was doing, riding in private jets, throwing lavish parties and driving top-of-the-range cars.

Now he says this was merely branding, and he does not own a private jet.

In him, the Bulgarian founders found a talented marketer who switched from flying planes to become the public face of SportPesa.

To get into his office at the Chancery building, you have to pass through a swanky reception furnished with giant seats shaped like gloves and balls.

Taking pride of place in his office, on a wall to his right is an autographed Arsenal jersey of Aaron Ramsey.

University dropout

A tense moment of discomfort passes through the room when we stare at the jersey, perhaps because it is a painful reminder of the glory days of SportPesa. The only consolation now, perhaps, is the fact that the footballer has since left Arsenal.

Next to it is another autographed memento of Hristo Stoichkov, one of the best footballers of his generation and who is considered the greatest Bulgarian footballer of all time.

“To SportPesa, all the best,” Stoichkov writes before his signature in black ink. Below it is another plaque that reads: “Top scorer in 1994 Fifa World Cup, awarded the Ballon d’Or in 1994,” the Stoichkov souvenir reads in part.

Karauri’s story begins in Meru, where he was born. The family moved to Nairobi, where he grew up.

“I think we moved to Nairobi because my dad was a politician, so I grew up in Buruburu, went to Harambee Primary School,” he says.

He completed secondary education at Mang’u in 1996, from where he joined the University of Nairobi to train as a mechanical engineer.

“As I was doing mechanical engineering, the opportunity for Kenya Airways opened up. It was the first time they were doing initial pilot training. So, I dropped out of university in my third year of mechanical engineering and started flying with Kenya Airways,” he says.

He worked at KQ for 11 years. Six years as a co-pilot and five as a captain.

Karauri has been through many storms. As a pilot, he literally flew through storms. And he knows that at the end of every turbulence, there is always tranquility.

At Kenya Airways, he was among the pioneer class that went for pilot training in Ethiopia.

Highflying aviation career

“We are the only people who went to Addis. After coming back and recounting our hardship to KQ, they shifted the training to South Africa. Our conversion was quite difficult at Ethiopia Airline since they used the American system and their exams are much simpler compared to what we come to find in Kenya,” he said.

Nothing can possibly be harder in the life of a pilot trainee than training using a Cessna 122 to fly the Boeing 737.

In 10 years, he had been promoted to become a captain and was flying the biggest planes in KQ’s stable then.

That is before he moved to the powerful aviation union where he became the secretary general of the Kenya Airline Pilots Association (Kalpa).

“The highlight of my flying career was when I became a captain because that is the time you are given responsibility. You are in command of the aircraft, the lives you carry are in your hands. It is also a show of confidence that you can perform.”

So, why did Karauri leave what looked like a highflying career, to bet on sports gambling?

He says before he was convinced to jump ship from KQ, the initial shareholders at SportPesa were just three -- Guerassim Nikolov, Gene Grand and the Dick Wathika.

“The rest of the shareholders joined later. Some joined even after the business had started operating,” he says.

“After sitting and seeing the potential, I decided this is something I wanted to risk. So, I sold a small piece of land and decided to put all the money in. It was a very expensive investment at the time,” he says.

The combined initial investment was $5 million, which works to about Sh543 million at the current exchange rates.

SportPesa's initial shareholders

“It was a big risk but if done properly we really believed that it could take off.”

Grand, the other Bulgarian, was both a shareholder and a director at the time.

“Dick Wathika, Gero, and Gene Grand were very good friends and they had done other business together. The initial shareholders were the three of them, before I joined. Honestly, these were friends who started the company,” he says.

The SportPesa boss says Wathika was one of the people he negotiated with when he acquired his 6 percent stake in the company.

In the initial stages in 2014, when they had a misunderstanding with Safaricom on the nature of their business, he says Wathika led a delegation of SportPesa officials to explain to the telco how it would work.

“Because we had a big misunderstanding with Safaricom, we, at some point, closed for almost a month because they wanted a revenue share,” Karauri adds.

And it is perhaps at this time that Wathika went for his friend and village mate Paul Ndung’u and convinced him to buy shares in the company. Ndung’u, a tycoon who made his billions at Safaricom as a dealer, would help them get Safaricom on board.

Ndung’u and Karauri do not see eye to eye following a bitter boardroom falling out last year.

Ndung’u and other shareholders joined a little later. In total, the company ended up with 10 board members, seven of whom were shareholders.

Ndung’u would become chairman following the death of Wathika after the meeting at Finix Casino.

Crimes that SportPesa committed

“We interacted a lot with Dick. He was a very strong chairman. Actually, we really depended on him for most of the stuff. He really guided us in terms of manoeuvering in the regulatory environment. He had a lot of experience in that, so we were fortunate to have him at that point,” Karauri says.

Before SportPesa came calling, Karauri had tried his hand at a few businesses, the most notable being the Skylux Lounge, a popular club in Nairobi’s Westlands area.

The opportunity was offered to me to come to SportPesa and I realised if you are not part of the operation of that business, sometimes you might miss out on a lot of things,” he says.

But it was a tough task explaining to his family that he was moving from flying planes to gambling.

“It was a tough decision. I remember trying to explain to my family and friends, they thought I was a mad man. I was now at the peak of my pilot’s career. But I was ready to take the leap of faith and to move to the other side.”

Move he did, and his life changed.

“Initially, not much changed because I was still involved in KQ. The business was growing and we were monitoring in terms of registration, so not much changed,” he said.

“But with the publicity and the growth of the company, things changed, especially for me since I was handling a jackpot of about Sh200 million and that is when my life became more public.""

Very few companies have been shut down by the government due to a tax dispute. In fact, in most instances, once caught, the taxman prefers to go the easy route of working out a repayment schedule.

In case the taxpayer disagrees with the tax bill, there is a tax dispute resolution mechanism and a parallel court process that has the final word on who pays what. But the government did not allow this process to come to an end.

So just what hit SportPesa and what crimes did the company really commit?

 ,"Dick Wathika was a man with a good heart. Though troubled, his heart was healthy.

That was until he met two Bulgarians, Guerassim Nikolov and Gene Grand, in Nairobi. They wanted his help to start a gambling business, and he offered to deal.

Wathika, a likeable bespectacled politician with a cheerful persona, put his heart into it and, as he would realise rather too late, his health too.

For a man who had grown up in Maringo ward in Nairobi’s Eastlands, Wathika, a boxer, looked streetwise. But looks deceive.

His star started rising after he tossed himself into national politics in 1992, and at only 19, he became Kenya’s youngest councillor and later, Nairobi’s youngest mayor.

He also served as Makadara MP between 2007 and 2010 before his election was nullified.

Gambling dungeons

But SportPesa – or rather life in the gambling dungeons where mischief and sleaze rule – was a different ballgame. It was dangerous, rough and run behind the scenes by the mafia, whose love for lavish parties, yachts and jets was epic. It was Wathika who went to look for Nairobi billionaire Paul Ndung’u, an accountant who made his fortune as a Safaricom dealer, to invest in SportPesa.

The billionaire would dip into his deep pockets to inject the much-needed capital to boost initial marketing efforts for SportPesa, to propel it into the big leagues. Both Ndung’u and Wathika knew very little about betting. But sadly for them, despite the fortune it made for them, it would end in death for Wathika and tears for Ndung’u.

SportPesa was in many ways a family-run business. Indeed, the Bulgarian families are distantly related through marriage. But despite their combined skills and experience, SportPesa might never have got off the ground were it not for its deep-pocketed Nairobi shareholders.

Kenya Charity Sweepstake

It was Wathika who opened the doors for Nikolov and Grand’s lottery and casinos to thrive in the capital. In early 2005, Wathika showed how far he was willing to go to have the Bulgarians set up shop.

One morning in 2005, hundreds of Kenya Charity Sweepstake ticket sellers woke up to find that their lottery kiosks, their livelihoods, demolished by the defunct Nairobi City Council.

The demolitions happened with the blessings of Wathika. Booths owned by Nikolov’s Toto 6/49 lottery occupied their vacated spots. In the years after, Wathika was occasionally spotted in Nairobi hotels in the company of the Bulgarians. He told anyone who cared to ask that they were his business partners.

Before Ndung’u came fully on board, Wathika was the financially stable partner in the business. He bailed out the Bulgarians on more than one occasion when unpaid debts and the odd unexpected player jackpot threatened to cripple their gambling businesses.

Major shareholder

This is how he ended up being a major shareholder and founding chairman of SportPesa, which launched in Nairobi in 2014.

For his part, Ndung’u was at first an absentee director despite putting in Sh100 million to start off the project. Though he owned 17 per cent shareholding in Pevans East Africa Ltd, the company that would register the SportPesa trademark, he had left Wathika as his boardroom sentry – to keep watch over the Bulgarians, whom he barely knew.

But as in the proverbial tale of the Arab, the camel and the tent, Wathika soon found out that after billions started flowing into SportPesa coffers, his space in the boardroom was shrinking. Instead, a newcomer, a university engineering course dropout-turned-pilot, Ronald Karauri, and the two Bulgarians had slowly edged him out of the decision-making table.

Like Wathika, Karauri – a son of former Tigania MP Adams Karauri – had also grown up in Eastlands, in Buru Buru Estate.

An ‘A’ student at Mang’u High School, he had been admitted to study engineering at the University of Nairobi and then quit to join Kenya Airways as a trainee pilot.

Karauri learned quickly, after all he was one of the best aviation students nationally in secondary school exams. Karauri was ambitious. While serving as a pilot, he had been fascinated by the Texas hold ‘em poker game that he played with his friends for fun. And, as he would later say, that is how he found himself at Finix Casino in Nairobi’s Hurlingham section making bets on real money – rather than playing the game with his friends.

Karauri’s Sh30m investment

It was at the poker table that he met the Bulgarians, the proprietors of Finix Casino, known for its great ambience and complimentary food and drinks. He had a good job as a captain with Kenya Airways and had Sh30 million to invest. Wathika was another regular at the casino.

The former Nairobi mayor, who had also contested the Mukurweini seat and polled 15,071 votes on a Mazingira Party ticket against Kabando wa Kabondo’s 15,454 votes, had known the Bulgarians since their arrival in Kenya, helping them to set up lottery booths around the city.

By getting city tycoons to invest in the Bulgarians’ project, Wathika had won some shares and was listed as the board chairman. Kenya was witnessing a gambling boom, fuelled by a faster internet, a love of the English Premier League and cheaper phones.

SportPesa was launched in February 2014 with fanfare to, perhaps, take advantage of the Fifa World Cup that would take place in Brazil from June 12 to July 13, 2014. The craze had not been anticipated, and the torrent of cash was dizzying.

Disturbed man

It is not clear at what point the relationship between Wathika and the Bulgarians started to sour. But by December 2015, Wathika was a disturbed man. And so were his business friends.

Before SportPesa started its tax-dodging mayhem, its gambling potential had been tested through an SMS-based lotto Shinda Smart 6969, which had brought in hundreds of millions of shillings and was quickly flagged by the Kenya Revenue Authority.

But Wathika could see that things were not going well. His blood pressure rose. He was now trapped in the bowels of an international gambling syndicate – where tax evasion, money laundering and subtle threats are part of the business cuisine.

Karauri quit his KQ job, much to the disappointment of his friends, to become the CEO of SportPesa. He took over Wathika’s corner office.

Wathika badly wanted his office on the third floor of The Chancery building on Nairobi’s Valley Road, at least to get a feel from within of what was happening within SportPesa, a brand name he had helped to build by bringing in Ndung’u – a man who had injected Sh100 million to help the business start.

Major shareholders

By 2015, the Bulgarians owned 21 per cent of the business and Ndung’u 17 per cent. While it had been agreed that anybody with more than a 5 per cent stake could join the board, some of the major shareholders, like Ndung’u, had left Wathika to keep watch – perhaps the reason he was being sidelined.

His health took a direct hit.

By October 2015, when he was first admitted to Karen Hospital with blood pressure, it was now clear that SportPesa was taking a toll on his health. At the hospital, those who saw him say, any discussion of SportPesa would trigger an attack and nurses had to ask visitors out after the bedside monitors tracking blood pressure sounded an alarm.

Then the worst happened.

December 14, 2015. Wathika is invited to go and thrash out the issues at Finix Casino. He drove himself and met the Bulgarians. The meeting went on until late afternoon. Before it ended, the former mayor collapsed. But he quickly picked himself up.

As he stepped out of the boardroom some minutes to 7pm, he collapsed one more time at the doorstep. An artery had ruptured, according to a post-mortem report.

Cardiac arrest

He died of suspected cardiac arrest that December. Gambling was not a safe bet, even as a business.

While Wathika’s friends questioned, albeit privately, why the Bulgarians did not rush him to the nearby Nairobi Hospital, some 600 metres away, and opted to drive with him, and in the evening traffic jam, for 12km to Karen Hospital, nobody was willing to expose the infighting at SportPesa.

Wathika’s phone disappeared too, leaving many unanswered questions.

Just what happened at Finix Casino? For this and much more, listen to ‘A Country of Gamblers’, a podcast about the rise, fall and attempted resurrection of SportPesa.

Let’s talk! Confronting the age-old problem of sexual harassment,"Early February, 23-year-old Esther*, started her two-month internship at a broadcast media company in Nairobi.

She is a Media and Communication student at a local university where she majored in electronic media. Two weeks into her internship, the company’s head of production, a male in his early 30s, started making unwelcome sexual moves on her.

“Every time, he was around me, he could tell me I have a nice body and that he could not wait to have me in his bed,” she shares.

“At first, I laughed it off. But the comments kept coming. He could call me in the middle of the night and tell me how he missed me, yet he and I were in the office, the whole time.”

This went on for about a week until she felt it was about time to make it clear that she wasn’t interested in his sex innuendos.

Incidentally, both had plans to confront each other on the same day. She arrived at the office, ready to speak her mind, only for him to come to her desk, grab her hand and pull her to an outdoor garden.

“I want to have sex with you. So when is that happening?” he asked her.

Esther says she was shocked by his outright demand.

“I told him I respect myself so much that I cannot sleep with him for just a night and walk away like nothing happened,” she says.

From then, he started avoiding her and could not assign her any roles. She spent sleepless nights wondering what her next move should be, having been cut off from gaining practical experience. She reached out to a female colleague.

It is a small-scale company with less than 10 employees, she says.

Her response was even more depressing: “He is known for that behaviour and there is nothing you can do. We don’t have guidelines on who to report to when that happens. Just let it go.”

It was until she threatened to tell his wife of his unprofessional behaviour that he changed and resumed treating her professionally – sending her out for assignments and according her the necessary support in line of duty.

Esther’s experience is a definitive example of quid pro quo harassment, a form of sexual harassment in which employment decisions are made based on an employee’s acceptance or rejection of unwelcome sexual behaviour. In this case, the head of department withdrawing his supervisory role on her because she declined his demand for sexual relations.

Available evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other.

Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Sexual harassment is not limited to office space. It happens everywhere – from formal to informal interactions; in the online and offline spaces.

It happens on social media, markets, supermarkets, gyms, hotels, salons, tea buying centres, churches, banking halls or on the road as one heads to the shop or the river. The list is long.

In Kenya, sexual harassment is a criminal offence. Clause 23 of the Sexual Offences Act (2006) prohibits any person in authority or holding a public office from making sexual advances or requests. Such a person is liable to a minimum three-year jail term or penalty of not less than Sh100,000.

The Act further criminalises other forms of sexual harassment such as sexual assault, attempted rape and indecent acts. These offences attract a five to a 10-year jail term.

Busia Woman Representative Ms Florence Mutua had through her Sexual Offences (Amendment), 2016 sought to further specify forms of sexual harassment.

She wanted “any contact between any part of the body of a person with the genital organs, breasts or buttocks of another …and exposure or display (of the same) or pornographic material to any person against his or her will,” to be criminalised. The bill failed to get the legislators’ approval.

On the other hand, previously under the Employment Act (2007), only companies with more than 20 employees were bound by law to have a sexual harassment policy.

But now, the Employment (Amendment) Act, 2019, demands of firms with more than five employees to have the policy. It should clearly state that each employee is entitled to employment that is free of sexual harassment, how to report the offences and redress measures thereof.

Scanty statistics

Despite the existence of anti-sexual harassment laws, the reality of women and men becoming victims is evident.

Scanty statistics are available on offline sexual harassment. The media has, however, captured such cases. For instance, last year, a police officer in Nakuru was caught on camera pulling a suspect’s genitals in an attempt to force him to board a waiting police vehicle.

For online, studies on digital security have shown prevalence of sexual harassment. A 2016 joint survey by Association of Media Women in Kenya (Amwik) and Article 19 Eastern Africa established that some 75 per cent of female journalists in Kenya have suffered online harassment, these included sexual harassment.

Available evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other, an indication of either the public’s ignorance or disillusionment.

It is possible to successfully litigate a sexual harassment offence.

In 2017, a Kericho Employment and Labour Relations court awarded a female clinical officer Sh600,000 as general damages for sexual harassment. In case 53 of 2017, the officer had sued her manager for sexual advances. She declined, a decision she argued to have prompted him to end her employment at the health facility.

Diamond Trust Bank, Head of HR Ms Lillian Ngala, says a human resource officer is obliged to take action against claims of sexual harassment.

Ignoring the complaints

The aggrieved member of the staff must, however, provide proof to the claim, which can be in form of emails, calls, texts or colleagues to whom one has confided.

Ignoring the complaints could be tantamount to abetting sexual harassment in the workplace, a conduct that can lead to one losing certificate of practice with Institute of Human Resource Management, she says.

She observes that annual sensitisation of staff through strategies such as refresher courses and email reminders, are crucial to eliminating breeding ground for sexual harassment.

Eagle HR Consultants Chief Executive Officer, Mr Patrick Mutisya, adds that an employee has a right to seek justice through the court if the employer fails to take action within 14 days of notice.

“The person who fails to take action is actually a collaborator (in abetting the offence),”says Mr Mutisya.

But to successfully prosecute such as case, one needs to provide concrete evidence such as an email or a letter, he advises.

Federation of Women Lawyers-Kenya (Fida-Kenya) Legal Counsel, Ms Vivian Mwende says “when it comes to sexual harassment, the burden of proof lies with the person who is claiming sexual harassment.”

Labour Policy Consultant at Learn Africa Solutions, Mr Alphonce Were says employers must purpose to educate their employees to avoid normalising sexual harassment.

“Employees should be aware that sexual statements about their body parts are not normal jokes,” he says.

This is my story...Sabina Chege

In March 2018, Murang’a Woman Representative Ms Sabina Chege, found herself in the middle of a storm.

An alleged conman, Benson Chacha was using her number to solicit money from Cabinet Secretaries and her fellow MPs in addition to sending the MPs sexually explicit messages.

Ms Chege together with 13 other female MPs reported the harassment to Parliament Police Station. When Directorate of Criminal Investigations, director Mr George Kinoti appeared before the National Assembly Committee on National Security to shed light on investigations of the matter, he said he had concluded that “there is special relation between the complainants and the suspect.”

This opened the floor for online sexual harassment against Ms Chege with a Twitter account even opened using her photo and that of the suspect, and using an implicating username. The account is still active to-date.

Later, the DCI refuted the “special relation” statement but the damage was already done on the part of Ms Chege.

The harassment was “a worst case scenario,” Ms Chege says.

“It is really sad even the way the police handled the matter. We are still in court. The court has delayed the case till to-day. If somebody at my level can be treated that way, what about an ordinary woman?” she wonders.

For nominated Member of the Nairobi County Assembly Ms Silvia Museiya, being spammed with sexually suggestive conversations on her phone and social media accounts is common.

“I just ignore,” she says, “The moment you start indulging, it becomes a back and forth issue. There is an assumption that women in leadership have used sex to get up, and so the best way to handle it is to prove that you have a mind of your own, and that you are confident in your own space, and men can read that very easily.”

Unsafe behind the wheel: An Uber driver and her ‘sexual advances’ journey

Women taxi drivers face the same security concerns as male drivers; however, they additionally face gender-dominated forms of victimisation.

Peris Wangari Wanjiku, an Uber driver, recalls a time she picked a client in Langa’ta who wanted to go to Kahawa West. On their way, Ms Wanjiku says the client, who had been talkative for most of the trip disclosed he had no place to go and requested her to spend the night with him in the car.

As an act of kindness, and to avoid a confrontation, she decided to park her car at a petrol station along Thika Road, the safest place she could think of, until dawn.

For her, working as a taxi driver in Nairobi has been the most enjoyable and rewarding form of employment but it has come with a fair share of challenges.

Ms Wanjiku says most of her male clients make sexual advances at her and it does not amuse her anymore because she knows how to handle such behaviour. Some ask her for a date, while others make uninvited remarks.

Many of her male clients, she reveals, start hitting on her the moment they start the journey. They will tell her how beautiful she is and request for a date.

On average, five out of every 10 male clients, she says, make sexual advances at her.This, she says, mostly happens at night when ferrying inebriated clients, with both young and old clients making unwelcome advances in equal measure.

“Many start telling me they want to take me for coffee and get to know me because they are having issues with either their girlfriends or wives. They will shower me with compliments, saying they like aggressive and hard-working women like me, and not their lazy wives and girlfriends,” she says.

Keen not to bring an argument or a misunderstanding in the course of their journey, Ms Wanjiku says she plays along and remains polite until they reach their destination. They then strike a deal that they talk over the phone the following day, as a gesture of politeness.

“Many of them will call the following day and that is when I tell them I am married and a family woman who is only in business to fend for my family,” she says.

One time, she says, she got a request from a man of Chinese origin. When they got to their destination, she says the Chinese man looked at her, gave her some extra money and told her to go home and cook for the children.

Ms Wanjiku reveals that in her kind of business, she can only be polite to the male clients lest she losses business. What she ensures is that she does not allow the advances to go beyond limits.

Despite the sexual advances, she says male clients are usually very friendly, generous and has never encountered a violent one.

A gym instructor, his female clients and the limits

The gym is a great place for rejuvenating the body and mind. It can, however, be an intimidating and daunting place, making one feel vulnerable.

Like many other environments, it is prone to sexual harassment with the most common types including being unnecessarily stared at, indecent touch, having one’s personal space invaded without invitation, and unnecessary comments about appearance.

The gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client.

The gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client. This is where the thin line between upholding professionalism and managing emotional attachment that comes with hours, weeks, months and even years of an instructor training one client comes in.

Studies show that women are the most sexually harassed in the gym, but men too, are prone to harassment.

Arnold Opuka*, a gym instructor in Kisumu, is alive to this fact. When we meet him at his place of work, he tells The Voice that he has also been a victim of sexual harassment.

Suggestive comments about their physique abound, with women referring to them as hunks, and suggesting which parts of their bodies the instructor should touch as they train.

""Many of these women, aged between 35 and 55 years, have money and easily influence young instructors. Some have fallen victims and lost their jobs,"" says Mr Opuka.

He reveals that the women are tactful, only giving glances with limited open expressions of their desire for someone. This, he says, requires a keen eye to notice the advances.

At times, especially during stretching exercises, some will do the routines suggestively.

He, however, reveals that the actual sexual advances happen during private sessions.

""The women are more open and tempt instructors by the manner in which they act around you,"" says the 31-year-old.

He adds that when these women come to the gym, their eyes are not only trained on the instructors, but also the young well-built men who work out in the gym.

While most of these incidences appear consensual, he maintains that it is wrong and can be avoided, warning his colleagues against according specific clients special attention as that is bound to build attachment.

""Women are a jealous lot and that is why you have to treat all of them equally. Smile with all, psyche and assist all, and above all, be professional,” says Mr Opuka.

How much is reasonable bride price? Lessons from Tana River man’s Sh7,"When Hussein Charo from Tana River County asked for only Sh7 as bride price in December last year, he did not only baffle his guests, he also scaled national news because the action defied popular practice of turning such occasions into income-generating activities.

This was the second time Charo acted “strangely”. When his first daughter got married, he asked only for prayer beads, saying he was more interested in his son-in-law’s integrity than wealth.

This behaviour raises questions about bride price. Why do we consider it mandatory? How does it affect the status of women relative to men in marriage? What is women’s say about it? How much is reasonable and how much is not? Who is the primary beneficiary?

Prospective children

The consideration takes the form of livestock, money, foodstuff, utensils, other material items and even labour, depending on the community. Two scholars, John S. Mbiti and Isaac Osabutey-Aguedze, aver that bride price was traditionally to cement inter-familial relationships, express gratitude for the girl’s upbringing, ‘compensate’ for the transferred labour, demonstrate the man’s willingness to enter into a marriage and signal his ability to take care of the wife and prospective children. The gifts were reminders of the maiden’s physical absence and signified her value to the maiden and marital families.

No one should begrudge individuals from continuing with the practice as the Constitution of Kenya embeds the right to one’s culture. The Marriage Act (2014) also recognises the practice but requires it to be only a token to formalise customary unions.

From a gender perspective, bride-price is a patriarchal relic that subjugates women. In the first instance, the negotiations are male affairs even though the subject matter is a woman.

In fact, the bride does not even share in the payment or have a say on how it is used. In the second, men paying it (some under duress) wait to recover their pound of flesh through dominance over their wives citing the power assigned to them by the bride price. This is evident in cases where men count their wives as part of their property.

Dysfunctional unions

In some communities, women are subjected to insults insinuating that their level of intelligence is equal to that of the animals paid for them! Also, the understanding that the bride price is recovered should the marriage break down puts pressure on women to tolerate dysfunctional unions to protect the parents from the imminent loss.

Bride price has today become so steep, it is basically a captive wealth generating activity for the bride’s family, technically the paternal side, and a burdensome tax on men. In many cases, the price is based on the bride’s level of formal education and career. The higher the two, the more the expectation, as evident in the October 2019 case in Meru where a man demanded Sh1 million, to the chagrin of the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders, which in turn vowed to draft a law standardising the payment in their area of jurisdiction.

An anecdote from one nuptial experience has it that a medical doctor went to pay bride price for his partner, also a doctor. But the father-in-law made it clear that the amount paid was not commensurate with his daughter’s status. The groom apologised but gave his father-in-law a piece of poetic justice. He asked him to replace her with one equivalent to his means!

Nuptial ceremonies

Simply put, placing a price on a bride commercialises marriage, objectifies women and transforms them into wares for sale, in the same way as done in ancient Russia where they were called Kunka, derived from Kuna (marten), the currency of payment.

A cursory look reveals that nuptial ceremonies today are more of exhibitions of financial, material and vehicular grandeur than anything else. This is evident in comments equating success with the number of guests and expensive cars in attendance. This not only puts pressure on men, it also diverts attention from the primary purpose of marriage.

From the deep entrenchment of the practice, any suggestion to outlaw it would be opposed by both men and women, the former because this would disrobe them of power and the latter because it is probably the only expression of appreciation they and their parents are assured of.

Gender equality

Mr Charo’s action, comical as it looks, is a reminder that we should re-examine bride price in light of gender equality. Standardising the payment might appear like interference with personal choice.

However, it will return some sanity and redeem the practice from the financially draining monster it has become. It is also time we replaced the term ‘bride price’ with ‘gifts’ to remove the commercial connotation. The Njuri Ncheke also owes us an update on the draft law.

"Like Scotland, Kenya can end period poverty","Menstruation is an uncomfortable, painful, inconvenient and expensive experience for many women and girls. It occurs once a month for approximately three to seven days; about three months a year.

Those with no access to menstruation products are left to their own devices to manage their menstruation cycles, with many unable to participate meaningfully in daily life due to the difficulty of managing bleeding.

Many girls resort to using unhygienic substitutes such as rags, newspapers, banana leaves, and even cow dung. Worse still, others turn to prostitution to get these essential products.

Unfortunately, period poverty – the lack of access to menstrual products – increases the risk of toxic shock syndrome, cervical cancer and other dangerous infections according to research.

While period poverty has always been the stark reality for some, Covid-19 has exacerbated menstruation-related challenges, especially for women and girls from urban slums and poor rural communities.

Menstrual hygiene

Globally, women and girls’ rights activists are asking governments to integrate sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls in Covid-19 responses. In Kenya, at least 2.6 million girls currently require menstrual hygiene materials – pads, underwear and soap, according to Unesco.

In April last year, local women rights organisations petitioned the government to spend at least 30 per cent share of Covid-19 funds on gender responsive strategies including distributing cash relief, food and sanitary towels to vulnerable women and girls.

The pandemic aside, the menstrual hygiene situation in Kenya has been, and remains dire. Thousands of adolescent girls have to contend with hurdles as they go through formal schooling. In September last year, a school girl in Bomet committed suicide after her teacher humiliated her for staining her uniform during her menses.

It is sad this happened nine years after Kenya launched the Sanitary Towels Programme in 2011 – an initiative meant to provide pads to needy girls in public schools. It is the same year Kenya made sanitary towels tax-free.

Unfortunately, some girls do not receive the free sanitary towels. The government in 2019, admitted a lack of funds to provide sanitary towels as required by law, with Education CS George Magoha saying the Sh470 million provided can only supply girls for four months.

Lack of access to sanitary products means many girls drop out of school while on their period, putting them at greater risk of child marriage and early pregnancy.

In 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Basic Education Amendment Act (2016) placing the responsibility of providing free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels on the government, to reduce the number of girls missing school.

In 2019, the government launched the Menstrual Hygiene Policy 2019-30 to among other things, ensure women and girls have access to safe and hygienic products.

All these measures were aimed at ending period poverty. However, that goal is yet to be met with Education CS last year admitting that the government scheme had not met its target, and many girls are still missing school during their menses.

Disadvantaged girl

The United Nations estimates that as many as 20 million girls drop out of schools (globally) every year because they cannot deal with their menstrual flows. The Education ministry estimates that a girl absent from school for four days a month loses 13 learning days equivalent to two weeks per term.

This means that in an academic year, a disadvantaged girl loses up to 39 learning days, something that could be remedied by proper implementation of the sanitary towels program.

Access to sanitary products would also be of limited help if schools don’t have the supporting infrastructure, such as separate bathrooms for girls with doors and locks for privacy, a luxury in most of our rural public schools.

Menstruation is a global issue and there is evidence of action to address its challenges. Last year, Scotland became the first country in the world to provide free period products for all women, while Germany reduced tax on sanitary towels from 19 per cent to seven per cent.

Canada, Australia and India followed suit. France, Spain, Poland and Austria have also lowered tax on sanitary products. A handful of US States have also passed laws mandating free period products be provided in schools. The UK government too, rolled out free period products in all primary and secondary schools in England last year.

Kenya’s menstrual policies all look good on paper, but wouldn’t work in a real-world environment if not managed well. With proper management, we too, like Scotland, can make sanitary products free for all. Every woman is entitled to safe and hygienic menstrual facilities, and the right to manage menstruation without shame or stigma.

It is time to change the narrative, girls and women have suffered enough.

"From the US to Lesotho, Covid-19 crushed women's hopes as global supply chains came tumbling down","In her last weeks working the freight shift at the local J.C. Penney store, Alexandra Orozco took out her phone and hit record. The 22-year-old shot a video of the giant black-and-red ’Everything Must go!” posters, and posted it on TikTok in October.

“Slowly losing my job,” she wrote below, days before the store in Delano, California shut for good, one of 156 J.C. Penney stores across the United States to close since June of last year.

Since being laid off, she has applied for a couple of roles – counselling kids, delivering flowers – but has yet to hear back. “It’s so sad,” she explains over the phone.

“And it’s hard to find jobs here.”

Halfway across the world, Matefo Litali experienced upheaval, too. A skilled sewer, the 53-year-old worked at Tzicc Clothing, apparel-maker for US-based giants J.C. Penney and Walmart, in Lesotho, a small mountainous country surrounded by South Africa. She was employed for two months before nationwide lock-down measures forced all garment factories to temporarily close in March. After two days back at work, Tzicc confirmed her last day was May 7, 2020.

“I felt powerless,” she says.

“The first thing that went through my mind was, ‘Why me?” Neither woman has met. Nor are they likely to; one lives in a remote agricultural town on the west coast of America, the other 10,000 miles away in Southern Africa.

Supply chains

Now, both of their lives – and livelihoods – are linked by a global pandemic that has crushed one of the world’s supply chains and with it, economies, too.

Covid-19 lock-downs have obliterated a retail sector already struggling to survive before the coronavirus hit, which has in turn, contributed to the collapse of the global garment trade and wreaked havoc for millions of workers, the vast majority being women like Ms Orozco and Ms Litali.

Over the past two decades Lesotho’s garment industry, where nine out of 10 workers are women, has boomed to become its largest employer, crafting clothes for Levis Strauss, Wrangler and Walmart.

While Lesotho is a lesser-known garment powerhouse compared to China or Bangladesh, it is another example of an economy heavily reliant on US demand. Outside of the African continent, America is the largest recipient of Lesotho’s exports – accounting for almost half –according to the most recently available World Trade Organisation data from 2017.In the US, meanwhile, clothing retailers have been hit particularly hard. The country is one of the world’s top importers of clothing, accounting for nearly a quarter of global retail spend.

While J.C. Penney hasn’t been profitable since 2010, the 118-year-old chain filed for bankruptcy in May last year. Six months later, it was bought out but its workforce was slashed by more than 10,000 during restructuring, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to The Fuller Project.

US retailers

J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers also filed for bankruptcy this year. “And when a big US retailer takes a tumble,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, “the effects are felt across the globe.”

Last March, as US retailers cancelled or failed to pay for existing orders worth billions of dollars, the effects quickly rippled down the supply chain. At Tzicc Clothing, roughly one fifth of employees have lost their jobs since May last year, says Tšepang Makakole of Lesotho’s National Clothing and Textile Workers Union. ""For women, it’s a disaster...The industry is facing a total collapse.”

Ms Litali felt weak in the knees when she heard that she was suddenly unemployed. A widow for the last eight years, the seamstress single-handedly supports her youngest daughter, who is 20, and her four-year-old grandchild.

During the lock-down, her employer delayed her final $94 (Sh10,000) pay check for three months until May. The Human Resources manager at Tzicc Clothing, Masefatsa Mofolo, confirmed the company laid off staff due to limited orders. For months, Ms Litali received no income or support, instead surviving off donated food from the local church until her final salary arrived.

J.C. Penney

“I got so stressed; I thought I was going mad,” she says. “I would spend the whole day sleeping.”

Back in California, Ms Orozco occasionally walks past the town’s J.C. Penney. The windows are free from sale signs, the gates locked.

“I was close to the cleaning lady who worked there,” she says. “It broke my heart to know I probably won’t ever see her again.” A spokesperson for J.C. Penney declined to comment on the closures.

Although Ms Orozco lives with her parents, she still has car and phone bills. When her store closed temporarily in mid-March in adherence with Covid-19 measures, she was out of work for three months and applied for unemployment.

She used the time to finesse her side-hustle: a make-up business, selling lashes, lip glosses and clothes via Instagram.

She earns roughly $200-300 (Sh21,000-33,000) per month in sales, nearly five times less than her salary at J.C. Penney.

Today, both Ms Litali and Ms Orozco’s lives look uncertain. In August, Litali landed a job sewing jeans at another factory, but she fears her temporary contract won’t be renewed. By next year, Orozco hopes to have saved enough to open a brick-and-mortar store. “It’s stressful but… I know one day it will be worth it.”

Women must shun the conduct of stereotyping female politicians,"Charity Ngilu, the second governor of Kitui County and one of the two elected women county bosses, thrust herself into Kenya’s presidential race after being in politics for barely five years, as an MP, and after only one parliamentary term.

The then Kitui Central MP, alongside the late Prof Wangari Maathai, made history with the – no doubt courageous and daring move – to become the first women in the country to contest the presidency – for years an exclusive boys’ club.

This was in the 1997 General Election that saw Ms Ngilu emerge an impressive fifth, to beat among others, veteran politician Martin Shikuku of Ford Asili, in the contest predictably won by Kanu’s incumbent, the late Daniel Arap Moi.

Prof Maathai came 13th in the crowded race of 15 candidates. Although hers has since been a consistence rise in the political leadership, holding Cabinet positions in the successive administration of Presidents Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta (after 2013 elections) – and now governor, Ms Ngilu is yet to attempt the presidency again.

Likewise, Ms Martha Karua, the long serving MP for Gichugu, a former minister in the Kibaki administration and the Narc-Kenya party leader, made a go at the highest office, in the 2013 General Election. She was the only woman in the ring of eight candidates.

Elected female governor

In the 2017 elections, Ms Karua returned to her Kirinyaga home county, contested the governorship and lost to Ms Anne Waiguru – the other elected female governor – in a closely contested race. Ms Karua disputed the results and unsuccessfully challenged them up to the Supreme Court.

In November last year, however, she won a reprieve at the Arusha-based East African Court of Justice and was awarded Sh2.7 million in damages for violations of her rights to a fair hearing in the petition.

Nairobi’s Anne Kananu Mwenda, was sworn in as the deputy governor last month, to replace impeached Mike Mbuvi Sonko. He had nominated her as his deputy before he was pushed out of office through a no-confidence vote by the Nairobi County Assembly.

This is just but a brief summary of recent history that tells of the struggles as well as experiences and of course resilience, of some of the most outstanding Kenyan women in the country’s male-dominated field – as they seek to fight their way to the nation’s top political echelons and leadership.

Elective political office

Although more women are now moving to top management roles in other sectors, indications are clear that the journey to high – specifically elective political office, is still replete with thorns. This reluctance to level the political field to ensure fair competition of women and men is what makes many Kenyans of goodwill – especially women – be deeply sceptical that there will be gender parity in the country’s politics.

As Kenya’s women battle for political space and top positions in politics, however, it is important for them to celebrate and support those already,  or on their way up, after defying many odds to achieve that feat. That support – moral or otherwise – by fellow women, is critical in encouraging those who intend to join politics to do so, with the knowledge that a sister will be present to not only egg them on, but to also give a shoulder to cry on.

Similarly, most of those already in positions will without a doubt, do with the encouragement, support and even mentorship of fellow women, to keep moving on.

That is why women should keep away from the common conduct of stereotyping leaders of the female gender, especially those in politics. This, however, is not to say that women should not criticise their own when they stray as leaders. Asking that of women is undemocratic and amounts to suppressing their voices.

Gender parity

It is also undemocratic – and this is very common, when leaders – in explaining away the low number of elected women in Parliament and County Assembly, take to a blanket blame of women voters “who are the majority, and cannot elect their own’’! Women, like all other Kenyans, are entitled to vote for candidates of their choice, irrespective of the gender.

Instead, as Kenyans, we must support women leadership by electing those qualified to the position. In the meantime, history has taught us that when women are not elected and appointed to political office, political decisions made do not sufficiently serve the needs and inclinations of the female gender.

That is why women leaders and those who support the course of gender parity must learn to reject and keep voicing out against the notion that women are to be “given” positions. Women and men are equal in the eyes of Kenya’s Constitution.

"On a mission to keep girls in school, protect them from sex pests","While living at a border town often offers lucrative cross-border trade for many people, this is not the case for teenage girls in Busia County.  Snarl-up of long distance trucks is a common feature at the town that borders Uganda.

The situation worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic with truck drivers having to spend longer days at the border town due to pandemic related checks.

Confronted with poverty, teenage girls and women in the region engage in sex in exchange for money; money the young girls need so much to purchase vital things like sanitary pads.

Many have dropped out of school due to early pregnancies, early marriages, lack of guidance by a responsible adult and ill-health resulting from sexually transmitted diseases.

A young Teso woman, Ms Abukayo Murunga is, however, out to change this story. The 26-year-old has been in rural Teso for the last five years, doing everything possible to bring other women into safe paths.

Access to education

“I am familiar with the challenges girls and women here go through. Challenges that limit their access to education and opportunities for growth. For instance, girls miss school during their menstruation days because of their parents’ inability to provide them with menstrual hygiene management products,"" she says.

Ms Murunga adds: ""I have seen families languishing in abject poverty and as a result, send their girls to engage in sex (not as express as it may sound) with truck drivers, as a way of fending for themselves and families. I have visited schools where girls as young as ten years have been impregnated. It breaks my heart. It is here that l find my reason to create change in this community.""

With every rising sun, Ms Murunga is out to scale up her efforts towards addressing these challenges. Her initial activities reached the girls through the Amot Network, a foundation she started eight months ago. Now she reaches them through the Border Hub – a youth and community development organisation in Busia.

Ms Murunga says she has visited schools where girls as young as ten years have been impregnated.

She provides information on sexual reproductive health and rights to enable girls (and women) make informed decisions about their sexuality and not fall victims of their own desperation.

""With other like-minded individuals and organisations in the region like (CCGD), we do structured mentorship programmes; tailored towards providing information around goal-setting, life skills such as negotiation skills, assertiveness which go a long way to enable the girls stand up for their rights,"" explains the Bachelor of Information Systems graduate.

Last June, she adopted the T-boxes (Talking Boxes) approach where girls freely drop their concerns in boxes at a local church.

""I adopted the use of T-boxes after realising that many girls were not speaking out yet they were going through a lot in their homes. Since then, the responses have been overwhelming,"" Ms Murunga says.

She plans to partner with guidance and counselling teachers in local schools to introduce T-boxes once studies steadily resume, following Covid-19 interruptions.

Ms Murunga and like-minded individuals at the Border Hub run a Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) programme where they boldly speak to youths about sex, a taboo topic in Teso.

Teso region

""I am keen on providing information that’s focused on growing and nurturing them. I spend most of my time interacting with girls and women; getting to know their challenges and, together, we develop sustainable solutions.""

Ms Murunga observes that ""they have so far reached out to at least 200 girls within Teso region. The girls then act as ambassadors in their communities, hence strengthening our reach.""

Her outreach has seen close to 50 girls who dropped out of school, due to early pregnancies enrol back in class.

Ms Murunga, who is passionate about advocacy, research and policy reforms on SRHR, is the 'Kenya ni Mimi' (a signature programme by the Ministry of Youth and ICT) ambassador for Busia County.

She is an Emerging Leaders Foundation (EFL) Fellow and the pioneer for Young African Leaders Initiative (Yali) Busia - Chapter. She characterises her success in women and girls' issues in Teso to the knowledge and leadership skills she gathers from EFL and YALI.

Resource mobilisation

Her background with EFL and YALI, she says, has put her on the map including sitting on the Busia County Youth Technical Working Group where she has been directly involved in highlighting gaps that hinder youth development.

Thanks to EFL and YALI, Ms Murunga is equipped with resource mobilisation skills that have helped her engage organisations to provide sanitary pads to needy girls, implement the Talking Boxes and hold regular talks with girls in schools and churches.

Ms Murunga recognises that female poverty and reproductive health is a problem everywhere, thus uses social media too, to move the ""powerful information"" far and wide.

""I primarily use social media platforms to amplify girls' and women’s issues,"" she tells The Voice.

The main challenge in Ms Murunga's mission, however, is lack of a stable source of funding and a society that considers the topic on sex a taboo, and a patriarchal mind-set that limits women in terms of land ownership, decision-making and leadership positions.

For the alumnus of Kisii University, women's issues are pressing challenges all over the world thus require urgent attention.

“I want to be at the very forefront influencing the formulation, implementation and strengthening of policies around reintegration of girls who get pregnant prematurely. I want to advocate for the implementation of zero price on sanitary towels so that girls can easily access them and stay in school,"" says Ms Murunga.

In the words of Mahatma Ghandi, Ms Murunga believes that she is shaking the world in a gentle way.

Too poor for menses; period!,"Anyone who menstruates requires proper access to menstrual materials, safe and hygienic facilities and the right to manage it without shame or stigma. Unfortunately, some women and adolescent girls live in period poverty.

Research shows that more than 800 million women menstruate daily and majority can’t manage their menses in a dignified and healthy way.

American Medical Women's Association defines period poverty as inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, including, but not limited to sanitary products, washing facilities and waste management.

Period poverty is an underlying issue that contributes to the persistent high numbers of teenage pregnancies.

Studies have also shown that absence of an environment supportive of the girls’ menstrual hygiene management (MHM) hinders them from attending school.

Of the 250 girls interviewed in a study – Menstrual Hygiene Management and School Absenteeism among Adolescents in Ghana: Results from a School-Based Cross-Sectional Study in a Rural Community by Shamsudeen Mohammed et al., 60.4 per cent said lack of a private place to manage periods at school kept them off.

A majority (82.2 per cent) missed school due to menstrual pain, found the study whose findings were published last year in the International Journal of Reproductive Medicine.

Another 70.3 per cent were deterred by the fear of staining and being teased, while 63.4 per cent stayed away due to non-availability of pads.

Another study Menstrual hygiene management in rural schools of Zambia; a descriptive study of knowledge, experiences and challenges faced by schoolgirls by Joyce Chinyama et al. attests to similar challenges.

Girls in six rural schools in Zambia were interviewed.

They said inadequate provision of sanitary materials, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools forced them to stay at home during menstruation.

Isolating themselves

“Boys said they could tell when girls were menstruating by their smell and behaviour, for instance, moving less and isolating themselves from their peers,” the researchers state in study published in 2019, in BMC Public Health.

“Girls complained of friction burns on their inner thighs during their long journey to school due to chaffing of wet non-absorbent material used to make menstrual cloth,” it further reads.

The findings are a reflection of Kenya’s situation. It refers to a previous study in Kenya that established that “Poor WASH facilities deter girls from using the facilities at school, with most girls opting to stay home until they finish menstruating.”

On average, girls begin puberty at 10 or 11 years depending on factors such as nutrition, guides Unesco in its 2014 document Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management.

In Kenya, Unesco estimates that some 2.6 million girls in school need support to obtain menstrual hygiene products. Further, approximately 300,000 of girls in arid and semi-arid regions would require both sanitary towels and underwear at an estimated cost of Sh2.6 billion.

In 2012/13 financial year, Sh300 million was set aside for the Ministry of Education to provide the sanitary towels. This amount was reduced to Sh30 million in 2013/14 financial year.

Until 2017, the ministry provided an estimated 568,925 underprivileged girls in public primary schools in 82 districts (now sub-counties) within marginalised and slum areas.

The coming into effect of Basic Education (Amendment) Act in June 2017 guaranteed all girls in puberty age enrolled in public primary and secondary schools, free provision of pads. In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was allocated Sh470 million. This catered for 14, 813, 810 packets distributed to 3.7 million girls during the fiscal year.  A sum of Sh420, 618,057 was spent.

Private schools

There are 9.2 million girls enrolled in primary schools and 4.3 million others in secondary schools, confirms data from 2019 Census.

Although data on girls in private schools is elusive, the current data could suggest that 72 per cent of the targeted girls have not benefited from the State sponsored programme.

In May last year, the Ministry of Health launched Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030) with one of the five targets being commitment to ensure WASH facilities are provided in all households, learning institutions, public places, healthcare facilities, workplaces and correctional facilities.

“Without (access to menstrual hygiene materials, latrines and places to change, safe water and sanitation, and good hygiene practices like hand washing with soap), the school environment is unhealthy, gender discriminatory and inadequate,” states Unesco in its aforementioned publication.

Ministry of Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha announced mid-January the purchase of Sh470 million worth sanitary towels for an unspecified number of girls in public schools across the country.

He said the distribution would begin in the third week of January with each of the benefiting girls receiving a one-off bundle lasting them nine months.

“Each girl will get a collection of (pads for) nine months at once,” he said at Kahundira Primary School in Kiambu County.

It’s, however, unlikely that the girls will receive pads covering the nine-months with the financial allocation.

With the Sh470 million, at least 3.7 million girls will get four packets of the pads out of the 4.2 million needy cases. This will last four months.

In 2019, the then Public Service and Gender Affairs Principal Secretary Ms Safina Kwekwe revealed challenges bedevilling the programme.

“When we started distributing the sanitary pads in the 2017/18 financial year, we gave them out to 3.7 million girls. We spent Sh460 million. We only gave four packs to girls in public primary, secondary and special schools. We had nothing for girls in vocational training and other institutions,” Ms Kwekwe is quoted in a local newspaper article dated September 14, 2019.

She added: “We have been having challenges because the money is not adequate. We need to have more so that girls can remain in school throughout but we have only been able to give them four months’ supply in the past.”

With the new law accompanied with the Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030), it meant, the government sat at the centre of meeting the menstrual hygiene management needs of girls in public facilities.

In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was moved to the Ministry of Public and Gender Affairs only for it to be moved back to the Education ministry, late 2019 following hiccups in tendering and distribution.

From Tana River to Busia, menses remain a taboo topic burying girls in shame

In May last year, we shared a story on the challenges women in Tana River County face during their menses.

Fortunately, period poverty is fast becoming a thing of the past after we covered the story on menstrual hygiene challenges where women dug holes to sit on for hours during their menses.

The story that shocked the world, saw donors from as far as Turkey, Britain and the US march into the county to triumph over the shame of the 21st Century, marking the genesis of a revolution that is fast reinstating comfort to lives of the women and girls in the region.

Menstrual hygiene ambassadors and menstrual cops moved into villages donating countless sanitary towels.

“In the past, we could not even talk about our private parts, sanitary pads were not a language we spoke. We only did what our mothers taught us,"" says Salima Waqo, a mother of three.

Ms Waqo is one of the women who taught her children the traditional way of menstrual hygiene since that is what she knew.

According to her, she learnt about sanitary towels in June after activists started making door to door visits to teach on menstrual hygiene.

""Even my children knew about sanitary towels, but they never shared with me, they were embarrassed to do so,"" she says.

Leila Nuru, an activist and a menstrual cop notes that most women from pastoral communities are not schooled on sanitary towels, and rely on traditional methods, where rags are used or holes are dug in the worst circumstances.

The activist notes that even shops in the remote areas never stock sanitary towels.

""Women in our community are very shy, if they have to buy sanitary towels from a shop, the attendant has to be a woman, or they will send a child,"" she says.

Ms Nuru has started training men from pastoralists’ communities on understanding menstrual hygiene and how to support their children and women through the process.

According to her, in the community where men are the providers, only knowledge is required to sustain the solutions currently being implemented.

However, poverty remains the community's biggest challenge. As a result, the women have appealed to the national government and relative organisations to equip them with re-usable sanitary towels.

They say that unlike the disposable ones, re-usable towels are sustainable, cost, and environmental-friendly.

According to Muslima Godana, an activist, a lot of the disposable sanitary towels have ended up in water reservoirs and the streets, hence detrimental to both the environment and human health.

""The disposable towels need to be done away with as we adopt an alternative solution,"" she says.

Efforts to eradicate menstrual disparity in the county are encouraging, with the county government allocating Sh2 million to support menstrual hygiene.

Kenya Works Organisation among other organisations, distributes re-usable sanitary towels targeting 5,000 girls and women in pastoral communities for free.

In Busia County, many adolescent girls faced with challenges of accessing menstrual hygiene management products admit to having transactional sex for pads.

Ms Mary Makokha, the Director of Rural Education and Economic Enhancement Programme (Reep) says some parents only provide food for their families and ask the girls to look for other basic needs on their own.

“This is happening because of poverty – girls and some women don’t have the financial means to buy sanitary products,” says Ms Makokha, noting that men also take advantage of desperate students, sexually exploiting them before offering money for their basic needs.

The girls accept as low as Sh50 to buy sanitary towels.

“Girls are exposed to boda boda riders, truck drivers, shamba boys and even weird grown up men in the villages,” Ms Makokha adds.

The poverty rate pushes some of the girls to either engage in prostitution or marry young to ease the financial burden on their families.

Ms Florence Opetu* (not her real name), a Form Three student at Murende Mixed Secondary School says she engaged in the business when she could not afford pads.

“One day, I was having my periods but did not have pads; when I stood up, my clothes were stained. The whole class started laughing,” she says.

This really embarrassed her.

“One day while heading home from school, a boda boda rider offered me a lift. I resisted hesitantly but after he persuaded me and assured that it was a mere lift, I accepted,” she adds.

The school girl says she ended up getting into a relationship with the man in his mid-30s.

Period poverty is a widespread problem in the country – and those who cannot afford sanitary pads use old cloths, pieces of blankets and newspapers.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, girls who got free sanitary products at school were pushed to desperate measures and scores became pregnant as they looked for money for pads.

The government failed to extend the services to their homes when schools closed on March 15, 2020, leaving the girls at the mercy of the society.

Meanwhile in Kilifi County, stakeholders and organisations have been in the frontline to boost the National government’s initiative, through the Woman Representative’s office, to provide sanitary towels to school girls.

This is an indication that the sanitary pads being distributed by National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) do not meet the demands in schools.

The Filipino winning souls while ensuring they enjoy every moment of life

As you drive towards South Kinangop, off the Naivasha-Nairobi highway, there is an imposing house on the hill overlooking Lake Naivasha.

The house owner is a Filipino woman who came to Kenya in 1998. Ms Minalyn Nicklin, 56, is a missionary with a big vision and mission; to help poor girls and women in Naivasha and its environs enjoy safe menstrual hygiene management (MHM).

She makes reusable sanitary pads that are environmentally friendly, accessible and affordable, in a section of her house, which she has converted into a workshop.

Disposable sanitary pads are prohibitively expensive for girls and women in Naivasha rural villages. This means that during menstruation, they use old clothes which often leak, staining their dresses and are uncomfortable.

Ms Nicklin wants this to change. ""I believe every journey in a positive direction starts with a single step. Making sanitary pads that are easy to use, inexpensive, and recyclable could be a big help for women.""

Her husband, Mr Peter Nicklin who is a medical doctor and her step son Alistair support her venture.

She says limited access to clean water, proper sanitation facilities and sanitary pads make it difficult for girls and women to manage their menstruation hygienically.

As a result, many young women face considerable physical and social challenges during menstruation, including missing school and missing out on important economic activities.

Ms Nicklin’s venture has support from local partners and individual volunteers from the US.

Her pads are made of cotton with the inside layer made from a nylon-type fabric. They are washable after use enabling users to save money because of a longer utility.

Women and girls who use them say they are comfortable and leak-free.

""I have no fears moving and doing my house chores,"" says Ms Jemimah Musimbi, a beneficiary.

Ms Nicklin says the objective of her missionary work in the country is not just to win souls alone but also make sure the souls enjoy every moment of their lives.

“I have discovered that many poor women and girls in the surrounding villages use old rags, and other unhygienic substances like leaves as pad during menstruation,"" says the mother of two.

This, she says, could lead to reproductive diseases and affect maternal mortality.

""My mission is not just to increase the accessibility and use of clean sanitary pads, but also create job opportunities for rural women,"" she explains.

She has invested in five sewing machines and employed three workers.

‘Period man’ seeking to change men’s mindsets towards menses

He calls himself Period Man! A year ago, 28-year-old Mr James Atito was teaching girls at Kakuma village in Turkana County how to use pads, maintain cleanliness during the menses and manage pain among other things.

He had been contracted to undertake the sensitisation. Then one of the girls stood up and asked him: ""Why do you talk about periods? Are you period man?"" That passed as one of those curious queries. The session ended. Evening came.

As he took a walk around the village in the evening, he noticed a group of seven girls sitting along the paths on the rills. Some sat on the bare soil. Some on animal skins.

""I wondered why the girls were sitting there late in the evening when they should be at home,"" he starts off the conversation.

""I was shocked to be told that they were on periods and that they were forbidden from their homesteads until their periods were over. That was an unimaginable stigma. I felt so sad for them and it got me thinking. I said I must do something to end the stigma.""

His journey back to Mombasa, where he is based, was filled with thought of what he can do different to emancipate women and girls from period shame and discrimination.

After two months of researching through reading publications on periods and web scraping, Mr Atito found a missing voice in ending period poverty – that of men.

""Often men are barriers to women's access and use of family planning. And we tell men to be engaged in family planning but we don't tell them how. It's the case with how girls access and use sanitary towels,"" he says.

To reach men and use himself as an example of a male advocate in the fight towards ending period poverty, he settled for Period Man, an identity that equally identifies with the girl who sought to find out whether he has the monthly experiences of menses.

So who is the Period Man? This is the brand name behind Mr Atito that he copyrighted through formal registration with Kenya Copyright Board.

For the past one year, Mr Atito has run two campaigns on Facebook and Twitter,

#Men4Periods365 and #Men4PeriodsMovement, meant to raise men's consciousness on their role in ending period poverty.

He for instance shares information on period pain and its management, how to make reusable pads - a skill he learnt through apprentice - and maintain menstrual hygiene.

""Men perpetrate period shame and discrimination. My mission is to reach them at the household level and find sustainable solutions. Once we have solutions, we will no longer need to push the government or partners to provide girls with the pads,"" he reckons.

Mr Atito studied finance and accounting.

Period of shame that birthed Janet’s book My First Time

“It was a shocking, frustrating and sad. How is it that we are in 2013 and the girls are using chicken feathers and goats hides?” This is Ms Janet Mbugua’s reflection of a feature on period poverty titled “Period of Shame.”

Ms Janet Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, launched in 2014, to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls.

It was aired on a local TV station in 2013. It featured girls from Marigat in Baringo County who demonstrated how they fitted the non-absorbent goat hides or stuffed chicken feathers in their underwear. They pluck the feathers from a live or slaughtered chicken. While unmarried girls are allowed to borrow the goat hides from their married peers, a harmful practice that exposes them to infections.

One of the girls interviewed said: “It is very uncomfortable. It pricks you. During examination, I write while standing,” added the girl then in Class Seven.

At the time, 90 per cent of the allocation to the sanitary towels programme had been slashed.

Ms Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, born out of the pain and shock she felt when she watched the feature. Since its launch in 2014, Ms Mbugua has used it as the voice to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls.

‘Period of Shame’ was the topic of discussion in her subsequent talk shows. For days, the discussion trended on Twitter.

“People were outraged to the point they were leaving pads for those girls outside our gates of the TV station,” she shares. “And it triggered me, so I asked my boss ‘Can we do something? I don’t feel okay with this just dying as it is. She agreed and I came up with Inua Dada Initiative.”

The initiative, she says, was aimed at pushing the government to allocate the programme more money alongside mobilising resources to buy pads for the girls.

Later, they delivered pads and underwear to about 10,000 girls in Baringo County. Nevertheless, she was not happy about the one-off donation.

The need for a sustainable means to end girls’ inaccessibility to the menstrual products, proper sanitation facilities and information, nagged her. And this is how she ended up registering her foundation in 2014. And later in 2017, opting out of the media.

In 2018, she started compiling content for her book My First Time. The book that launched in February last year, profiles menstruation experiences of 50 girls including those with disability and HIV.

With the book, she purposes, breaking the silence on period poverty and ending the stigma, attached to it. She also features men’s voices.

“Men cannot be ignored in the conversation. They are our biggest allies,” she says.

Her book is bringing changes to how men perceive the subject.

“I’d go to places and fathers could come up to me and say ‘Your book helped me figure out, how to break down this conversation at home with my sons and daughters,” she says.

Ms Mbugua is extending the book to add an addendum on the Pan-African perspective on emerging period poverty issues during the Covid-19 period. The new version will be out in two months.

She says: “Period poverty was blown wide open during Covid-19. Suddenly, schools that were giving pads were closed. Suddenly, the women who were washing clothes to earn a keep had lost their jobs. A lot of girls turned to sex for pads, more than we know.”

She is happy her relentless efforts on social media have resulted in more people engaging in the subject, wrapped as a taboo.

“I posted a picture of my stained pyjamas…there were 10,000 likes and about 1,000 comments. It tells you people want to talk,” she says.

“A few people in the comment section are saying ‘Thank you for just opening this door for us to comment on an issue that is so often a taboo.’…and for me that is a win.”

In the midst of the pandemic, Ms Mbugua has maintained the momentum through virtual activities.

Last year, she held a virtual period party where women highlighted the prevailing challenges and advocated for action from the government. She has earned herself a special friend for her consistent campaign against period poverty; public criticism.

Late last year, her foundation embarked on a sustainable approach of ending period poverty. It entered into partnership with The Pad Project to run a two-pronged pad project in Nairobi County.

The all-female crew bringing prestige to the matatu industry,"Travelling by public means can be a nightmare to many passengers. In an industry perceived to be marred with chaos and uncivilised characters, one would only hope to safely arrive at their destination.

However, when you get to a bus station and are welcomed by smartly dressed ladies who diligently assist you with the ticket booking and even pray for you before you embark on the journey, you certainly want to be sure you are not at an airport.

This is the exact situation you meet at one of Nakuru town’s matatu termini – it is changing the status quo of the matatu industry.

Prestige Sacco, which has been in operation for years, has stormed the industry with its unique style of operation, a total shift from the norm.

With women as its main crew, the distasteful attributes of the sometimes rowdy, foul-mouthed and uncivilised touts is nothing in sight.

The ladies, dressed in red skirt suits complete with hats resembling those of flight attendants, are in full control of transport services, something that has seen the transport company feted for being the best in the country.

The female crew does all the touting, customer care and ferrying of passengers to different destinations across the country.

Ms Grace Njoki, who holds a diploma in information communication and technology is in charge of customer relations. Now in her fourth year working with the company, the 26-year-old’s job is to ensure customers leave the station satisfied, comfortable and motivated.

Once a passenger arrives at the booking office, Ms Njoki welcomes them with a gentle smile, warming their hearts before directing them to the booking office.

“I help potential customers with booking of tickets, direct them to their seats, tuck their luggage safely in the back compartment and ensure they belt up,” she says.

She then ensures each customer has received their cash balances, in case of any, before introducing the trip driver.  What follows is the invitation of a pastor to pray for the journey before the vehicle takes off.

When she was first offered the job, Ms Njoki says she was reluctant as she did not want to be associated with a job that has a negative perception from the minds of the public.

Ms Carol Nduko assists customers in arranging their luggage inside the compartment.

But upon learning their way of operation, she gladly accepted and has since been part of the crew.

“I realised that the customers appreciated our services so much and I started loving the job. I do not regret taking the offer,” says Ms Njoki.

The company named her the hostess of the year 2020. One of her main challenges is dealing with different types of customers, which she says can be overwhelming.

Ms Carol Nduko, on the other hand, is in charge of sales, marketing and customer relations department. A holder of higher diploma in sales and marketing, she says her job involves looking into the welfare of customers.

As a team leader, Ms Nduko handles complaints or compliments arising from the passengers using their vehicles.

“My work is to create a long-lasting relationship between the customer and the company by ensuring they get quality service. I even keep their contacts to follow up on them to know their journey experience,” she says.

Ms Ann Grace Wanjiku is a driver who criss-crosses the country ferrying passengers to different regions. The 27-year-old is a certified driver with more than five years’ experience.

In her fourth year working with the shuttle company, Ms Wanjiku says the experience has been thrilling, especially considering that she is among the few female drivers.

Negative attitude

She notes that doing a job that is dominated by men has not been all rosy as she has had to deal with negative attitude from some men who despise her.

""What keeps me going is my love for the job and the appreciation I get from the passengers at the end of the journey. Most of them congratulate me, including those who had issues at the start of the journey,” she says.

After operating for a decade, the company recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. For the second consecutive year, they were awarded for being the best fleet shuttle of the year.

They received a trophy last month in a colourful ceremony hosted by the road safety agency, Safety Plus Consulting Limited formerly the National Road Safety Agency.

Speaking during the celebration, Mr Alphayo Otuke, the Chief Executive Officer of Safety Plus Limited said the Prestige Shuttle has proved to be an important stakeholder in the government’s efforts to promote safety on the highways.

He said the agency considered many parameters ranging from the manner of operations, company innovations systems such as the Information Communication Technology that enable efficiency and accident ratings among other things, before settling on the winner.

“We need to see all stakeholders play their part in promoting road safety in order to reduce the worrying surge in number accidents along our roads,” said Mr Otuke.

While receiving the award, the company director Mr Steve Muli, who is also the chairman of the Central Rift Matatu Owners Association, said his aim is to change the traditional perception of the industry by offering decent services.

“We promise to maintain our quality standards to be emulated by other stakeholders in the industry. As we begin our second decade, our aim will be to see the matatu industry respected as any other serious business,” said Mr Muli.

The company has invested heavily on customer relations with their focus on the female employees.

Ms Chebet, a regular customer with the service says she has used the shuttles for four years now.

“I live in Baringo County but work in Nairobi, so I travel every weekend sometimes with my family, and I have been using the shuttles. I love the services because I do not need to worry about careless driving,” she says.

Mr Muli says he initially employed men before changing the strategy after four years of poor business. The director says the decision to have women in the crew turned out to be his golden opportunity as business blossomed very fast.

“We were shocked when the high number of customers overwhelmed our staff. We were forced to recruit more women after realising that the customers loved their services,” he says.

"Ending SGBV requires open talks about stereotypes, norms","Sexual violence is not a women’s problem, nor a girl’s problem. It is an entire society’s problem because it affects us all. Breaking down harmful stereotypes and bringing men and boys into the conversation are two of the most important norm changes we collectively need to nurture.

Sexual violence and harassment take place in our homes, public spaces, workplaces, on the streets and in our education institutions. Exposure is heightened in conflict and emergency contexts.

During Covid-19, violence in the home has become what the global community call, the ‘shadow pandemic’. Reports from Kenya’s national helpline that responds to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) has seen a huge spike in calls since the pandemic began.

Early and forced marriage

Women and girls in Kenya often experience alternate but equally damaging forms of SGBV, both mentally and physically, including child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation and femicide. One in three women globally are affected by gender-based violence, and in Kenya, statistics record 45 per cent of women and girls aged 15-49 have experienced SGBV. One in five women have suffered from female genital mutilation (FGM) in Kenya and 23 per cent of the nation’s girls are married before their 18th birthday, while four per cent are married before their 15th birthday.

The exact numbers of rape and sexual assaults are difficult to assert due to reluctance or fear for victims to report it, and inefficiency in addressing the reports adequately because of lack of capacity and resources and sometimes will.

We are daily witnesses to ‘rape culture’, sometimes even silent bystanders. Society has entrenched the use of misogynistic language, the objectification of women’s bodies on screens, indifference to consent, and the glamorisation of violence in advertisements.

Victim-blaming

Victim-blaming, trivialising of rape and the stigma faced by survivors are still far too common. The understanding of mutual consent; that only yes means yes, given freely without manipulation or coercion – is paramount in the prevention and eradication of rape and sexual harassment.

Male involvement in ending SGBV is particularly crucial as many Kenyan communities remain highly patriarchal. As authority figures, men hold more power and influence over decision-making in the social domain and are often considered the custodians of culture. They are in a position to determine the cultural traits, behaviours and social practices that are viewed as either good or harmful.

The socialisation of boys at an early age can have a long-term impact in shifting gender norms. Some harmful traditional notions of masculinity have been identified as the key drivers of aggression among the male gender.

These include expectations of what it is “to be a man,” where boys are expected to be physically strong, aggressive, showing little emotion in order to maintain the tough persona. What boys learn about expectations of femininity and the value of women and girls at home and in the community also shapes their attitudes towards SGBV.

Healthy masculinity

Efforts should aim at engaging men on the dangers of toxic masculinity and internalised gender bias that can be harmful to the well-being of women and girls. By teaching boys about healthy masculinity, as well as the links between gender inequality and violence against women, we can begin to promote positive behaviours and attitudes towards women’s rights, while eliminating harmful gender stereotypes.

The government has clear legislation and policies on preventing and responding to SGBV. The State Department for Gender is coordinating efforts from a multi-sectoral approach to advocate for this cause. President Uhuru Kenyatta has made firm commitments towards the eradication of GBV and harmful practices by 2030 and to eradicate the practice of FGM by 2022. This strong commitment and leadership is a source of inspiration for all actors, including cultural and religious leaders and calls for concerted efforts to stop the violation of human rights.

16 Days of Activism to End Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign calling for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls. During the 16 days, from November 25 until December 10, we call on people from all walks of life to question those harmful stereotypes and norms that perpetuate violence. No further generations must struggle to cope with a legacy of violation.

If you or someone you know has experience some form violence – call the toll-free line 1195 or Childline 116 to report your case and seek support. You are not alone.

 ,"In late March, reports of violence against women began flooding into newspapers and onto TV screens as the pandemic picked up speed around the globe.

With over half of the world’s population living under lockdown, millions of women were trapped with an abusive partner, cut off from extended family and often with reduced access to support services due to Covid-19 restrictions.

For many women, the pandemic equalled a two-fold threat; coronavirus infections and being locked in a confined space while facing danger on a daily basis.

In the past nine months, all types of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic, have intensified, according to the UN.

Now, despite most countries around the world tackling the coronavirus head-on, many of those same nations have failed victims of abuse through inadequate planning, funding and attention.

“Men’s violence against women is also a pandemic, one that pre-dates the virus and will outlive it,” said UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in a statement to mark the annual International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women last month.

“It too, needs our global, coordinated response and enforceable protocols. It too affects vast populations of all ages.”

Worsening the situation is many governments’ failure to include protection for those abused as part of their Covid-19 response plans.

According to data from the UN’s Covid-19 Gender Response Tracker, most nations are not doing enough to address the “economic and social fallout” caused by the crisis.

Less than a quarter of the 206 countries analysed by the tracker treated violence against women and girls-related services as an “integral part of their national and local Covid-19 response plans,” with very few providing adequate funding for related services.

The global response has particularly failed women and girls in refugee settings and, displaced and post-conflict environments, according to a new report from the International Rescue Committee. Local women’s groups were critical to maintaining essential gender-based violence (GBV) support services during the pandemic, it adds.



Set against this harrowing backdrop are ongoing economic pressures and widespread job losses, which have contributed to what the UN are calling a ‘shadow pandemic’.

In April, the agency estimated that for every three months of lockdown that continued, an additional 15 million women were expected to be affected by intimate partner violence.

Last year, some 243 million women and girls experienced sexual or physical violence from their partner around the world. In 2020, reports of domestic violence, cyberbullying, child marriages, sexual harassment and sexual violence have increased globally, added Mlambo-Ngcuka.

The abuse is as global as the pandemic; from Brazil to China, Uganda to Nigeria, its alarming rise has been well-documented.

In the UK, the British government failed to prioritise domestic abuse in its lockdown arrangements and did not provide help for abuse victims fast enough by July. At least 16 domestic abuse killings took place between March 23 and April 12 in the UK, much higher than the average for the time of year, according to the Counting Dead Women project.

Around the world, distress calls to abuse hotlines sky-rocketed, though official data isn’t always clear-cut.

A women's hotline in Uganda reported a more than fivefold jump in the number of average weekly domestic violence cases reported once lockdown started in late March.

The British charity Refuge, meanwhile, reported a 700 per cent increase in calls on one single day in April. But in other places, such as Italy, official numbers decreased.

“Sometimes, reported abuse cases are falling dramatically and you would think that violence is going down, but it’s just the opposite,” Christina Wegs, the global advocacy director for sexual and reproductive health and rights for CARE, told the Washington Post in September.

“The drop is reflecting that women and vulnerable people are not able to report what’s happening.”

In fact, evidence shows that the pandemic has resulted in significant increases in GBV in nearly all countries, according to UNAids, especially for women trapped at home with their abusers.

Data compiled by UN Women in April this year across ten countries, including the United States, Singapore and Argentina, showed a heightened demand for access to women’s refuges and other support services, while shelters reached peak capacity in many places, made worse by the fact that some were repurposed for additional Covid-response programmes.

In the early stages of the pandemic, some countries took steps to respond to the warnings of soaring domestic abuse rates.

Canada allocated $50 million to women’s shelters and sexual assault centres, while the government in New Zealand included preparations in its lockdown plans from the beginning (and have since pledged $141 million to domestic and sexual violence services).

France, Italy and Spain each set up programmes to house people in hotels if existing emergency shelters were at capacity.



In Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are also plans to support organizations running shelters, while in Colombia and Sweden financial resources are being allocated to support GBV survivors.

There has also been action on the grassroots level. Women have been at the forefront of protests over the past couple of months in a bid to draw attention to domestic violence and demand government action.

In July, large-scale protests erupted in Turkey over the killing of 27-year-old Pinar Gultekin, a university student whose former partner was later arrested for her murder.

Gultekin is just one of 278 women killed in Turkey because of her gender since the beginning of the year, compared to at least 474 in 2019, the highest rate in a decade, according to the campaign group We Will Stop Femicide Platform. The final figures for 2020 are expected to be higher, given coronavirus lockdowns.

Meanwhile, feminist group Femen staged a topless protest outside President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in Ukraine last month.

And in Mexico, protests to fight physical and sexual violence have taken over the city, with feminists kicking government workers out of the Human Rights Commission building last month to use it as a makeshift shelter for women fleeing violent homes.

But many fear this could be too little, too late.

“The economics of violence are simple and devastating,” says Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka. “No one gains. Everyone loses, and we have to turn this around. We know what it takes to fight a pandemic. Now we need the will to do it.”

Remember elderly women in campaign to end GBV,"Maria is an 84-year-old widow from Riruta Satellite, a low-income suburb in Nairobi. She is a mother of five children, two sons and three daughters. Her husband died three years ago, leaving her with the family property that included unoccupied land and some rentals.

Shortly afterwards, she shared the property among her children as part of their inheritance and retained a portion as a source of income. Her youngest son was, however, unhappy with the division of property and maintains that his sisters have no rights to the property.

He became hostile and violent towards his mother, intending to directly collect the rent from the rentals. He has now threatened to kill his mother and sisters to take over ownership of the property.

Violence and ageism

Unfortunately, Maria’s story is just one of many. Violence against older women is widespread, with perpetrators ranging from intimate partners, family members, caregivers, and community members.

As we draw to the end of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, an annual international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls, we must reflect on and galvanize action around the need to better protect older women like Maria from all forms of violence and ageism (the targeting of older persons on the basis of their age).

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that one in six older people- those above the age of 60 - globally, were subjected to abuse in 2019. This was spurred by factors including alcoholism and property ownership disputes, among other issues.

Emerging evidence indicates that the abuse has sharply increased in many countries as a direct result of the pandemic.

Covid-19

Consider the containment measures instituted by governments to flatten the Covid-19 curve; the need for social distancing that culminated in the partial cessation of movement and in some instances, full lockdowns, have left, and continue to leave older persons alone, separated from caring kin who would otherwise often check in on them and ensure their wellbeing.

This exposes them to rogue community members, relatives and caregivers who use the opportunity to exercise their control and abuse, particularly against older women.

A report by the Social Science Research Council indicates that Kenya is among the countries reporting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent average increase in sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) amid lockdowns. This harrowing statistic encompasses SGBV against older persons. What is worse is that victims rarely report the abuse for fear of victimisation. A vicious cycle is, therefore, established, fuelled by ageism and sustained by the inaction of the government and communities.

HelpAge International Africa continues to work with communities to support them to recognize and prevent SGBV against older women and help them access safety and response services. This includes access to counselling and legal advice for survivors. We also provide older people with the information they need to seek support in case of abuse.

Violence and abuse

Additionally, we continue to advocate for laws and policies to protect older women from violence, abuse, and neglect. One such law is the Protocol to the African Charter On Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa. This law provides for, among others, the right to property inheritance by older women; their protection from all forms of violence and abuse, including those emanating from harmful traditional practices; and the provision of care and support. Four years since the adoption of the Protocol, Kenya is yet to ratify it, leaving the rights of older persons in the balance.

Ending SGBV against older women will take a concerted effort. The government should ratify and implement the African Union Protocol on the Rights of Older Persons. Additionally, it must fully implement existing legislation that protects the rights of older women, including increasing budgetary allocation towards the protection and promotion of their rights.

Communities must also treat older women with care and respect. Ageing is not an event but a process that starts at birth. It is, therefore, imperative that we collaborate in putting an end to the mistreatment of older persons including SGBV against them.

Tharaka Nithi County devising law to help end FGM,"Tharaka Nithi County is coming up with a policy that will give it legal power to fight Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).The county is among the 22 FGM hot spots in the country.

Speaking to the media in Chuka earlier in the week, the County Gender Executive Ms Sheila Kiganka who is spearheading the exercise, said the target is to help slay the FGM dragon by 2022 in line with the President Uhuru Kenyatta’s declaration.

She said the policy, soon to be taken to the county assembly to be made law, will give the devolved government latitude to finance initiatives to fight the illegal ‘cut’ that is rampant in Igambang’ombe, Tharaka South and Tharaka North sub-counties.

“We have already formulated the policy with the help of other stakeholders like Plan International Kenya and Ripples International,” said Ms Kiganka.

She said without a law, it’s difficult for the devolved government to fight FGM because it lacks the legal framework and mandate.

Outdated culture

She added that the policy brings together various collaborators in the fight against the outdated culture including non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations, Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders and the government to form synergies.

With the law, the county government with the support of the police and the national government will be able to prosecute FGM perpetrators.

Tharaka Nithi Women Representative Ms Beatrice Nkatha said it’s unfortunate some people continue to practice the outdated culture despite efforts by government and non-government organisations to end it.

She noted that the practice is common during holidays, especially in December and urged government officers to remain vigilant in order to arrest and prosecute any perpetrator.

“It’s embarrassing that there are people still clinging onto the outdated FGM practice that has a lot of disadvantages to our girls,” said Ms Nkatha.

According to Tharaka Nithi County Commissioner Ms Beverly Opwora, cases of FGM and other forms of GBV are on the rise in the region during the Covid-19 pandemic period.

Speaking to journalists separately at her office in Chuka town, Ms Opwora said the culprits are not sparing even girls as young as 10 years.

 ,"When Dr Karambu Ringera fell out with the father of her son, she went through a traumatic experience that inspired her current work with orphans and survivors of violence.

Dr Karambu, a communication expert, is the founder of International Peace Initiatives (IPI) that runs Kithoka Amani Children’s Home and Tiriji Foundation that have become a haven for HIV/Aids orphans and victims of domestic and sexual violence.

“I was not ready to be married to him and we agreed to share care time for our son. But when he took the boy for the first time, they hid him from me and refused to tell me where he was. I found my son after two years of searching. I managed to see him through a court order but they hid him again for 17 years. I got him back after the father passed on. I think this experience inspired me into the work I do,” Dr Karambu recounts.

Today, Dr Karambu takes care of more than 100 orphans and vulnerable children having started out in 2002 with those orphaned and abandoned due to HIV/Aids.

She says women and children are the most hit when there is violence, poverty and disease which advised the formation of International Peace Initiatives.

“Out of my experience, I discovered that women suffer most because we live under a patriarchal system. I decided to work with disadvantaged women and children to overcome the systems that were largely made by men to favour men,” she explains.

Dr Karambu says when HIV/Aids was at its peak in early 2000, women whose husbands succumbed to the disease faced psychological and physical violence with their children being abused.

However, she says currently, most of those who seek shelter from IPI are victims of sexual and gender violence.

“Our approach at IPI is transforming the victims through training and mentorship into self-reliant individuals. We work with victims to identify the solution to their problems because such an approach is more sustainable,” she says.

Abandoned

In 2002, while a student in the US, Dr Karambu started working with a group of HIV positive women who made jewellery for sale.

“Most of these women had been neglected and abandoned by relatives due to stigma. Some of them were opting to commit suicide. I could fund-raise to support their jewellery, enabling them to eat well and educate their children. Out of the 95 women we started with, only three have passed on,” Dr Karambu says.

She says Kithoka Amani Children’s Home, provides a safe place for victims of violence besides helping them start life afresh to be self-reliant.

The home, she says, provides vocational skills including agriculture, catering, hairdressing, tailoring, soap making among others besides offering scholarships through university.

“Despite their past experiences, we train the children to believe in themselves and become leaders in their community. Indeed, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the children have been running the home by themselves. They have learnt how to solve their issues such that I concentrate on fundraising,” the IPI president said.

Dr Karambu expressed concern that sexual abuse of young girls and boys has become a pandemic like HIV/Aids in the early 2000 when she started out.

“The biggest concern now is the high number of teenage girls who are pregnant. We need concerted effort to address this new disease in the community and make our society safe for the children,” Dr Karambu says.

"Covid-19 has fanned cases of GBV, report shows","Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country in mid-March this year, cases of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) have been on the increase.

Across the nation, cases of SGBV have increased tremendously with girls and women forming the majority of victims.

Outgoing Chief Justice David Maraga was the first to raise the red flag over the acute increase of sexual violence relate cases filed in courts across the country.

On April 2, Mr Maraga noted that since March 13, when the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Kenya, sexual offences cases constituted 35.8 per cent of cases recorded since then.

A report released by the Federation of Women Lawyers-Kenya (Fida-Kenya) in May, also lifted the lid on rampant sexual violence against women.

The report, released by Fida-Kenya chairperson Nancy Ikunu showed Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa counties leading in GBV in the country since the outbreak of the pandemic.

It also listed Kakamega, Kajiado, Kiambu, Kilifi,Uasin-Gishu, Taita-Taveta, Vihiga, Bungoma, Lamu Siaya, Kitui and Nakuru as having recorded the highest number of GBV cases.

“The nature of GBV cases reported are mostly intimate partner violence, defilement and rape especially in Nairobi and Kisumu. Widow eviction and physical violence by in-laws was found to be prevalent in western region,” the report indicated.

The survey carried out by Fida-Kenya between April 15 and May 3, showed that a total of 289 cases were recorded.

Another survey by Trends and Insights for Africa (TIFA) showed that women are the majority victims of domestic violence at 52 per cent.

"‘Policare’ centres, a beacon of hope for SGBV survivors","Most victims and survivors of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) often blame the police for conducting shoddy investigations impeding their quest for justice.

As a result, many perpetrators of sexual violence go scot-free after being acquitted by courts for lack of evidence.

For a long time, survivors of SGBV and gender activists have been pushing for a one-stop centre to enhance reporting, evidence collection and accountability in sexual related cases.

During a webinar titled Prosecution of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Kenya organised by International Commission of Jurist (ICJ Kenya) 53-year-old SGBV survivor Jacqueline Mutere said the one-stop centres is the only way to ensure proper reporting and collection of evidence in sexual violence related cases.

She also rooted for the establishment of special courts for sexual violence cases just like there are special Lands and Corruption courts to ensure victims get prompt justice.

The campaign by the sexual violence victims and gender activists recently bore fruit after the Kenya National Police Service launched ‘Policare’ which is a one-stop SGBV center model established to ensure survivors of sexual violence can access counselling, medical and legal services from one place.

Integrated approach

Currently, two Policare centres have been set up in Nairobi and Makueni counties with a plan to establish more across the country.

This integrated approach, launched in August to handle SGBV cases is expected to encourage victims to report.

Currently, victims have to visit different institutions in the pursuit of justice which means they have to retell their trauma stories several time.

With Policare, a report is filed in one place where it can be accessed by all relevant institutions.

The model unit by the National Police Service (NPS) is designed to host all professionals involved in delivering justice to offenders while preserving the dignity of the victims plus the evidence they produce is expected to replace gender desks present in all stations.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua noted that the Policare model will be more of a system than a single physical identity intended to meet the dual objectives of improving care and support for survivors and increasing prosecution of the perpetrators.

Toll-free service

Complete with a 24-hour toll-free service for victims, Policare will host victims' interview rooms for women and children, crime records room, a triage, forensic evidence storage room, trauma centres, a room for medical examination and P3 issuance and male and female holding cells.

Public Service and Gender Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia last week while speaking in relation to the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence termed the launch of the Policare as timely.

“I commend the National Police Service for this innovative approach to handling SGBV,” she said.

High Court Judge Teresia Matheka recently observed survivors have high expectations on the Judiciary to dispense justice therefore, convictions are secured as a result of good investigations and strong evidence which she said sometimes lack when it comes to such cases.
