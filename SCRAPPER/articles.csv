Know your cholesterol level to avert heart attack and stroke,"Cholesterol is a term used to describe lipid molecules that deposit on the arterial wall and slowly cause narrowing, distortion or blockage of the blood vessels. The progressive plaque build-up and clot formation can cause heart attack, stroke and blockage of arteries. The deformation of the blood vessels also causes aneurysms of the aorta, which could rupture and lead to serious consequences, including death.

Is cholesterol synonymous with body fat that causes obesity?

No. Indeed, many people are surprised when told their BMI (body mass index) is normal yet the blood cholesterol is high. On the other hand, some obese people may have normal blood cholesterol. The two differ in that the body fat that causes obesity is fat globules stored under the skin when the body cannot process excess fat; whereas blood cholesterol are lipoprotein particles that circulate in the blood and contribute to the development of plaque build-up in the arteries.

Is it true that elevated cholesterol causes heart attacks and stroke?

Multiple studies have consistently shown a clear correlation between the level of cholesterol and the likelihood of developing a heart attack or stroke. There is a clear correlation between the level of blood cholesterol and the extend of plaque build-up in the arteries. In addition, treatment of lipid disorders has been shown to lower possibility of heart attack and stroke.

The likelihood of developing heart attack increases in those who smoke, have hypertension or diabetes and those with family history of heart attack.

What causes lipid disorders?

Lipid disorders arise from a multiplicity of conditions. These include liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes, thyroid disease, pancreatic disorders and genetic abnormalities. These are compounded by unhealthy dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle and genetics. Genetic abnormalities commonly run in families; and patients are particularly advised to have their cholesterol checked if heart attack has affected a first degree relative who is younger than 40 years for men and 50 years for women.

How do I know my cholesterol is elevated?

Many patients with elevated cholesterol are discovered for the first time after coming to the hospital with a heart attack or stroke. This is because lipid abnormalities can stay dormant for many years without causing harm. It is therefore imperative for one to measure their lipid levels in advance to determine if they are at risk. This is recommended annually for those with hypertension, diabetes and family history of heart disease or stroke. Some patients with high cholesterol levels may show some skin abnormalities around the eye or around the Achilles tendon — a fibrous band of tissue that links the muscles in your calf to your heel.

Are lipid disorders treatable?

Yes. The first line treatment for lipid disorders are lifestyle measures. These include exercise of at least 45 minutes for five days a week, and diet modification to avoid foods rich in saturated and trans-fats such as ham, bacon and deep fried fast foods. Foods that could help reduce cholesterol include fruits and vegetables (avocado, olives), nuts, legumes such as beans and lentils and white meat such as fish. Patients are advised to limit alcohol intake and avoid salt.

Physicians will commonly perform a risk stratification to determine the risk to the patient. Risk refers to the likelihood of developing a complication (heart attack, stroke, blocked artery) over the next 10 years. If the risk is high, then drug therapy is beneficial. These medications drop the level of cholesterol in the blood by preventing cholesterol synthesis and prevent further cholesterol deposition in the arteries. In addition, they cause existing plaque build-up to because more stable and less likely to rupture and cause heart attack or stroke. They have been shown to reduce heart attack and stroke in multiple clinical trials

How long is medication for cholesterol required?

Once someone has been diagnosed with a lipid disorder,  treatment is usually life-long. This means applying lifestyle measures and lifestyle modification. It is therefore imperative for the patient and physician to have a candid discussion about first line of therapy (lifestyle modification) and goals of therapy before medication is started. Once medication is withdrawn, the lipid levels rise to pre-medication levels and process of plaque build-up continues.

"Sakaja, Gakuya plot against each other as UDA showdown in Nairobi looms","The postponement of the United Democratic Alliance's (UDA) grassroots elections in Nairobi County has put candidates vying for the position of chairperson in a difficult position.

While the UDA's National Election Board (NEB) said the delay was due to a court order, the two rival camps in the election are making moves that will tilt the scales in their favour ahead of the eagerly awaited polls.

Nation.Africa has established that Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja, and Embakasi North Member of Parliament Mr James Gakuya, who are seeking the chairperson position, have intensified their campaigns.

Gakuyaa-allied delegates have been meeting at Sweet Lake Resort in Naivasha for the last five days to lay down their strategies.

On the other hand, Governor Sakaja has been holding meetings with delegates in Maanzoni Lodge in Athi River, Machakos County since Sunday.

The pro-Sakaja delegates ended their retreat on Tuesday, while Mr Gakuya’s side concluded their meetings on Wednesday.

Former Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga, who is in Gakuya’s camp, said the purpose of the retreat was to come up with a clear lineup as they ahead of the election.

“We have reached an agreement through our internal democratic process. We have picked the 20 members who we will all vote for. We just want to call on the National Election Board to call for election after we finish with the court process,” Ms Omanga said.

Member of County Assembly for Nairobi South Ward, Ms Waithera Chege, who is Gakuya’s campaign manager, said they have the numbers to take the seat.

She claimed that Mr Gakuya is assured of 248 votes out of the total 340 delegates in Nairobi County.

“Politics is about numbers, and you know numbers don’t lie. He (Sakaja) should show what he has on his side,” Ms Waithera said in a phone interview.

According to Ms Waithera, the delegates allied to Mr Gakuya were paraded on Thursday last week during their meeting in Kasarani, and the numbers were the same.

“We are ready for the election and are asking the party to call for the election. Nothing will change, even if they are given one month or one year, the result will still be the same,” she said.

At the same time, Sakaja’s camp is also exuding confidence that they will carry the day.

According to the pro-Sakaja delegates, the Nairobi governor has also already secured 300 votes.

“We just went to a retreat with my delegates, and the numbers will be revealed during the election. Talking numbers is a meaningless game because the votes will be counted,” Sakaja said.

Member of County Assembly for Ng’ara Ward, Chege Mwaura, who is among the lead campaigners in Sakaja’s team said they will easily win the seat.

The two candidates have also been flexing their financial muscles by organizing retreats for delegates in their respective camps.

Court frees minor accused of murdering eight-year-old friend,"A minor who was accused of killing his eight-year-old friend last year has been set free by a Kisumu Court.

The 10-year-old referred to in court documents as N.A.S is alleged to have murdered T.D.O at Andingo Olasi Village in Nyakach sub-County on November 25, 2023.

When the suspect was arraigned on April 8, 2024, the prosecutor sought more time to determine if the age of the minor qualified him to bear criminal responsibility.

On May 21, 2024, a mental assessment was done on the suspect and he was found to be fit.

According to defense counsel, Petty Omollo, the child was under the age of 12 years and therefore was not criminally responsible and could not be charged with a criminal offence.

The counsel submitted that Section 4 of the Children’s Act, 2022 overrides Section 14 of the Penal Code on the presumption of children being criminally responsible if it can be shown that they were aware that whatever they were doing was wrong and prayed that the minor be taken to a Charitable Children’s Home.

However, Prosecution Counsel James Marete submitted that the provisions of Section 221 of the Children’s Act, 2022 only created a presumption which he cited as rebuttal and not absolute.

“The greater benefit is when the child goes to full trial because Section 221 of the Children’s Act can easily be abused,” said Mr Marete.

He added that the issue of criminal responsibility can only be raised after the court has heard evidence by the prosecution witnesses to establish whether the child was capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong and not terminate the case at an early stage.

The United Nations ruled that the minimum age of criminal responsibility should not be lower than 12 years because children under the age of 12 have not yet reached the necessary developmental stages in “emotional, mental and intellectual maturity,” to be held responsible for criminal behavior.

Justice Roselyne Aburili found and held that the minor was not criminally responsible for any act or omission.

According to the judge, under criminal law, it is taken that a child of tender years is not deemed capable of conceiving the thought of committing a criminal offence and acting upon it in the same way as an adult would.

The judge said she was persuaded beyond doubt that the child was under the age of 12 at the material time of the alleged murder of the deceased and therefore not a person in conflict with the law.

“In the end, I find and hold that N.A.S is not criminally responsible for any act or omission. The Information for murder dated March 25, 2024 against the child is hereby rejected and quashed and the subject child is hereby set at liberty,” said Justice Aburili.

The judge added that from the Probation Officer’s report dated May 24, 2024, she gathered that the child lives in a dysfunctional family where he had clearly been abandoned and neglected by his parents.

"More farmers shun banks for loans, go informal","More farmers are turning to informal groups, buyers of their produce, and the Hustler Fund for loans to invest in their ventures, amid rising interest rates on bank loans.

In just two months to May, the number of farmers borrowing from informal savings and credit groups nearly tripled, those taking money from people who buy their produce more than doubled while the number of growers borrowing from the Hustler Fund to put into their farms shot up slightly, a Central Bank of Kenya survey reveals.

The findings on developments in Kenya’s agriculture sector, commissioned last month, show that the number of farmers accessing loans, mainly from banks, dipped since March, with high interest rates coming out as the main barrier.

“The main sources of finance for farmers have continued to be banks, saccos, and digital loans,” the survey notes, indicating that through this year, about a quarter of the farmers said they had borrowed to boost their activities.

“The share of farmers who reported to have used the Hustler Fund to finance agriculture activity slightly increased in May 2024,” the Agriculture sector survey adds, noting that funding sources with the highest rates of rise were informal savings and credit groups, and buyers of farm produce such as coffee and milk.

The Hustler Fund was officially launched by President William Ruto in March 2023 as part of his election manifesto to uplift the lives of poor groups in the country. The fund issues loans of between Sh500 and Sh500,000 to individuals for a tenure of 14 days at an interest rate of eight percent per annum.

Comparatively, the latest CBK data shows that by February the weighted average lending rates among commercial banks stood at 15.88 percent, up from 15.2 percent in January.

The study also notes that with about 82 percent of farmers still relying on rain to practice agriculture and the market remaining highly fluctuating, many are steering clear of borrowing, to avoid being auctioned should they default.

“Similar to what was observed in the March 2024 survey, it was noted that most farmers were reluctant to seek loans because of significant output price fluctuations which makes their incomes unstable even in periods of good harvest. Some farmers also cited lack of collateral as a deterrent to seeking loans, especially in cases where farms were leased,” the survey stated.

It noted that high interest rates remain the biggest barrier to farmers seeking loans, with 57 percent of farmers who indicated they did not borrow citing the factor, up from 35 percent who had in March cited high interest rates as a hindrance to borrowing.

“High interest rates continued to be reported as the most prominent barrier. In some cases, farmers were averse to acquiring any form of credit. They explained that crop growing was a risky activity as it mostly relied on rain which could fail thereby exposing the farmer to possible auction,” the survey noted.

US military denies killing Cuban doctors in airstrike,"The United States military has denied allegations by Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia that the two Cuban doctors under their captivity, were killed in an airstrike in February.

The two doctors, Assel Herrera and Landy Rodriguez, were abducted on April 12, 2019 in a brazen attack in Mandera town.

The airstrike was conducted on February 15, 2024 within Jilib town, Southern Somalia.

The US Africa Command in its latest quarterly report admitted they carried out an airstrike but denied killing the two doctors.

Immediately after the airstrike, the Al-Shabaab group announced that the two medics were killed by the US army.

“On February 17, 2024, the command received one report from an online media source stating two civilians were killed as a result of a US military operation in the vicinity of Jilib, Somalia on February 15,” read the report.

The US Africa Command said it reviewed the available information and in its assessment, the airstrike did not result in civilian harm.

A police officer who was escorting the doctors was killed in the attack that led to the abduction.

The doctors were in a government vehicle on their way to the hospital where they worked when they were taken hostage.

Herrera, was a specialist in general medicine and Rodriguez, a surgeon.

Cuba and Kenya had an agreement to bring in Cuban doctors to help implement universal healthcare coverage and sort out issue of shortage of medics.

The US Africa Command also said it has completed assessments of the alleged airstrikes in Galhareeri in Galmadug State that occurred in January and February. It denied carrying out an operation in the two towns.

US Africa Command takes all reports of possible civilian harm seriously and has a process to conduct thorough reviews and assessments using all available information,” the assessment said.

It added: “The command remains committed to reviewing and assessing any reports of civilian harm.”

The US has supported the Somalia government with airstrikes against the Al-Shabaab and has been providing military training for government troops.

Immediately after the airstrike, the Al-Qaeda affiliate group announced that a US drone struck a house in Jilib, killing the two doctors. It went ahead to share pictures of the dead alleging the bodies were of the two doctors.

Ms Lennea Montandon, a spokeswoman for the US Africa Command then told the press they were assessing the results of their operation.

She said there was no credible evidence that there were any civilian casualties in the strike but they would continue to investigate the allegation by the Al-Shabaab.

Immediately after the news of the killing of the two doctors made headlines, Cuba’s parliament speaker Esteban Lazo arrived in Nairobi, to engage in urgent procedures with the highest authorities in Kenya in “searching for cooperation and clarification” on the possible deaths of the two doctors.

Both Nairobi and Havana have kept the news about the two doctors well-guarded as both chose to remain mum on the issue.

Kenya had attempted to use the Somali clan elders in freeing the two doctors but it was reported the militants bolted out of the negotiations and chose to have the two treat the injured militants.

How Junior Starlets are balancing training and studies in camp,"With a historic Fifa World Cup ticket beckoning, members of Kenya’s U-17 girls' national team are juggling two balls in the training camp.

The Junior Starlets, comprising secondary school students, have for months been delicately balancing studies and training.

The girls have been in training camp since April, preparing for the 2024 Fifa Under-17 World Cup that will be held in the Dominican Republic from October 16 to November 3.

Kenya will host Burundi at Ulinzi Sports Complex in Nairobi on Sunday, in the return leg of the fourth and final round of qualifiers.

Junior Starlets have one foot in the World Cup following a 3-0 victory over Burundi in the first leg last Sunday at Abebe Bikila in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

In the 31-player provisional squad called up by coach Mildred Cheche for the third round fixture against Ethiopia, Madira High School players dominated all positions, starting with goalkeeper Ephy Awuor.

Other players from Madira included Kimberly Akinyi (defender), Brenda Awuor (midfielder), and Valarie Nekesa (striker).

The school principal Mildred Senelwa said they have put plans in place to implement remedial classes for the students in the national team to bridge the learning gap occasioned by their absence.

""It is the first time the players have been out for two months, which has been challenging for us,"" said Senelwa.

The principal said the school always encourages the students to carry their books while on national duty.

“All the footballers at my school are on scholarships. Fortunately, we do not have any candidates in the Starlets squad. The players receiving national team call-ups are great representatives of our school. The achievements boost the morale of their fellow students,"" said Senelwa.

According to the principal, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has also indicated that it will support the girls in making up for lost time in school.

“Upon returning to school, they will have remedial programmes under supervision and will also have additional hours in a day to catch up,"" said Senelwa.

Butere Girls High School in Kakamega County has three players in the Starlets squad, namely Brenda Nechesa (defender), Halima Imbachi (midfielder), and Joy Angela Valencia (striker).

Similarly, Butere Girls High School from Kakamega County is represented by three players – Brenda Nechesa (defender), Halima Imbachi (midfielder), and Joy Angela Valencia (striker).

Kobala Girls and Nyakach Girls were each represented by two players, while Wiyeta Girls, Brenda Girls, Dagoretti Mixed, St. Alfreda Alara Mixed, Magunga Girls, Archbishop Njenga Secondary, and Sunflower Junior High School had one player each.

In addition to the secondary school players, players from Talanta Hela and Chapa Dimba are also part of the team.

Speaking on Monday when he received the team at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) from Ethiopia, the Cabinet Secretary for Sports Ababu Namwamba lauded the schools' contribution to the national team's success.

""A good number of players are students. Schools like Butere, Nyakach, and Bishop Njenga have greatly supported the team. Talanta Hela programmes and the Kenya Academy of Sports have also played essential roles,"" Namwamba said.

However, even with school work to worry about at the training camp, the Kenyan girls have raised the hope of an entire nation.

Junior Starlets are now just 90 minutes away from clinching Kenya’s first-ever ticket to the Fifa U-17 World Cup.

Nigeria and Zambia are also well placed to punch their tickets to the Dominican Republic after winning the first-leg matches of the final round of the qualifiers.

Nigeria thrashed hosts Liberia 4-1 at Samuel Doe Stadium, while Zambia beat Morocco 3-1 at the Heroes Stadium in Lusaka.

Three top teams from the Caf qualifiers will represent Africa at the 2024 Fifa U-17 World Cup, where 16 teams from six confederations will compete.

Why the Supreme Court was wrong about Martha Karua’s EACJ ruling,"The Supreme Court of Kenya (SCORK) has recently declared, in an advisory opinion, that the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) has no legal authority to review decisions of domestic courts of member states.

In the May 31, 2024 opinion, the SCORK said that under the East Africa Community EAC treaty, the regional court cannot review decisions reached by courts in countries that comprise the EAC.

“On the effect of a decision amounting to a merit review by the EACJ of a decision by a final national court such as this one, such a decision would be of no legal consequence,"" the SCORK said.

The advisory opinion resulted from a request by Kenya’s Attorney General (AG).

On December 9, 2022, Kenya’s AG sought an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court of Kenya to determine whether its decisions can be subjected to a merit review by EACJ.

In questions framed by the AG, he asked the SCORK to invoke its constitutional authority under Article 163 (6) of the Kenyan Constitution to determine the legal consequences of such a review (by EACJ) and establish if it impinges upon the sovereignty of the Kenyan people.

The AG also sought the apex court’s opinion on the legal effect of a judgment by the EACJ that a finding of a Kenyan court “did not adhere to legal principles, including natural justice and the rule of law, in a case heard and determined by a national court, including the Supreme Court.”

The AG’s application was sparked by an EACJ judgment in 2019 that Kenya’s courts, including the Supreme Court, violated the constitutional rights of former Justice Minister Martha Karua in her failed legal challenge against her loss in the 2017 Kirinyaga gubernatorial race.

EACJ held that the violation breached Kenya’s obligation under the EAC Treaty and ordered Kenya to pay her Sh2.7 million in compensation. Kenya lost an appeal at EACJ.

Successful suit

Kenya lost two preliminary objection applications seeking to quash Karua’s application on the grounds that EACJ was trying to sit in the appeal of decisions of Kenya’s court yet its mandate was only to interpret the Treaty but the grounds were dismissed.

In the 2022 application at SCORK, Karua was joined as an intervener because the primate cause of the AG’s application was her successful suit at EACJ.

She sought to strike out the AG’s application, citing, among other grounds, that as per Article 163(6) of the Constitution of Kenya, an advisory opinion could only be sought from the SCORK on a matter involving counties.

This objection alone should have terminated the application. But the Supreme Court upheld the AG’s contention that the application involved counties, merely because the issue at hand arose from a gubernatorial election.

This controversial assumption of jurisdiction was not lost on the Supreme Court because, in its May 31 decision, it appears to acknowledge its tenuous grounds by citing its past ruling that SCORK can assert jurisdiction if it was the “perception of the court” that the matter at hand concerns counties.

Several questions arise from that. One is whether SCORK is right in concluding that the issue framed by the AG concerned counties.

The second is whether the real issue that should have concerned the AG is a constitutional question on hierarchy and conflict of laws to be heard at the High Court first.

Could a framing of questions in a different manner have affected the trajectory of arguments and reach the same conclusion?

Does the May 31, 2024 finding affect all other matters referred to EACJ by natural persons from Kenya or does this finding only affect Karua’s case?

Competitive jurisdiction

SCORK is categorical that its judgment applies to all matters filed by Kenyans at EACJ to the extent that they purport to render a merit review of domestic courts.

Clearly the assumption of jurisdiction was the narrowest and weakest ever for the AG appears to be aggrieved by the fact that treaty law and a foreign court are asserting competitive jurisdiction on Kenya’s sovereign institutions.

The AG resurrected a matter concluded and extinguished at EACJ. And the SCORK accepted it as a legal question on weak, inductive logic that does not fit the four corners of Article 163(6). Without a doubt, a different framing of questions would result in a different conclusion.

In summation, SCORK appears fixated with the hypothesis that EACJ is asserting merit review of Kenyan court decisions and acting in appeal.

These are also questions that have been settled at the EACJ and are no longer contentious.

SCORK framed an unnecessary question on merit view but failed to explain what entails this concept.

In accusing EACJ of acting as an appeals court or conducting merit review and usurping sovereignty of the Kenyans state, SCORK dwells much on Article 27 of the EAC Treaty which says EACJ only has jurisdiction over the interpretation and application of the Treaty.

SCORK also argues that EACJ is prohibited from interpretation of national laws of EAC member states.

And the SCORK adopts an interpretation that treaty law is inferior to Kenya’s constitution from the judges’ assessment of that Article 1(6).

Adherence to the rule of law

This part of the Constitution says any treaty or convention ratified by Kenya shall form part of the law of Kenya UNDER THIS CONSTITUTION (my emphasis)

But the judges are silent on the role and place of general rules of international law within the hierarchy of Kenyan laws per Article 1(5).

The regional court, itself, has addressed most of these matters before and settled the law.

It has, repeatedly, ruled against accusations that it is asserting illegal appellate powers and as indicated above the AG’s attempt to raise this motion was defeated in the Karua case.

In this judgment, SCORK and the Kenyan AG appear to be appealing Kenya’s past losses at EACJ.

Significantly SCORK in its judgment makes scant or no reference to Article 6 of the EAC Treaty that enjoins EAC member states to embrace “good governance, including adherence to the principles of democracy, the rule of law, accountability, transparency, social justice, equal opportunities, gender equality as well as recognition, promotion and protection of human and people’s rights in accordance with the provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.”

EACJ has often cited Article 6 (besides Article 23) that compels member states to ensure adherence to the rule of law in the interpretation and application of, and compliance with the Treaty to justify its intervention.

SCORK also does not mention that Kenya signed the EAC Treaty without reservations to Articles 6 and 23, and hence is bound by them.

EACJ’s jurisprudence allowing applications by natural persons is also based on Article 27 of the Treaty, which says the regional court shall have initial jurisdiction over interpretation and application of the Treaty and “such other original, appellate, human rights and other jurisdiction, as will be determined by the Council at a suitable subsequent date.”

Procedural violations

Clearly, member states envisaged an expanded jurisdiction for EACJ but SCORK does not indicate whether an additional protocol was signed to expand EACJ jurisdiction or was rejected.

SCORK reinterprets and Articles 6 (by default) and 27 for the EACJ and member states in a restrictive manner.

It encroaches on EACJ’s interpretive mandate and in a manner that mischaracterises EACJ’s juridical practice and history.

SCORK cites rulings of other supranational courts to demonstrate EACJ cannot review decisions of domestic courts to determine whether they conform to the rule of law.

In the case of Genie Lacayo vs Nicaragua, 1997, the Inter American Court of Human Rights held that regional courts do not “act as appellate court or court of Judicial Review of rulings handed by domestic courts.”

But in the same case law cited by EACJ, the Inter American Court, rightly, also held that it “is empowered to…call to attention the procedural violations of the rights enshrined in the Convention.”

Citing procedural violations in the conduct of a trial in domestic courts or other organs of a member state by a regional court as EACJ has done does not amount to conducting an appeal or merit review.

An appeal ousts the substantive finding of a lower court. In the 2019 case, EACJ made no such decision.

That SCORK is the final court in Kenya is not in dispute. SCORK as an organ of state also must act within the Constitution and law, which is an obligation to Kenyans and to the EAC Treaty.

SCORK should have demonstrated what aspects of the EAC Treaty conflict with Kenya’s laws to justify some of its conclusions.

KRA to pay Doshi Sh2m for raiding its warehouse,"The Court of Appeal has upheld a Sh2 million compensation slapped on the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) over the seizure of documents, files and computers, among other items belonging to Doshi Iron Mongers Limited over a decade ago.

The appellate court said while it was not disputed that the KRA is mandated to ensure that taxes are paid and to take necessary legal steps to ensure that the taxpayers meet their statutory obligations, the same should be done within the law.

Justices Agnes Murgor, Dr Imaana Laibuta and George Odunga further held that the KRA could not legally enforce the tax demand of Sh2.3 billion against Doshi until all records, documents, files, computers, software and everything that was seized from company’s premises between March 2003 and March 26, 2007, are released.

“It is clear from our reading of section 60(9) of the Tax Procedures Act that the appellants can only retain the documents seized for six months. After that, it has to return them to the taxpayer unless the documents or data storage device seized are required for the purposes of any proceedings under the Act or any other written law, the burden of proving that fact falling squarely on the appellants,” the judges said.

KRA had appealed against Justice P.J. Otieno’s decision stating that the amount was punitive yet it was merely fulfilling its statutory duty.

While upholding the Sh2 million damages ruling, the judges said that if in the course of carrying out its mandate the taxman steps outside his obligation or does so in a manner not contemplated by law, the court is entitled to intervene.

The court was informed that during the months of March and April 2007, KRA moved to Doshi's bonded warehouse in Mombasa without any warrants, court order or notice and carried out several raids, carting away files, computers, equipment, software materials and books of accounts.

Doshi said they were informed that the documents, equipment and data, were to be used in investigating claims of tax evasion.

The court heard that the company was diverting transit goods into the domestic market.

Immediately after the seizure, KRA issued a tax assessment and demand for Sh124.7 million on account of diverted exports into the local market.

Simultaneously with the demand, the KRA seized and locked under seal the company's bonded warehouse.

The taxman later revised the demand to Sh2.3 billion and another Sh73.2 million of taxes for the diverted imports and domestic taxes, respectively.

Doshi was forced to challenge the seizure in court arguing that it needed the documents and data to answer the questions raised by KRA.

The taxman returned some of the documents through a consent adopted by the court.

KRA defended the retention of some of the documents stating that it was intended to be adduced as evidence of the commission of economic crimes before a court of law in the course of a criminal prosecution.

“The learned Judge justified the award of general damages on the appellants’ conduct, which undoubtedly caused the respondents tremendous albeit unquantifiable difficulty, loss and damage,” said the judges, adding that it was clear that KRA failed to release all the seized documents and materials even after consenting to do so.

Why petitioners want Harrison Kombe reinstated as Magarini MP,"A voter in Magarini constituency and two non-governmental organisations are seeking to overturn the Supreme Court's decision to nullify Harrison Kombe's election as MP.

In their application to the High Court, Jackline Kabibi, Tribeless Youth and Siasa Place want the order made until the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is reconstituted to declare the seat vacant and conduct a by-election.

The applicants want the Attorney General and the Speaker of the National Assembly to be restrained from declaring the seat vacant unless the IEBC has the minimum number of commissioners to conduct the election.

They want the orders stayed pending the hearing and determination of their petition, which they say is about the IEBC not having the minimum number of commissioners to conduct the by-election or to review the boundaries in accordance with the constitutional timelines.

""The petition is also informed by the Supreme Court order directing the IEBC to declare the Magarini Constituency vacant and conduct by-elections,"" reads part of the court papers.

The Supreme Court had upheld the nullification of Mr Kombe's election.

Mr Kombe's election had been annulled by the High Court on the grounds that irregularities had affected the final result, a decision that was upheld by the Court of Appeal before being appealed to the Supreme Court.

The IEBC and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) were named as interested parties in the case.

According to the petitioners, without commissioners, the IEBC cannot plan for either of these issues, so the unconstitutional state of affairs violates the Constitution.

The petitioners further argue that if the IEBC declares the Magarini MP seat vacant without commissioners to conduct the by-election, it could remain vacant indefinitely and the electorate, as well as the residents of Banisa constituency, would remain unrepresented in the National Assembly.

The petitioners want a declaration that without a minimum of three commissioners in office, the IEBC lacks the quorum to receive or act on the notice of vacancy under Article 104 of the Constitution to conduct the by-election within 90 days or to delimit boundaries.

They are also seeking a declaration that the IEBC's failure to reconstitute itself for over a year has violated voters' constitutional rights and their right to recall their representatives.

Ms Kabibi, Tribeless Youth and Siasa Place argue that Article 89 of the Constitution requires the IEBC to review the names and boundaries of constituencies at intervals of not less than eight years and not more than 12 years.

They also argue that the respondents disregarded the KNCHR's advice in February that the constitutional deadline for the review would expire in March, yet the country did not have a fully constituted IEBC mandated to undertake the exercise, creating an impending constitutional crisis.

The petitioners also argue that the IEBC's status cannot guarantee the electorate of Magarini a free and fair election conducted by an independent commission and that it (IEBC) cannot lawfully implement the High Court order without the minimum number of commissioners in office.

""The less than quorate IEBC cannot receive or act on the Speaker's notification within 21 days of the vacancy as required by the Constitution, nor can it hold a by-election within 90 days,"" the petitioners argue.

The petitioners argue that the delayed delimitation of constituencies violates political rights under the Constitution.

They also argue that the delay violates political and fair representation and, if not carried out in accordance with due process, may result in the marginalisation and disenfranchisement of certain groups.

They also argue that the delayed boundary delimitation also distorts the principles of devolved government under the Constitution.

""Since the population index is one of the key parameters in the revenue sharing framework under the Constitution, the delayed delimitation of boundaries violates Article 201 on equitable sharing of nationally generated revenue,"" the petition states.

The petitioners also want a declaration that the KNHCR's advice and recommendations on matters within its mandate are binding under the Constitution.

They also want an order of structural injunction directing the respondents to immediately reconstitute the IEBC and to report to the court within 45 days of the court's order on the steps they have taken to comply with it.

Women don’t quit marriage easily,"Never say die is the motto of many a married woman in Kenya. Generally, the female species seeks stability for herself and her offspring. Stability to a woman means the cover, the protection that a man’s love and commitment promises.

We are nurturers, carrying life and pulling ninja moves to sustain that life. Childbirth is child’s play, compared to what else a woman can endure to ensure the welfare of her offspring.

That is why many a woman put up with cruelty at the hands of an abusive husband, for the sake of her children. But the day she realises that her children will be more damaged by her martyrdom antics while in the marriage, that is the day that marriage ends.

When you see an African woman opting to seek a divorce, you can be sure that she has been there, served time, and awaiting her medal. A divorced African woman is an oxymoron. We do not just quit on our marriages. If anything, many of us are either rescued by our children, or a life-and-death episode forces us to take stock of our sad existence and finally throw in the towel.

Divorce is a journey of years, sometimes decades before it actualises into a day of packing and leaving. What one deal breaker makes a woman take the road less travelled?

Fear. There is nothing as damaging as a wife being afraid of her husband. We crave protection, which is a woman’s idea of love. There is no fear in love. When the man who vows to love, honour, and protect his wife, becomes the number one threat to her life, she knows she must quit and run, before she turns into a statistic and leaves her children motherless.

Violence, adultery, and other forms of abuse drive fear into a woman. The shock of these acts leaves her disillusioned. She remains in a constant state of survival, often, for many years, before she finally leaves.

She knows fear when he assaults her, and justifies it, by blaming her. When he betrays her, he minimizes her hurt. She dreads his mood. She and the children learn to live on the edge because they cannot predict what mood he will be wearing when he walks through the doors every day. She tries everything to be a good wife. Supportive? She takes loans and hands him everything. She bends over backward to please him. She reads books, subscribes to marriage seminars, and couple retreats, and learns to shield herself and the children from his wrath.

But one day, something gives. Maybe, it is her daughter’s lost look or the last assault at five o’clock in the morning. Or was it the unrecognisable image staring back at her in the mirror? What happened to the joyous, ambitious woman who used to spring up from the bed and smile at the morning sunlight?

""This is not who I am. This is not the mother I envisioned for my children."" She takes a memory tour, back to the last decade, the pain she has endured, the breach of trust on so many fronts. “I am done. With the facades. With smiling when I should be frowning. With laughing when I should cry. With saying yes when I should say no. I am done! With tolerance, prayers, fasting, hoping, waiting, hustling, suffering, needing, with tiptoeing, with whispering. I am done! With putting up fronts, riding dead horses, being a role model, and a good wife. I am done with timidity, with hang-ups, with bitterness, and with conformity. I am done.”

When a woman makes this resolute decision, more so when she decides to find herself, even if that means starting from zero, you are best advised to keep off her path. Even the stars align and the planets commune to point her in the right direction. Her vision is clear, once she starts to rediscover herself. “This is not what I signed up for. I am going to look for that woman who once threw her head back and laughed, heartily.”

She has a vision of the woman she is, just that fear in a relationship that should have been filled with ease had chipped off something from her. “I am that woman who would never let anyone hit, shout at, cheat on, or lie to.” She goes out to protect herself, and her children and prioritises finding herself. After all, you must be lost to be found.

Our fathers speak from their graves,"Our dead fathers often freak us out when they whisper, in the dead of the night, and - what's worse - only we can hear their voices.

Nobody else can hear their voices but us. Not the person we share a pillow with. Not the folks we share a pot of tripe or tipple with. And that's because our dead fathers don't speak audibly. They speak in our fleeting thoughts, which come to us when we're in a fix - or when we're just chilling - and we wonder if we’ll end up like them. Or, if we'll even measure up to the giants they were.

Sure, we fight the morbid thoughts. We put up fights of our lives. We swear we will be better fathers and men. We swear we will do better. Yet, a strange force - and an enticing voice - seems to pull us to the same damn fate which befell our fathers.

Sometimes, they speak to us when we stare at the old pictures we took. They speak to us about the fortitude and courage our fathers had, raising so many children - and supporting extended families - yet never raising a voice to complain.

There are times they remind us about the grave mistakes they made, which caused the family untold grief. Other times, when they speak, they remind us about their great and sacrificial acts, which were taken for granted. Until now. Until it's too late.

Read: How do you tell a child their dad died in crime?

There are times they speak to us about being forgotten and forsaken by one's children and clan. Other times they speak to us about the abuse they suffered. When this happens, we ask ourselves: “Will I end the same way?”

Our dead fathers are speaking to us. Speaking to us about eventualities. Speaking cold hard facts. Their words aren’t meant to scare but to prepare us. Emotionally prepare us for what loved ones and life will throw at us when we reach a certain age.

They speak to us when we replay the conversations we had. We now treat those random conversations like rare gems.

We kick ourselves in the foot because some things, that were supposed to be said, were not said. And so, when our dead fathers speak to us, we know we'll never really get closure. We will have to live with regrets. Or go to therapy. Which, because of our ego, many of us think is a waste of time and money.

Our dead fathers are speaking to us. Imploring us to avoid the mistakes they made. Cautioning to look out for the pitfalls and traps which made them lose priceless jewels.

“I got this, dad,” we swear to ourselves. “I’m good, pops.”

And then we find ourselves trapped in cycles, familial and familiar cycles, which are too hard to break.

“Who would've thought,” we hear our dead fathers sighing.

Our dead fathers are speaking to us. Telling us it's futile to try and turn back the hands of time. Counselling us - through the choices they made - that what we should instead do is redeem time while we're still alive.

One day, our dead fathers will stop speaking to us. That will happen when we join them on the other side of eternity.

But until we transition, our dead fathers will keep speaking to us. Like it or not, turn deaf ears or be attentive like a trained guard dog; our dead fathers will speak to us until our time here is up.

And then - like their fathers did to them - we will speak to our offspring.

Rampaging gangs leave Haiti at risk as hurricane season starts,"Eveline Janvier's teenage son died when he was swept away by floods in Haiti last year and her grief is shot through with the knowledge that this year's hurricane season will likely cause more tragedy in a nation brought to its knees by gang violence.

Janvier 40, lives in the coastal town of Leogane, about 30 km (19 miles) west of the capital Port-au-Prince, where thousands of people have been killed and displaced by fighting between heavily armed gangs.

In Leogane, hundreds of people are still living in damaged homes and tents after the floods that killed 16-year-old Wilner, who Janvier described as a ""very kind, intelligent and respectful boy"".

With US meteorologists forecasting an ""extraordinary"" Atlantic hurricane season in coming months, there is little hope of any respite for those left homeless.

""Our biggest concern is that there's no guarantee that anything would be different should we face similar disasters today, because no serious measures have been taken to minimize the consequences of such catastrophes,"" said Janvier.

Fighting between armed gangs has utterly upended life in Haiti, making it even harder to cope with the tropical cyclones that are becoming more frequent and severe because of climate change.

Major ports have been closed, cutting off key supplies of food, medicine and aid, and intensifying a humanitarian crisis that has plunged about five million people into hunger on this Caribbean island that lies right in the path of hurricanes.

More than 1,500 Haitians have been killed by gang violence in the first three months of 2024, with nearly 5,000 killed last year, and thousands of women have been victims of sexual violence, according to the U.N.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes in Port-au-Prince, and food prices are soaring as gangs extort illegal taxes and block transport.

But worse may yet be to come for the beleaguered citizens of a country that is also regularly hit by earthquakes, including the devastating 2010 quake that levelled Port-au-Prince and killed around 200,000 people.

As the hurricane season gets underway, most Haitians are too focused on day-to-day survival to be able to prepare for possible storms.

""It is already a crisis,"" said Prospery Raymond, country director of a consortium of three NGOs in Port-au-Prince.

Some communities hit by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 - the most powerful Caribbean storm in a decade - are still recovering from the fallout with people still living in tents, he said.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is forecasting up to seven major hurricanes during this year's June-November season - and that terrifies Haitians like Raymond.

""If a hurricane were to hit Haiti, it will have a catastrophic effect,"" Raymond said.

Across Latin America and the Caribbean, 41 million people living in coastal areas - 6% of the region's population - are exposed to life-threatening storms and flooding, according to new data published by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) in May.

Haiti is further exposed as 133 hospitals, 10% of the total, are in low-lying areas.

Emmanuel Pierre, who heads Haiti's National Emergency Operations Center (COUN), said while preparations for the hurricane season are ""well underway"", the ubiquity of armed gangs was impeding efforts to get ready.

A new disaster situation room was set up in June, volunteer-led civil protection groups have been re-activated, and COUN's central warehouse has been stocked with supplies like tents, shovels and wheelbarrows.

Alert systems are being tested, and there are also plans to create two regional hubs to improve the distribution of hygiene kits and food if disaster strikes.

But all these efforts are being stymied by gangs, who control entire neighborhoods, set up roadblocks and impose curfews.

""A very difficult challenge we've been facing is to actually supply centers outside of Port-au-Prince because of armed gangs who occupy the main roads and neighborhoods around them,"" said Pierre.

""We often have to skirt regular roads to avoid contact with armed bandits,"" he added.

In response, COUN officials have been identifying local suppliers in remote areas who will be able to buy food and equipment for them. These suppliers are also helping people to rebuild homes destroyed by previous floods and a tornado that barreled into northwest Haiti in late May.

Another option has been to ""cut a deal with some boat owners and captains"" to buy supplies in Port-au-Prince and then ship them to communities in need, said Pierre.

Daily Survival

At the national government level, hurricane preparations have taken a backseat to other pressing priorities, like installing a functioning government.

Interim Prime Minister Garry Conille, who was sworn in on June 3, has to select a new cabinet and get a transition council to agree on how to improve security and restore control.

Restoring political stability is a priority for the U.N. agencies and other local and foreign aid groups trying to deliver food and other essential items in areas controlled by gangs.

""Security challenges do affect our work, our ability to reach communities,"" said Abdoulaye Sawadogo, head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)in Haiti.

""We work with local authorities, community leaders, religious leaders and some influencers in the areas to facilitate safe passage and ensure humanitarian access,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a written response to questions.

Despite the security challenges, NGO head Raymond said some aid groups have managed to carry out refresher courses and training for volunteers from the civil defense force to prepare for potential hurricanes.

Many local communities are taking the lead in preparation activities and have identified churches and schools that can be used as shelters during a hurricane, he added.

But the country's state of permacrisis means people like Janvier know they are at the mercy of the winds when they start roaring again on an island already laid low by unrelenting cycles of conflict and disaster.

""In our community people worry about a problem only while it's happening,"" she said. ""Otherwise, people continue to go about their business, until the next disaster.""

"Lawmakers question CUE over 277,000 first year slots in varsities","Members of Parliament have questioned how the Commission for University Education (CUE) approved over 277,000 openings in public and private universities during the 2024-2025 student placement cycle.

Specifically, the National Assembly Committee on Education questioned how the CUE allowed Kisii University to admit 16,464 first-year students despite questions on the number of academic staff and infrastructure to accommodate such a population. Its declared capacity is higher than older and more established universities, a fact that alarmed the MPs.

Documents tabled before the committee on Tuesday, June 11 indicated that Kisii University has the highest number of vacancies followed by Kenyatta University.

The Head of Programme Accreditation at the CUE, Marcela Mwaka, was at pains to explain how Kisii University was allowed to declare that they have a capacity to accommodate 16,000 students despite the shortcomings.

Universities declare their capacities to the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Series (KUCCPS), after which the CUE approves them after checking whether the institution has the right infrastructure to accommodate the capacity declared.

Infrastructure available

Ms Mwaka could not clearly explain to the lawmakers the infrastructure available at the university that caused the CUE to give it the green light to admit such a huge number of students.

Read: More than 500,000 KCSE learners not placed in colleges

The CUE is responsible for accrediting university programmes and the number of academic staff and infrastructure are key determinants. The KUCCPS has placed 7,772 students at Kisii University, the third highest number among public universities.

“We go through the data provided by the universities by considering the previous data it provided, then we do validation based on capacity and available programmes,” Ms Mwaka told MPs.

She said Kisii University has 82 bachelor’s degree programmes and 317 members of academic staff. It has three full professors, 11 associate professors, 31 senior lecturers, 135 lecturers, 75 assistant lecturers, 58 tutorial fellows and four ‘others’.

According to the CUE, the university has 91 lecture rooms, seven computer labs, three science laboratories, an anatomy laboratory and chemistry, biology and physics laboratories. MPs criticised the CUE allowing Kisii University to admit a high number of students despite lack of capacity.

“How many lecturers are needed to adequately attend to 16,000 students? What is the size of the university? How many lecture rooms are available for learning?” committee chairperson Julius Melly posed.

The MP said the committee will physically visit the university alongside others to confirm whether what the commission has indicated is the true position on the ground.

16,000 first year students

“This committee will do a physical check-up before writing our report,” Mr Melly said. He added that the committee will schedule a meeting with the CUE next week to discuss the carrying capacities of local universities.

Siaya woman rep Christine Ombaka and Kabondo Kasipul MP Eve Obara also questioned the ability of Kisii University to admit 16,000 first-year students.

“This is 16,000 is just the cohort in the first year, there are also other students that need to be taught. How is this possible?” Ms Obara asked. Prof Ombaka sought to know the workload each lecturer with such a population.

“I have been in the university lecture halls and I can tell you that there are some lecturers who are under-teaching while others are over-teaching,” he said.

Kitutu Masaba MP Clive Gisairo pointed out that Kisii University has no capacity to accommodate the 7,772 students it has been allocated , much less the 16,000 declared capacity.

“If the university declared 16,000 places, then it is not possible. Even if we go with the 7,000 that it has been allocated, it means at any given time, the university will have 43,000 students on campus. Those numbers don’t just add up. You will need to break some sweat to convince us,” Mr Gisairo said.

Documents tabled before the committee on the placement of students to public universities indicate that Kisii University has the highest capacity at 16,464, followed by Maseno University (10,821), University of Nairobi (10,211), Karatina University (9,180), and the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (8,903).

Others are Masinde Muliro University (8,724), Moi University (8,646), University of Nairobi (8,604), Chuka University (8,270) Tom Mboya University (7,536) and Egerton University (7,400).

Can normal chores be mistaken for illegal child labour?,"Dear Eric,

I am a firm believer in Christianity. The Bible expects parents to guide and mould children into responsible citizens. This includes ensuring they understand work, and the discipline and satisfaction of accomplishing a task. Yet, I hear everyone saying that children must not be subjected to labour. What does this mean in law?

Maureen.



Dear Maureen,

On June 12 every year, the world unites to challenge child labour everywhere. It is the day to celebrate child development milestones by connecting and consolidating the voices of children, advocates, parents, caregivers, policymakers, communities, civil society organisations, and governments to condemn child labour in all its forms and degrees. The journey that many children have endured to realise the four pillars that define their rights within the frames of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) has primarily been achieved owing to the strong presence and implementation of the law.

While the International Labour Organisation has for the longest led this conversation, several other global, regional, and local organisations have consistently advocated for contextualised children-centred social and economic systems to protect children from exploitative and illegal labour.

1989 is when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 44/25 in November, establishing the CRC as a comprehensive statement on children's rights partly to entrench mechanisms to help world nations notice and depart from systems, laws, cultures, and attitudes that disregarded incidents of grave injustices faced and experienced by children.

Currently, about 218 million children aged between 5 and 17 around the world are engaged in child labour, hence deprived of their childhood.

Kenya is seen as a premier nation regarding children's matters. Our Constitution's Article 53, in its entirety, promotes and protects the rights of children to be children. Clause 2 defines the bare minimum of the intentions, processes, outcomes, and anticipated experiences by emphasizing that the child's best interests are paramount in every matter.

Section 18 (1) of the Children's Act of 2022, which was an upgrade of the 2002 version to be aligned with the Constitution, demands that every person not subject a child to any form of child labour, domestic servitude, economic exploitation, or any work or employment which is hazardous, interferes with the child's education, or is likely to be harmful to its health, physical, mental, moral or social development. In Sub-section (3), it is warned that no person shall use, procure, or offer a child for slavery or practices similar to slavery, including begging, debt bondage, servitude, forced or compulsory labour, or provision of personal services, whether or not for gain.

The warning in Section 18 of the Children's Act finds its practicality by the threshold set in Article 53, Clause (1) Paragraph (d) of the Constitution that endows the state, parents, and society the responsibility to ensure that children's rights to protection from abuse, neglect, harmful cultural practices, all forms of violence, inhuman treatment and punishment, besides hazardous or exploitative labour not be compromised. Paragraph (e) emphasises this by commanding every mother and father of a child, notwithstanding the origination and nature of their parental relationship, to ensure care and protection, which must include equal responsibility of both to provide for the child, irrespective of their marriage status and station.

Article 28 of the Constitution gives every person the right to inherent dignity. This right is only realisable for children, just+ as any other person, if other aspects of their development are contemplated and provided as part of the bigger whole. In this context, the state in Article 10, within the commands of Article 53 Clause 2, is expected to exercise governance to create and sustain social justice, human dignity, equity, inclusiveness, equality, human rights, non-discrimination, and protection of the marginalized.

Statistics indicate that 1.3 million children in Kenya are subjected to child labour for various reasons, that are systemically entrenched. It is often attributed to pervasive cultural practices or poverty that is either chronic or caused by the immediacy of a caregiver or breadwinner losing their power to provide necessary primary care. Financial uncertainty remains one of the biggest challenges, but in some scenarios, the absence of fundamental rights infrastructure, such as schools, tends to compound their predisposition to exploitative and circumstantial labour.

Since it has been known to be catastrophic for children engaged in child labour, the government under Article 2 Clause 5 and 6 is expected to live and uphold its commitment to international treaties, conventions, and other binding agreements. Specifically, it must live up to the promises and commitment made under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter for the Rights and Welfare of Children, and the Sustainable Development Goals.

MPs demand new revival strategy for limping KQ,"Members of Parliament have ordered the national carrier, Kenya Airways, to draw up a fresh recovery plan that will also show how taxpayers will recover billions of shillings spent over the years to keep the airline afloat.

The Debt and Privatisation Committee of the National Assembly gave the national carrier a one-month deadline to submit the report. This (deadline) will be upon adoption of the directive by lawmakers.

Kenya Airways has over the years been heavily leaning on taxpayers for bailouts to pay loans and fund operations, with the expenditure crossing the Sh100 billion mark in four years.

The airline remains in the red financially even as it narrowed losses to Sh22.6 billion in the year ended December, down from Sh38.2 billion a year earlier.

“Within 30 days of the adoption of this report, Kenya Airways PLC should submit to the National Assembly, a realistic and comprehensive report on its turn-around strategy and measures in place to replenish the public resources utilised in the payment of the guaranteed debt, cash bailouts, and expenses relating to the debt assumed by the National Assembly,” says the committee.

Read: Treasury slashes Sh10 billion from KQ bailout

Demands for a fresh strategic plan come as KQ pursues a potential strategic investor while the government is also keen to dispose of the airline in a bid to end reliance on taxpayers for handouts. The National Treasury spent Sh17.4 billion between July last year and March to service a debt that it had guaranteed KQ from a US lender. This is in addition to Sh83.1 billion spent on the loan and capital injection to the airline between July 2020 and June last year.

KQ tapped a $641.49 million (Sh83.41 billion) 12-year-loan from Citi Bank and JP Morgan in 2017, before the Private Export Funding Corporation of the US (Pefco) took it over, with the US Exim Bank and the National Treasury joining as guarantors.

Kenya Airways took up the loan to finance purchase of seven aircraft and an engine but failed to fully service the debt due to cash flow challenges linked to disruptions blamed on Covid-19 pandemic. The Treasury’s guarantee covered $525 million (Sh68.3 million), which is now being serviced fully until maturity by the taxpayer after the government converted the guarantee to external commercial public debt.

A string of losses has forced KQ to cling on to the Treasury for financial support in a bid to remain afloat, bailouts that have attracted criticism even as the government mulls a way out for the airlines.

The National Treasury had earlier told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it expected KQ to get a strategic investor by the end of June 2024.

More students opt for private universities,"A total of 18,557 students applied to be placed in private universities by the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS), an almost double increase from the number placed last year.

Last year, 9,622 students were placed in private universities. According to data released by the KUCCPS on Tuesday, June 11, private universities had a cumulative declared capacity of 57,322 vacancies and therefore achieved a 32 per cent placement.

Under the higher education funding model introduced last year, students can choose to study either in public or private universities.

Placement is usually by choice and merit. However, those who choose private universities do not qualify for government scholarships but can apply for student loans.

In the private universities category, Mount Kenya University received the highest number of students (3,226). The university had declared a capacity of 6,103. Apart from the placement by KUCCPS, private universities also admit students directly.

The other top-five universities include KCA University (2,074), Zetech University (1,703), Kabarak University (1,653) and Catholic University of East Africa (1,218). According to the document, other private universities with a high capacity to admit students include KCA University (5,911), Zetech University (4,140), Daystar University (3,746), St Paul's University (3,450) and Kabarak University (3,430).

However, some universities proved unpopular with students and attracted low numbers of applicants. Only one student was placed to the International Leadership University despite having declared a capacity of 300 students. The Management University of Africa declared a capacity of 750 but was allocated 12 students only.

Other universities with low placement numbers include Pan Africa Christian University (14), Marist International University College (28) and Islamic University of Kenya (48).

Can’t breathe: Why thousands of Kenyan patients are dying,"A new report by the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) has warned that increasing input costs in the production and distribution of medical oxygen is the reason the country is losing thousands of patients who are in dire need of the life-saving commodity in public health facilities.

The study was done in eight counties in Nairobi, Eastern, Rift Valley, Nyanza, Western, Coast, North Eastern and Central parts of Kenya.

According to the researchers, most critically ill patients in the country requiring specialised ICU or HDU care are referred to Level 5 hospitals or the national referral hospitals as the lower levels of the health system, from health centres to dispensaries hardly have any access to medical oxygen.

In April last year, President William Ruto flagged off 20,620 medical oxygen cylinders to aid counties in what he said was transforming the healthcare system.

President Ruto then announced that the Global Fund through Amref Medical had donated funds amounting to 41.7 million dollars to support oxygen supply and comprehensive infrastructure improvement.

""This covers refill of compressed and cryogenic oxygen, acquisition of tanks and cylinders, installation of high volume Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants and the piping and installation of manifolds as well as oxygen outlets to health facilities,"" the head of state said.

However, APHRC researchers told Nation that their findings show an increase in tariffs on electricity and fuel prices as well as over-reliance on imported cylinders as it exposes purchasers to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and disruptions in the global supply chain is making the cost of medical oxygen unbearable.

The researchers were also shocked to find that a year later after President Ruto’s promise, the country has only 70 PSA oxygen plants.

Medical oxygen

“Most of these facilities have inpatient wards but not all have a regular supply of medical oxygen, with many of them relying on the county teaching and referral hospitals to supply them via oxygen cylinders.

Notable innovations with the potential for replication and scalability include the creation of a WhatsApp forum in one county to facilitate the collation of a weekly oxygen consumption report from all health facilities within the county,” they said.

The report notes that 89 percent of the 70 PSA plants are not operating at optimum capacity due to obsolete technology, lack of capacity to regularly maintain and service plants, failure to factor in population increases in planning and historical failure to list oxygen as an essential medicine.

Read: Hospitals to benefit from Sh100m oxygen plants

The study further established that Kenya has only 239 medical engineering technologists and 256 medical engineering technicians bringing this to a total of only 495 experts.

“Nairobi has 28 medical engineering technologists, Eastern-43, Rift Valley-33, Nyanza-13, Western-25, Coast-38, North Eastern-3, Central-19 while at the national level, we have only 37,” the lead researcher told Nation.

“Nairobi also has only 4 medical engineering technicians, Eastern has 49, Rift Valley-71, Nyanza-9, Western-11, Coast-68, North Eastern-4, Central-19 while at the national level, the country has 21,” she said while urging county and national government to prioritise making medical oxygen available in all health facilities.

The study which was done in seven counties around the country established that the predominant form of medical oxygen is produced via pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, given the relative affordability of the initial installation costs of PSA technology compared to medical liquid oxygen (LOX).

PSA plants

They however cautioned that PSA plants incur heavy routine operational and maintenance costs.

“An overall assessment is that at least the county teaching and referral hospitals (Level 5) have a more or less adequate supply of medical oxygen, based on the presence of intensive care units (ICUs) and high dependency units (HDUs) which require regular and predictable supply of medical oxygen,” the report noted.

This means that the impending withdrawal of donor funding and subsequent uptake of these costs by the county governments coupled with rising input costs raises concerns about the potential transfer of these expenses to patients.

It is why experts are now concerned that the convergence of factors such as limited credit access and an unfavourable business environment create significant obstacles to the establishment of local enterprises and facilities for oxygen production and manufacturing of oxygen consumables.

While releasing the findings of their study done in all counties around the country on Monday, Maurine Ng’oda who is the lead researcher highlighted that to cover the increasing expenses associated with changes in input costs, gas-producing companies have found it necessary to raise the prices of their products.

She pointed out that the establishment of PSA plants involves substantial expenses and significant upfront investments.

Pending bills

“Medical oxygen suppliers in Kenya have also reported delays in receiving payment for their services, thereby contributing to the mounting pending bills within the health sector,” she told Nation in an interview adding that medical oxygen continues to remain neglected and receives little priority in county budgets.

The researchers explain that despite Covid-19 highlighting the critical importance of medical oxygen, it has remained largely un-prioritized by county governments.

For some of the counties, medical oxygen projects are occasionally referenced in the Annual Development Plans (ADPs) and County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) while for most of the counties, medical oxygen is not budgeted for as it is currently funded by donors such as Amref Health Africa, they pointed out.

Ms Ng’onda said that health financing in the country is primarily through government funding and out-of-pocket expenditures.

“While donor funding has played a significant role (58 per cent) in Kenya’s health sector development budget, a concern within the health sector is the withdrawal of donor funding - anticipated that more than 30 programs will have to transition to domestic financing by 2030,” she said noting that health sector budgets at the county level make up a substantial portion of the total budgetary allocation which is approximately 24 per cent of the counties’ total budget.

According to the findings, current expenditures account for a greater proportion of the health sector allocations (89 percent), leaving little fiscal space for development expenditures such as the purchase of medical oxygen.

At the national level, recurrent expenditures still account for a greater proportion of the health sector expenditures despite the increases in the wage bill.

APHRC also highlights that apart from inadequate staff, health institutions across the country have inadequate knowledge and technical expertise required for the running and maintenance of medical oxygen equipment and plants.

The researchers now urge the national government to urgently increase the level of investments towards extending and increasing medical oxygen infrastructure.

“This should be done with equity in mind, so that far-flung rural counties are not overly disadvantaged, nor the more populous counties under-served by available medical oxygen services,” Ms Ng’onda said.

They are also of the view that investments in extending electricity connection to health facilities at the appropriate voltage must be prioritised.

Read: Kenya’s big oxygen plants lie

“Some facilities are stuck with equipment they cannot operate because of low electrical power voltage should be prioritized.

This is why they are of the view that a national plan or roadmap on medical oxygen is urgently needed to specify the measures and investments that the national and county governments will take to ensure that gaps in the production, supply and utilization of medical oxygen are addressed.

APHRC urges the government to review its policy on taxation so that it is aligned with low investments in medical oxygen.

“The taxation policy should encourage, rather than stifle investments in medical oxygen equipment and other supplies.

A major recommendation in this regard is zero rating of all equipment and accessories bought by or supplied to public health facilities for medical oxygen,” they highlight.

What is the cost of medical oxygen in Kenya?

It costs about Sh108 million to set up an oxygen plant in the country and this includes the plant house, cylinders, personnel and trucks.

The price of 6.8 cubic metre cylinder of oxygen (a “J” cylinder) enough to treat an adult for roughly a day including transport costs is Sh2,500 though this varies from one facility to another.

However, according to Air Liquide, the comparison of prices between countries varies because production costs vary.

Additional costs can include a cylinder deposit fee of about Sh40,000, a monthly cylinder rental fee of about Sh2,800 as well as paying to transport cylinders to the gas companies depot.

In 2022, the Ministry of Health disclosed that medical oxygen availability in public hospitals around the country was as low as 16 per cent.

“In a recent survey of emergency care centres across the country, over 30 per cent of the facilities did not have a regular supply of oxygen.

Close to 90 per cent of those with oxygen did not have piped oxygen in the emergency department and delivered oxygen directly from the tanks to the patient,” the government said.

Access to Medicine Foundation, pipeline intra-hospital oxygen distribution networks are helpful to supply oxygen at high pressure to equipment such as anaesthetic machines and ventilators or directly connected to patients with a flow-meter and tubing.

The experts add that a key advantage of pipeline systems is that they allow the distribution of oxygen to multiple patients simultaneously and obviate the need for handling and transporting heavy cylinders between hospital wards.

Pump prices to sky-rocket on plan to raise fuel levy to Sh25,"Motorists will dig deeper into their pockets to fuel their vehicles if MPs approve a proposal to increase the Fuel Levy charge from the current Sh18 to Sh25 per litre.

Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen wants the Finance and National Planning Committee to increase the fuel levy charge by Sh7 per litre. It was last reviewed in July 2016.

Mr Murkomen said the expected revenue from the increase of fuel levy by Sh7 per litre will amount to Sh115 billion.

The government currently collects Sh83 billion from the fuel levy. The government targets to collect an additional Sh32 billion if the fuel levy is increased from Sh18 to Sh25 per litre.

Mr Murkomen said the financing gap for road maintenance over the five years (2023 to 2027) is Sh315 billion against the projected Road Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF) collections.

He said this will likely increase the maintenance backlog over that period which stood at Sh727 billion as of 2022.

Mr Murkomen said an increase in fuel levy will generate enough resources for the construction and repair of roads across the country.

Read: Counties bag Sh10.5bn from fuel tax for road upgrades

“It is concluded that increasing the fuel levy charge from Sh18 per litre to Sh25 per litre yields a revenue outcome which is consistent with halting the increase in the maintenance backlog,” Mr Murkomen said.

“When the current fuel levy rate of Sh18 per litre was established in 2016, the pump price of petrol in Nairobi was Sh95. As at May 2024, pump price is Sh194 while fuel levy remains at Sh18 per litre. This difference illustrates the loss of purchasing power of the fuel levy over time due to inflation.”

Mr Murkomen told the committee chaired by Molo MP that currently, the Road Maintenance Levy Fund receives collections from the Fuel Levy and Transit Tolls. The Road Maintenance Levy Fund is managed by the Kenya Roads Board (KRB).

Mr Murkomen is seeking to increase the Fuel Levy through the Finance Bill, 2024. He appeared before the committee to provide final submissions on the Bill.

“As mentioned earlier in this brief, the quantum of fuel levy per litre was last amended in 2016. It is proposed that consideration now be given to reviewing the current quantum of the fuel levy,” Mr Murkomen said.

He told MPs that there are emerging challenges in road maintenance including a gap between maintenance needs and the available resources, which affects the road network of all three agencies.

He said there is an absence of a mechanism to guarantee the portion of the funds allocated annually to rural roads under the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) is used to maintain paved rural roads.

“The effect of the above gap between needs and resources is that excessively delayed maintenance is now adversely impacting road conditions, a pattern that is projected to accelerate unless resolved,” Mr Murkomen said.

“In 2016 when the fuel levy charge was last adjusted, the length of paved roads nationally was 16,600 kilometers. By 2024, the length of paved roads has increased to 25,411 kilometers.”

He said the cost of maintenance of paved roads is significantly higher than for the same roads prior to being paved.

Road maintenance gap

Mr Murkomen said the road maintenance gap is anticipated to increase further in the near term due to the existing road maintenance backlog that continues to increase due to deterioration on account of neglected maintenance.

Baringo North MP Joseph Makilap demanded to know the net effect of increasing the fuel levy by Sh7 on the cost of goods.

Kigumo MP Joseph Munyoro asked the Ministry to consider a percentage of fuel levy instead of increasing the amount by Sh7 per litre.

“We have a motor vehicle tax of 2.5 percent. We have eco levy on batteries. You now want to increase the fuel levy Sh7. How are all these levies going to affect the cost of transportation?” David Mboni, the MP for Kitui Rural said.

Hunter Biden found guilty. What comes next?,"A jury on Tuesday found US President Joe Biden's son Hunter guilty of making false statements on a gun background check and of illegally possessing a firearm. Here is what happens next.

Will hunter biden be incarcerated?

Hunter Biden is facing a maximum of 25 years in prison, but the sentencing guidelines for illegally possessing a firearm, Hunter Biden's most serious offense, is 15-21 months and most offenders get less than that. He could also serve multiple sentences concurrently.

Biden did not use the firearm in committing a violent crime, has no record and has been complying with terms of his pretrial release, including monthly drug testing. Those will likely be mitigating factors and legal experts said Hunter Biden may not be incarcerated.

When will Hunter Biden be sentenced?

US District Judge Maryellen Noreika set no date for sentencing.

Defendants who are found guilty in Delaware federal court are typically sentenced within 120 days of their conviction. That would place it no later than about a month before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Hunter Biden will first be interviewed by probation officials, who will prepare a confidential report laying out a range of penalties based on federal sentencing guidelines.

Prosecutors and defense lawyers will respond to the report with their own recommendations, and the judge overseeing the case will hold a hearing before making a decision.

How might Hunter Biden appeal?

Hunter Biden's legal team made three arguments to dismiss the case prior to trial, and could raise those issues again on appeal.

They argued the gun law was unconstitutional following a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 that expanded gun rights, that the case was politically motivated and that a plea deal Hunter Biden struck last year remains in effect even though prosecutors rescinded it.

His lawyer Abbe Lowell said in a statement they would ""vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter.""

Remaining tax cases

Hunter Biden still faces a trial in September on charges of violating tax law. Having been convicted once, he could face a greater sentence if found guilty again.

Hunter Biden faces 17 years in prison if he is found guilty on the tax charges, according to the Department of Justice, though such a steep sentence would be highly unlikely.

"'Mummy, I'm still fighting': How Njambi Koikai's death exposes the gender pain gap","Has your pain ever been ignored by a doctor, what happened? This is the question I posed to women in my circles when I thought of writing about the gender pain gap, which refers to healthcare discrimination where women's pain is dismissed as normal and often overlooked.

A friend who sought anonymity told me this in response to my question: “I had serious back pain and couldn't even walk. For two weeks, this doctor kept telling me it was just period pain and that it would clear up on its own. But the pain persisted, and I went back and insisted that something was off. The doctor gave me Buscopan, a painkiller, and told me it was all in my head.

Read: All about Endometriosis, the beast Njambi Koikai battled

“Then I woke up one morning and couldn't walk. That's when I went to a specialist at one of the major hospitals in Nairobi, who sent me for an MRI scan. It turned out I had two prolapsed discs that needed surgery. I recently underwent a six-hour surgery and I’m typing this from my hospital bed. I wish doctors would take women more seriously when they say they are in pain.”

Her experience was consistent with research findings about women's pain.

A 2001 University of Maryland study, The Girl Who Cried Pain: A Bias against Women in the Treatment of Pain, found that women experience and report more frequent and intense pain than men. Despite this, women are less likely to receive effective treatment for their pain compared to men.

In her 2021 Engage Talk titled ""Mummy, I'm Still Fighting,"" Njambi Koikai recounts starting her periods at 13 and not being warned about the severe pain that would come with it and follow her all through her adulthood. She called it “apocalyptic pain”.

The pain was so intense that her concerned mother and grandmother took her to a gynaecologist when she was 15. The gynaecologist dismissed her pain as normal and said it would go away once she had a child, leaving Njambi, an aspiring university student, confused about when she was supposed to have this child.

After years of misdiagnoses and unbearable pain, she was finally diagnosed with endometriosis, a chronic pain condition that the World Health Organisation describes as a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can cause severe pain in the pelvis and make it harder to get pregnant.

Koikai spent most of her teenage and adult life battling against excruciating pain but eventually lost the battle at 38, on June 3, 2024. I hope her death will serve as a wake-up call to the gender pain gap and that her legacy as a fighter against endometriosis will be honoured by the government she begged for help from on her deathbed.

Parents left in the lurch as learners sent home for fees,"A move by high school principals to send students home due to non-payment of fees for tuition and remedial classes has left parents in the lurch.

The demand for remedial fees comes despite a government ban on remedial classes, with principals insisting that it is meant to boost education standards. They also say that there's no money to run the institutions due to delayed disbursement of capitation funds.

Read: The sham that is Kenya's free education

In most secondary schools, remedial classes are mandatory.

National Parents Association chairman Silas Obuhatsa blamed the State for the crisis, saying, it had forced schools into bankruptcy.

Capitation funds

“How are principals to run those institutions?” he posed.

Mr Obuhatsa said he had met with Kenya Secondary School Heads Association National Chairman Willy Kuria, who confirmed that capitation funds have not been released.

“According to Mr Kuria, the State only released 40 per cent of capitation funds last term ... by then schools were grappling with huge debts. As per his statement, every child was given Sh8,200 instead of Sh11,122,” said Mr Obuhatsa.

Read: State urges private schools to reduce tuition fees

He added that, to date, the capitation balance for the first term has not been released.

“Principals cannot run schools without money and the government knows this. Principals are in a dilemma. There is a circular that was released by the State barring them from sending students home due to fees or any other funds but then again how do you run a school without funds?” Mr Obuhatsa said.

Pay school fees

Parents, he added, should also pay school fees as the institutions have huge pending bill arising from non-payment of school fees.

“Lack of capitation is forcing principals to illegally send students home to fetch fees,” he added.

Mr Obuhatsa urged the government to support schools.

“Capitation funds should be released immediately to enable principals to manage school affairs. Otherwise, the State should address how principals can sustain children in schools without money, especially boarding schools,” he added.

Meanwhile, opposition politicians have called on President William Ruto’s administration to release capitation monies to schools.

National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wanday urged Dr Ruto to put in place effective mechanisms of funding education.

“You have failed as a government. As we speak, schools have not received all the capitation money; it is a miracle that the institutions are operating. We continue to insist that the State should put in place proper mechanisms and put aside adequate funds to support the education sector,” he said.

Separately, Jomvu MP Badi Twalib has warned principals against sending learners home for not paying tuition or remedial classes fees.

“Please don’t send students home because of issues to do with school fees,” said Mr Twalib.

On Tuesday, June 11, the Nation met scores of students who were sent home for fees. At Kajembe Secondary School, learners were dismissed to fetch Sh1,000 for remedial classes. The students said they pay Sh1,000 per term for remedial classes.

"Our big aim is Afcon 2027, Harambee Stars coach Firat says","In Lilongwe, Malawi

Kenya coach Engin Firat cut a dejected figure at the end of their 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier Group 'F' match against Cote d’Ivoire at the Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi on Tuesday.

A vastly improved Harambee Stars failed to capitalise on the chances they produced in their promising but ultimately disappointing 0-0 draw against the African Champions

“Today against the African champions I can actually say that we deserved to win. We had good chances and Cote d’Ivoire had the ball and only had one chance at goal,” Firat said.

“I know that plenty of people thought that we were going to lose with a big margin but even though the boys play in low leagues, if they’re united as a team and we follow our tactical approach we’ll have a chance to win even against the African champions,” he added.

Firat said he is now seeing a silver lining.

“We have a team with a lot of potential and the big aim is Afcon 2027,” he explained.

Read: Olunga - Cote d’Ivoire not on our minds for now

The result did little favour to Kenya’s World Cup qualification ambitions after they dropped points for the second consecutive time.

On Friday, Kenya were held to a 1-1 draw by minnows Burundi.

After four matches, the Elephants top the group with 10 points while Gabon, who have played three matches, are second with six points.

Harambee Stars, who have played four fixtures, are third with five points while Burundi, Gambia and Seychelles, who have all played three matches, follow in that order with four, three and zero points.

After a rather subdued outing against Burundi, Kenya were an entirely different outfit against Cote d’Ivoire.

In the pre-match press conference on Monday, Kenya captain Michael Olunga spoke of them having no fear and it showed in the first 10 minutes of play as Harambee Stars confidently passed the ball around and hogged possession.

But it was the African champions who threatened first on 24 minutes when midfield maestro Franck Kessie fired over the bar in the first shot on goal.

At the other end, Olunga got a chance at the edge of the box but shot wide when hitting the target looked easier.

Kenya’s best chance of the match fell to Olunga in the 71st minute. He broke away and fed Timothy Ouma who failed to beat the keeper in a one-on-one situation.

The ball fell kindly on Olunga’s feet but his effort was cleared off the line for a corner.

With no stadium presently available in Kenya to host the qualifiers, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has settled on the Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe as the venue of Harambee Stars' home matches.

At the end of the qualifiers, the nine group winners will qualify directly to the 2026 Fifa World Cup while the four best group runners-up will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs for the final slot.

Sh400m secret transfer in Directline war with IRA,"On a chilly afternoon on May 15, media mogul Samuel Kamau Macharia wrote to Diamond Trust Bank (DTB) to wire Sh400 million from Directline Assurance Company Ltd to a housing firm he owns, unaware that it would awaken a five-year-old fight with the insurance regulator.

The millions were wired to an account belonging to Toy and Suna Holdings, a company fully owned by Mr Macharia, to finance the development of stalls and low-cost housing at Toy Market, in Nairobi.

A whistleblower alert led the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) to successfully freeze the Sh400 million, triggering a chain reach that saw an angry Mr Macharia shut down Directline and fire all employees before the regulator revoked the action.

The back-and-forth battle between the regulator and the media tycoon has stirred the five-year ownership battle Directline Assurance, with both parties keeping conflicting shareholder records.

The legal battle for control of Directline Assurance pitting media mogul Samuel Kamau Macharia and IRA has revealed that the insurer’s true ownership is uncertain, with both parties keeping conflicting shareholder records.

The regulator has previously described Mr Macharia as a minority shareholder with a 10 percent stake through Royal Media Services, which does not entitle him to stage a corporate coup.

Mr Macharia has disputed IRA’s list of Directline’s shareholders, saying he and his associates are majority shareholders and therefore have a right to call the shots in the operations of the troubled insurer.

This position egged on the businessman on Monday evening to order closure of Directline, prompting a furious reaction from the regulator.

IRA Chief Executive Godfrey Kiptum on Tuesday rubbished the move, saying the insurer will continue to operate. “The purported actions are null and devoid of any legal effect and as such the insurer continues in full operation as licensed and approved by the Authority. The purported transfer of the assets of the insurer to any third party is therefore null and void ab initio (from the start),” Mr Kiptum said in a press statement to explain the status of the firm.



“All policies issued by Directline Assurance Company Limited remain in full force and effect and the insurer remains liable for any claims arising therefrom. All policyholders of the insurer may continue with their operations in accordance with their insurance contracts,” the IRA CEO added.

The regulator maintains that it has the sole authority to “approve, suspend or cancel” the operations of any insurance company in Kenya, terming Mr Macharia’s action as usurping of IRA duties.

Unknown to many in the market, Mr Macharia and IRA have been quietly fighting since June 3 when a whistleblower informed the regulator that Sh400 million had been transferred from Directline Assurance Company to Toy and Suna Holdings.

This forced the IRA to seek court help on June 4. In documents filed in court, the regulator stated that Directline was in breach of its permit, which bars the firm from engaging in business outside insurance.

It was also argued that Mr Macharia had upset the law by transferring assets of the insurance firm to a third party--Toy and Suna Holdings.

Directline Assurance was established in 1998 by John Macharia, son of the Royal Media Group owner who died in a road accident in April 2018.

After moving to court, the regulator obtained orders freezing the money, pending the determination of the petition. “Unless the orders sought herein are granted, the policyholders and their beneficiaries stand to suffer irreparable loss and harm which cannot be compensated by way of damages,” the regulator said in court documents, adding that the insurer has unpaid claims of Sh2 billion as of April.

Justice Alfred Mabeya granted the freeze order on June 6 and directed the case to be mentioned on June 18 for further action.

A few days later, Mr Macharia as the chairman of Royal Credit Limited - one of the shareholders of Directline, announced that the insurer had closed operations and laid off all its staff.

“The board of directors of Directline has been dissolved and all the assets taken over by Royal Credit Ltd. All employees have been dismissed, and Directline will no longer issue insurance services,” Mr Macharia said.

The communication caused panic, especially in public transport, as the firm has the largest share of the public service vehicles insurance business.

Directline insurance controls 69.6 percent of the public service vehicle industry, with premiums of over Sh3.4 billion, says IRA.

On Tuesday, Mr Macharia did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment.

IRA now says it has placed the insurer under “heightened surveillance” as the row reopens a public shareholder spat.

On Tuesday, AKM Investments Limited and Janus Limited, who are listed at the firm’s registry to own 10 percent and 20 percent stakes in Directline, criticised Mr Macharia’s closure notice. “The shareholders and Directline Assurance Company Limited hereby entirely disown the content of the said statement,” AKM and Janus said in a joint statement.

Janus Limited is associated with Directline’s former CEO, Terry Wijenje, who was forcibly removed from the firm by Mr Macharia in September 2010. AKM Investments Limited is linked to Lisa Anyango Amenya, the partner of Mr Macharia’s late son, John Gichia.

Ms Amenya’s son, Adam Kamau, in 2019 also moved to court seeking to stop Mr Macharia from administering his father’s Sh1.2 billion estate.

At stake, were shares in more than six companies that have investments in insurance, communications and real estate. They are Directline Insurance, Serenity Media Productions Ltd, Big Five Conservancy, Bushfire Media Distributors, Toi Redevelopment and Harbour Capital Ltd.

Other properties are nine vehicles – two Range Rover cars, Land Rover, Jaguar, Jeep, Porsche 911, BMW, Trailer and Land Rover Discovery -- four motorbikes and five residential houses in Nanyuki, Loresho (Nairobi), Kyuna crescent (Nairobi), Kibarage (Nairobi) and Mugumo crescent (Nairobi).

Ms Amenya is listed as a director of Directline, according to the CR12 form at the company registry.

But Mr Macharia does not recognize the directors listed in the form, and lists Julius Orenge (chairman), Salome Gitoko and Kelvin Mogeri as directors of the firm.



Mr Macharia has previously argued that the register’s version of the shareholder roll was a creation of the firm’s directors whom the billionaire reckons had no powers to create and allocate shares.

This implies that Mr Macharia and his family own a 20 percent stake, in AKM Investments (48 percent) and Janus Limited (32 percent), an ownership the tycoon argues made him majority owner and gave him the right to stage the corporate coup.

The CR12 form lists six shareholders including Mr Macharia and his family (10 percent), AKM Investments (10 percent), Janus (20 percent), Sureinvest (20 percent) Triad (20 percent) and Stenny Investments (20 percent).

The ownership based on Mr Macharia’s position could be in breach of regulations that limit individual ownership of firms to a maximum of 25 percent.

The battle for control of the Directline rests on the company’s ownership with the key issue in the battle having been referred to both the courts and the arbitration process.

On May 11, 2022, Mr Phillip Bliss Aliker, the arbitrator found that Mr Macharia had unlawfully interfered with the management of the company and must be restrained.

The arbitrator has backed the list of shareholders appearing in the CR12 form, but Mr Macharia went back to court to challenge the decision.

Mathira’s economy takes a beating on closure of bars,"Residents' pain over the closure of alcohol outlets in Mathira perfectly depicts the law of unintended consequences, which posits that actions and decisions, especially by the government, can have adverse and unforeseen results.

With the local economy in tatters and hundreds of jobs lost, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua'scrusade against alcoholism and illicit brews now seems to be hitting locals in unexpected ways.

Small business people such as boda boda operators and vendors of street foods are reeling from the four-months-long closure of entertainment joints in the DP's backyard, which, incidentally, is the only sub-county that had effected a total moratorium on the alcohol business.

Also affected are people who operate eateries and those in the transport sector. About 400 bar owners have now petitioned the national government to allow them to reopen their businesses, saying, the closure had negatively impacted the local economy.

Club owners

“The closure of these establishments has not only affected bar and club owners, leading to the loss of hundreds of jobs, but has also caused a detrimental ripple effect across different sectors that depend on our operations, denying them a source of livelihood,” the traders said in the petition that was signed by Mathira Bar Owners Association Chairman Charles Wachira Ngatia.

Last month, Central Regional Commissioner Frederick Shisia had chaired a high-level meeting that agreed on the phased reopening of bars starting with high-end establishments. The resolution has, however, not been implemented. And, last week, some of the operators attempted to reopen their doors but the government came down hard on them.

The closure of the bars, which the government says is due to their proximity to learning institutions and churches, has created a scene reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic days. Loud music blasting from drinking joints, people enjoying nyama choma and mutura (barbecued cow tripe), and inebriated revelers staggering home have become rare scenes.

Illicit liquor

“Although we are supporting the government in its fight against illicit liquor, the blanket closure of bars has badly affected our business,” Mathira Boda Boda Association Chairman Benjamin Mwangi told the Nation. ""We used to ferry revellers home when the bars closed at 11pm but this is no longer the case.”

Ms Mercy Wacuka, who used to hawk sausages and boiled eggs from bar to bar, said she has lost her only source of a livelihood.

“This government promised to uplift the hustlers but they are now making us poorer by the day,” she said. Echoing her views were many other small-scale traders, who called on the government to allow licensed establishments to reopen.

“I hope they will come up with a solution and open the bars. You can see there are no customers,” said Mr Jackson Muriithi, who runs a streetside mutura stand.

Are we getting closer to a HIV vaccine?,"In the wake of the infected blood scandal, where more than 30,000 people were infected with HIV and hepatitis C from 1970 to 1991 by contaminated blood products and transfusions, the United Kingdom has published a public inquiry report.

It has drawn the world’s attention once again to the HIV pandemic, which has claimed millions of lives globally - disproportionately in Africa.

For decades, the relentless pursuit by the global scientific community of a HIV vaccine has featured a cycle of breakthroughs, hope and setbacks. Yet, recent advancements that can target multiple strains of HIV by broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) offer renewed optimism.

How close are we really to achieving an effective vaccine?

Why is finding a vaccine important

Finding a HIV vaccine is crucial because it represents the most promising strategy for halting the spread of the virus and ultimately eradicating it. In Africa, where HIV/Aids has had a devastating impact, the significance of a vaccine cannot be overstated. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly 70 per cent of the global HIV-positive population, with millions of new infections each year. The socio-economic burden of the epidemic is immense, affecting families, communities and entire nations. An effective HIV vaccine would dramatically reduce new infections, improve public health and alleviate the long-term healthcare costs associated with managing the disease. Moreover, it would empower individuals and communities, fostering economic stability and enabling a brighter future for the continent. In essence, a HIV vaccine is not just a medical breakthrough; it is a lifeline for Africa's development and well-being.

The hope of broadly neutralising antibodies

Broadly neutralising antibodies are like elite soldiers in our immune system, capable of recognising and neutralising various strains of HIV. Recently, scientists have demonstrated that it is possible to induce these crucial antibodies through vaccination. This breakthrough provides significant hope that we might finally be on the right path toward developing an effective HIV vaccine.

Learning from past failures

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been a lifesaver, transforming HIV from a death sentence to a manageable condition. However, ART is not a cure, and a vaccine remains the ultimate goal to end the epidemic once and for all.

The journey has been anything but smooth. Several high-profile HIV vaccine trials over the years have failed, dampening hopes and fuelling skepticism that an effective vaccine will ever be developed for AIDS. Despite setbacks in the development of a vaccine, its importance cannot be overstated, especially for regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV remains a pervasive and devastating epidemic.

A new approach: Small-scale trials

A promising strategy has been to conduct multiple small-scale, proof-of-concept clinical trials, allowing researchers to test multiple vaccine approaches on a smaller scale. This enables a thorough assessment of safety and efficacy before investing time and money into larger, more expensive trials. This iterative process helps refine vaccine candidates and increases the chance of success of large-scale trials.

Several novel HIV vaccine concepts are currently undergoing small-scale clinical trials being held worldwide, including in Africa. For example, collaborations among the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, Scripps Research Institute and Moderna include the first-in-Africa clinical trial of an mRNA HIV vaccine. These trials allow for iterative improvements, increasing the likelihood that when and if it moves to a large-scale trial, it will result in a successful vaccine.

The road ahead

Progress made so far is encouraging. The scientific community is cautiously optimistic that with continued research, innovation and collaboration, a HIV vaccine is within reach. The small-scale trials currently underway are paving the way for future large-scale trials that could finally bring an effective HIV vaccine to fruition.

The devastation of Aids started to come to public consciousness more than 40 years ago. In the intervening time, there has been a relentless drive to develop a HIV vaccine to prevent the disease. Although the road has and continues to be long and challenging, recent advancements in inducing broadly neutralising antibodies and the strategic implementation of small-scale clinical trials provide hope.

Kenya face Burundi in Billie Jean Cup,"A potentially explosive clash between Angella Okutoyi and Sada Nahimana could be on the cards today as Kenya and Burundi compete for a place in the final of the Billie Jean King Cup Africa Group III in Nairobi.

Both Kenya (seed no.4) and Burundi (8) are tied on number of matches won after they bagged their second straight wins in Pool “B” on the clay courts of the Nairobi Club by defeating Tunisia and Mauritius, respectively yesterday. It means whoever wins between Kenya and Burundi will play in the three-team final pitting winners of pools “A”, “B” and “C”.

Coach Francis Rogoi’s Kenya came from behind to stun second seeds Tunisia 2-1 yesterday.

Cynthia Wanjala lost her singles match against Ranim Rassil 6-2, 6-4 before Okutoyi levelled the scores 1-1 after earning a hard-fought win in the second singles match by beating Chiraz Bechri 6-3, 7-6(9).

Wanjala, who was let down by service in singles, turned up strongly in doubles, partnering Okutoyi as they overpowered Bechri/Rassil 6-2, 6-3. Initially, Kenya had planned to use Okutoyi’s twin sister Roselida Asumwa and Alicia Owegi, in doubles, but after tying 1-1 in singles, Okutoyi and Wanjala, who partnered well during the last edition of Billie Jean King Cup Africa Group III when Kenya bagged bronze at the Nairobi Club, won a silver medal at the African Games in Accra, Ghana in March this year.

“It feels so good to win doubles and also the match against Tunisia, even though I had lost my singles match. I worked on my serves after the singles match and you could see I improved a lot in this department,” said Wanjala, admitting that she feels more confident partnering Okutoyi in doubles. The two were in Tunisia for three weeks of training and playing tournaments just before coming to Nairobi for the Billie Jean King Cup.

Nice and motivating

Okutoyi heaped praise on Wanjala, who cleared school at Mbagathi Road High School last year.

“Playing with Cynthia is always nice and motivating. We had a good result at the African Games. Her serves and strokes and placement of the ball helped us win doubles today,” noted Okutoyi, the 2022 Wimbledon Junior Doubles champion.

Nahimana and Okutoyi are ranked 364th and 491st in women’s pro tennis (WTA) and second and third in Africa, respectively, after Tunisian Ons Jabeur (world no.10).

Captains are expected to make their nominations early today on who will play in singles and doubles, and there is a likelihood Okutoyi and France-based Nahimana, who lived in Kenya for nine years as a child, will meet in singles.

Third tier

Okutoyi,20, and Nahimana,23, made history by winning the W25 level tournament when they partnered during the W25 Nairobi 2 at the Nairobi Club in December last year. It was the first time a Kenyan had won the W25, which is in the third tier of women’s pro tennis (ITF Women's World Tennis Tour).

The two met during the W15 Nairobi tournament in August 2019 when Okutoyi went down fighting 2-6, 6-2, 7-6.

“We hope for a good match against Burundi,” Okutoyi said yesterday.

Nahimana said: “I know Okutoyi well. She’s been really consistent with results and maturing into pro tennis. She is playing amazing tennis and I’m hoping for a good match against her.”

Kenya and Burundi thrashed Mauritius and Tunisia 3-0 and 2-1 on the first day, respectively. Burundi defeated Mauritius 3-0 on Tuesday.

In other matches held on Tuesday, June 11, South Africa and Nigeria strung their second win without dropping a match in Pool “A” and “B” after thrashing Madagascar and Ghana, respectively.

South Africa, who got relegated to Europe/Africa Group II last year, defeated Namibia 3-0 as Nigeria whipped Uganda by a similar score on the first day on Monday. Zimbabwe and Botswana are also unbeaten in pools “A” and “C”, respectively.

"Leah's journey from Dubai, Joyce's rise from Mukuru: Two domestic workers and their remarkable tales","As she steps into the one-eighth of an acre plot in Bahati, Nakuru, Leah Nyokabi Mburu cracks jokes with masons working overtime to meet construction deadlines.

Wearing heavy boots, she hands one of the skilled masons a brick hammer and a brickwork gauge rod that has accidentally fallen.

Leah could easily pass for one of the women selling food to construction workers building a one-bedroom house. But a close observation from the sidelines reveals she could as well be a site manager having an overview of the entire project.

She picks a dirty and worn-out construction plan and consults with the supervisor. After a conversation for about 15 minutes, she heads to a magnificent two-bedroom house already occupied.

“I’m not a construction worker. I’m here to check the progress of this project, which I’m putting up. I started by constructing my two-bedroom house and later put up two bedsitters in the same compound. This one-bedroom house is my latest project,” says Leah, a domestic worker in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Read: Abuse and dignity: A tale of two worlds for domestic workers

At 36, she has overcome numerous hurdles to become a young landlady, an achievement many of her peers are still striving for amid numerous challenges.

""Turning 36 and the life experience that comes with middle adulthood has taught me big life lessons,"" Leah says as she ushers us into her beautiful two-bedroom house.

""I have decided to put my young adulthood life experience to good use by becoming a landlady who works as a domestic worker. I want to prove that women working as domestic workers, both at home and abroad, can not only excel in the property sector but also outsmart men with their persistence and dedication to hard work.""

""Having a roof over your head is the best feeling ever,"" she adds. ""It feels warm and comforting because home is full of memories and continuing love.""

Leah's journey began when she worked as a cleaner at the National Assembly in Nairobi, earning Sh6,500 per month. Her subsequent savings from domestic work helped her build her first house.

""To most people, house rent is often the top monthly expense. Falling behind on rent payments can lead to severe consequences ranging from public embarrassment to eviction. The monthly pressure to pay rent is directly related to the ability to pay for other basic needs, such as food and medical care, especially if you are a woman. That is why I work hard to change my status from a tenant to a landowner.""

But what motivated the mother of two – a boy and a girl – to become a landlady?

""I first went to Saudi Arabia in 2012 at the age of 24,"" states Leah, who is currently at home on annual leave.

""I earned Sh16,000 per month, but I never knew anything about saving. I used to wire cash home to my close relatives since I was the sole breadwinner. After mastering the survival tricks, I shifted to another employer, where I was paid Sh36,000 per month.""

Leah's ambitious careerism as a domestic worker in Saudi Arabia melted the heart of Ibrahim Maina, whom she met there and later married.

""Meeting Ibrahim in 'the land of the Two Holy Mosques' was a blessing to me as we pooled resources and bought two plots of one-eighth of an acre at Sh400,000 each,"" she says.

Read: The silent suffering of domestic workers

""I was able to save money with my husband, whom I met in Saudi Arabia, and I'm happy he's my pillar because he's 100 per cent supporting my saving culture, which has seen us construct our first house at a cost of Sh800,000.""

While working in Dubai, Leah came across a video where an official of a domestic workers' association was speaking about the importance of saving and borrowing for Kenyan domestic workers abroad.

""I loved her idea of a domestic workers' Savings and Credit Cooperative (Sacco). I joined immediately and started saving. I didn't want to repeat the mistake I made of not saving for a rainy day when I first went to Saudi Arabia.""

Leah, who once worked in a quarry earning Sh150 per day, says the current one-bedroom house project under construction is a result of the loans she has borrowed from the Sacco.

""So far, I have borrowed more than Sh400,000 to kick-start the projects that I have undertaken, including the construction of two one-bedroom rental houses, which bring in Sh2,400 every month each,"" says Leah, who has also worked in Bahrain.

""I also buy shares at the Sacco every month. Over time, Saccos can grow and expand, leading to an increase in their share value. This means my initial investment in shares could appreciate, potentially giving me a profitable return.""

She has also bought another one-eighth of an acre piece of land in Mai Mahiu at Sh200,000 and another one in Nyahururu at Sh180,000. Their values have sharply appreciated.

Read: Reflecting on the injustice meted on domestic workers

""If I were to sell the two pieces of land in Mai Mahiu and Nyahururu, I would fetch Sh1 million as each is now going for Sh500,000, according to the latest market value.""

However, Leah acknowledges that building a house while working abroad is not a walk in the park.

""The construction work may not go according to plan because of the lack of strict site supervision. The price of materials is inflated, and this makes the project costly,"" she explains.

""My plan is buying and owning real estate as an investment strategy because it can be both satisfying and lucrative.""

About 200 kilometres from Bahati, Nakuru, the story of Joyce Mwikali is no different.  When we catch up with her in Mukuru Nyayo slums, Nairobi, Joyce opens up about her life as a domestic worker for decades.

Joyce says she was devastated to learn that she was pregnant in 2002 at only 15 years old. A few months after giving birth, she realised she needed a job as her mother would not take care of her and her baby.

This is how she plunged into domestic work to make ends meet, a career she holds to date.

""The job was the easiest to get. I did not require any academic certificates and experience,"" Mwikali reveals.

Her starting salary as a domestic worker was Sh1,500 in a home in Nairobi West. The money, however, was not enough for her needs and those of her baby.

Read: Training graceful maids and nannies in the digital age

She still works as a house help three times a week in one of the homes on an estate near the slums.

While still working as a house help, Joyce, who always admired being a salonist, used her free time to train as a hairdresser.

""Every day after doing my work, I would go to a local salon for two hours, where I learned braiding, hairdressing, and general salon work. I slowly became an expert.""

Joyce says her goal thereafter was to start her own salon, something that was held back for a while by lack of capital. However, despite the financial challenges, she managed to start a small salon at Mukuru Nyayo slums.

""I was so happy after I opened my own salon. I told myself that indeed my journey to financial freedom had started in earnest,"" she recounts.

However, her joy was short-lived after her salon was razed by fire in September 2023. The mother of two says she became hopeless and devastated, unsure of what to do next.

Being a member of the domestic workers’ Sacco came in handy for her.

""I am a member of the Sacco and have saved about Sh30,000. I took a loan of Sh45,000 and, together with support from my friends and well-wishers, I opened another salon in December 2023,"" she says.

In a day, Joyce says she makes at least Sh2,000 from the salon. The earnings, she admits, have helped her upgrade her lifestyle and stay debt-free.

Joyce, who works with her daughter in the salon, reveals that plans to open a second branch in the nearby Shimo la Tewa slums are in top gear.

""I have already finished repaying the loan I took last year, and now I want to take a bigger loan to open the new salon. My goal is to fully become self-reliant.""

Her message to fellow domestic workers is not to despise themselves but rather use their work as a stepping stone to success.

Leah and Joyce are living testaments that with determination and hard work, domestic work can indeed be a path to financial independence. Their story mirrors that of many others in the domestic work sphere who are toiling hard to change their lives.

A recent survey on domestic workers conducted by IDAY reported that Kenya has around two million domestic workers. The survey indicated that among them, 11 to 24 per cent are under 18 years old and a considerable percentage of adult domestic workers are young, with about 80 per cent aged 18 to 30.

Since 2019, Kenya has been training 7,000 domestic workers every month for the labour export market, especially for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries of Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia, where Kenya has bilateral Labour Agreements for unskilled labour.

According to the International Labour Organisation, there are about 75.6 million domestic workers globally.

The evolving role of central banks in Africa,"Broadly, the core mandates of central banks around the world are twofold: maintaining price stability and oversight of the financial system. There are nuances of course. Famously, the US Fed, for example, also has the responsibility to promote employment, in addition to price stability.

In the context of our countries, by and large, the formal and core mandate of central banks are similar.

But operating as they do in a hugely complex and dynamic environment, central banks in our countries also have at least two more factors—even if informally—that they consider as core mandates.

Fostering financial sector development—going well beyond the typical role of central banks, as elsewhere, needing to supervise and regulating banks and financial markets. In most African countries, financial deepening remains a major challenge.

For one, access to banking services remains far from universal, even with the advent of fintech. And beyond basic banking services financial intermediation still has ways to go.

Central banks in the region are also implicated in governments’ quest for financing, both internally and externally. The extent of this varies from country to country, of course. But with domestic financial markets rather shallow in most of the region, some governments borrow directly from central banks. And even where that is not the case, in the region rare is the central bank that does not keep a keen eye on the cost of financing its fiscal authority is facing.

To be clear, I am not arguing that these two considerations are the responsibility, much less part of central banks’ mandates in the region. Rather, inevitably and unavoidably, they feature prominently as central banks pursue their core functions in most developing countries.

How then have central banks fared in the pursuit of these responsibilities over the years?

Increasing price stability

The journey of central banking in sub-Sahara has been one marked by resilience and transformation. Emerging from the shadows of colonial legacy, central banks in sub-Sahara started their journey in the early post-colonial era rigid fixed exchange rate and rule-based regimes, including currency boards.

Through the course of the 1970s and early 1980s though, countries found themselves facing severe oil price shocks, floating exchange rates internationally, tight financing conditions and considerable political turmoil. Central banks were struggling to achieve multiple objectives. This included the onerous task of financing government deficits, precipitating rampant inflation and economic instability.

The 1990s heralded a new era of reforms geared towards more discretionary arrangements. Many countries initiated bold reforms to shift towards more flexible exchange rate systems and to reduce dependence on central bank financing of fiscal deficits. This pivotal shift wasn’t just about new monetary policies to curb deficit financing; it was about reshaping the economic landscape and laying the groundwork for stability and growth.

During this period and into the 2000s, financial sector reforms took centre stage, with many countries modernising and liberalising their banking systems. Market-based interest rates were introduced, and independent regulatory agencies established. Moreover, regional integration initiatives, such as Ecowas, EAC, and SADC, spurred efforts to harmonise financial regulations and promoted cross-border banking supervision.

Engendering financial sector development

Despite the region historically lagging in credit-to-GDP ratios, reforms since the 2000s have spurred gradual increases, supported by regulatory enhancements and competition promotion. These efforts yielded notable benefits, including enhanced banking sector performance and stability, deeper financial intermediation, and improved financial literacy.

However, there is still ample room for growth, particularly in the realm of financial markets where progress has been less pronounced.

Read: Central Bank in the spotlight as lenders run out of dollars

To further gauge progress in financial deepening, it is also useful to examine regional money multiplier trends. Higher multipliers in more developed financial systems signify banks' increased ability to lend efficiently, thus expanding the money supply.

Evidence across sub-Sahara suggests varying effectiveness in supporting economic development, influenced by factors like banking competition, financial innovation, monetary policy frameworks, fiscal-monetary policy interactions, and exposure to global conditions.

Despite recent strides, there remains substantial room for enhanced financial intermediation in the region, as median money multipliers lag those of emerging and advanced economies.

What is quite remarkable, on the other hand, is that the region is leading the world in innovative financial services based on mobile telephony. Mobile-based systems such as digital payments, digital savings, micro-insurance, peer-to-peer lending have boosted financial inclusion, especially in East Africa.

Yet, there is a significant untapped potential in other countries, offering solutions to infrastructure and other shortcomings.

Microfinance has also grown in some countries in SSA, aiding lower-income individuals.

Conditional on solid regulatory frameworks, such innovations could cut costs, lessen cash dependence, and boost financial development in SSA economies.

Financing the government

I would be remiss without touching on the issue of central bank lending to the government for fiscal purposes, something that many (but by no means all) central banks in the region have had to be involved in. Its appropriateness has been an issue of much debate over the years.

And recent economic developments have brought the matter once again to the fore. I am here talking about the funding squeeze many countries have been experiencing, as external financing conditions have tightened, domestic ones have followed, official development assistance declined, and tax revenue collection has been weak.

Excessive fiscal dominance has exacted a heavy toll in the region over the years, notably causing episodes of high inflation, heightened economic uncertainty, and undermining investment and growth. Examples include DRC (1991-92, 1993-94, and 1998), Angola (1994-97), and Zimbabwe (2007-08, 2019-20).

And short of three-digit and/or hyperinflation levels, there are many other episodes of inflation accelerating to the 30-50 percent range in countries around the region—recent cases include Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria.

By no means am I arguing that central government borrowing is the only reason for the spike in inflation. Rather, it is a predominant factor, with other, often exogenous shocks—for example, food price increases—and accommodative monetary conditions also contributing.

Over the years, legal constraints on central bank financing of fiscal debt have been implemented worldwide, including in our region, to address the risks of fiscal dominance. Despite this, central bank lending to governments remains a pressure point in sub-Saharan Africa.

Recourse to central bank financing had started to drift to levels seen outside the region between 2000 and the global financial crisis—from four to two percent of GDP.

But since then, borrowing from central banks has been trending upwards, and jumped a notch with the onset of the Covid pandemic bringing the median level of borrowing back to the four percent mark for the region as of 2023. This is about double the level of other developing regions.

Challenges going forward

Overall, central banks in the region have been instrumental in the progress countries have made over the years. All the more so given the hugely challenging circumstances that central banks operate in, weak policy transmission mechanism, the still shallow financial markets and underdeveloped regulatory frameworks.

What makes our region so fascinating and working on issues affecting our countries so fascinating and demanding are the hours one could spend considering the difference in outcomes, say for inflation and growth, between and within countries with fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

Read: Central Bank buys dollars to curb shilling volatility

Take just countries in the eastern part of the continent: was inflation higher in Ethiopia because of or despite the higher levels of growth observed over the years? How has Uganda been able to keep inflation consistently low?

In a more forward-looking vein, I have to say the context for macroeconomic policy formulation is a hugely challenging one. The progress that has been made is now being severely tested. The region faces hurdles from a decidedly difficult external environment—something that could get more difficult still if ongoing geopolitical tensions continue to further disrupt trade and investment flows.

More domestic policy challenges facing central bankers include the huge development financing needs countries face, persistent current account deficits and exchange rate pressures. All these constrain the scope for monetary policy manoeuvre. Decreasing international reserve buffers have also heightened vulnerability to external shocks.

In this difficult environment, safeguarding stability to foster the growth that countries need and the immiserating consequences of high inflation on the poor will be a challenging undertaking.

In this dynamic landscape, policymakers must adopt careful strategies, leveraging insights to calibrate monetary policy responses effectively, safeguarding against risks and nurturing resilience in the face of uncertainty. With this in mind, I would like to emphasise four key policy areas, which in my opinion have become increasingly important for central bankers today: exchange rate flexibility, contending with high public debt, financial sector risk management, and the growing importance of financial innovations.

Exchange rate flexibility

In sub-Sahara, the prevalence of fixed exchange rate regimes reflects a widespread ""fear of floating,"" driven by concerns about exchange rate volatility's impact on inflation, balance sheets, and socio-political stability. This highlights the intricate balancing act policymakers face, especially amid current global volatility. However, relying on fixed exchange rates limits policy flexibility and risks sudden adjustments, necessitating a more adaptable monetary strategy.

Globally, more central banks are turning to inflation targeting, prioritising price stability while retaining the capacity to respond to economic shocks. Increasing monetary policy credibility is the antidote to the fear of floating.

Monetary policy credibility, which takes time to acquire, is like a three-legged stool: saying clearly what you do, consistently doing what you say, and having the policy independency to do. Once policy credibility is achieved, the degree of exchange rate pass-through declines.

Contending with high public debt

Even when central banks stay clear of direct financing of the government, the pressure to ensure that there is adequate liquidity in the system and for the government’s borrowing costs to remain contained has been an age-old challenge in our countries and elsewhere. And in our region now with public debt levels quite elevated and domestic debt quite high, this challenge is set to be more acute still. Specifically, domestic debt now accounts for around half of public debt.

The pressure for monetary policy to accommodate fiscal financing pressures has in the past been and going forward will be a clear threat to the central bank’s ability to control inflation. The primary responsibility in dealing with this challenge of course remain firmly the responsibility of fiscal authorities.

Financial risk management

Prudent financial sector risk management is paramount, especially in countries where pan-African banks play a pivotal role. The emergence of such banks has been a welcome feature of the economic landscape in recent years and will help foster economic integration, competition, and financial inclusion.

But it comes with some risks that need to be managed carefully, notably weaker oversight from home country supervision or openings to exploit regulatory asymmetry.

To tackle this, we must carefully manage rapid credit growth, uphold prudent underwriting standards, monitor concentrated exposures, utilize macroprudential tools effectively, bolster bank resolution frameworks, enhance regional supervisory coordination, and strengthen anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism frameworks.

Financial innovations

With the proliferation of mobile money providers in Sub-Saharan Africa, central banks must upgrade their digital capabilities to ensure payments efficiency and manage risks, including those from crypto assets, cybersecurity, and illicit financial flows.

Kipchumba Murkomen reveals plan to increase fuel levy by 39 percent,"Motorists will pay more for petrol if Parliament approves a proposal by the Transport Ministry to increase the Fuel Levy Charge from Sh18 to Sh25 per litre to raise cash for road maintenance.

Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has urged the Finance and National Planning Committee of the National Assembly to approve the 39 percent rise, saying the current rates were last reviewed in July 2016 and don’t cover inflation on road construction and maintenance cost over the period.

Mr Murkomen seeks to increase the fuel levy through the Finance Bill, 2024. He appeared before the committee to provide final submissions on the Bill.

The tax, commonly referred to as road maintenance levy fund (RMLF), is collected at the fuel pump and is set at Sh18 per litre of petrol and diesel with Sh3 allocated to annuity fund and the balance to road maintenance, rehabilitation, and development.

“It is concluded that increasing the fuel levy charge from Sh18 per litre to Sh25 per litre yields a revenue outcome, which is consistent with halting the increase in the maintenance backlog,” Mr Murkomen told the MPs.

“When the current fuel levy rate of Sh18 per litre was established in 2016, the pump price of petrol in Nairobi was Sh95. As of May 2024, the pump price is Sh194 while fuel levy remains at Sh18 per litre. This difference illustrates the loss of purchasing power of the fuel levy over time due to inflation” he explained.

Read: Government now takes up to Sh79 in tax for every litre of fuel

He said that, if approved, the review would generate up to Sh115 billion annually for roads upgrade.

The government currently collects Sh83 billion from the levy, but targets to collect an additional Sh32 billion if it rises to Sh25 a litre.

Mr Murkomen said the financing gap for road maintenance over the five years (2023 to 2027) is Sh315 billion against the projected RMLF collections.

This, he said, will likely increase the maintenance backlog over that period that stood at Sh727 billion as of 2022.

The State maintains the country’s road network through the Kenya Roads Board Fund (KRBF), which is mainly financed through the proceeds of the RMLF as well as transit tolls.

“As mentioned earlier in this brief, the quantum of fuel levy per litre was last amended in 2016. It is proposed that consideration now be given to reviewing the current quantum of the fuel levy,” he said.

He told MPs that there are emerging challenges in road maintenance including a gap between maintenance needs and the available resources, which affects the road network of all the three sector agencies.

Read: Moving from fuel levy to green road user charges

There is an absence of a mechanism to guarantee the portion of the funds allocated annually to rural roads under the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) is used to maintain paved rural roads, the CS said.

“The effect of the above gap between needs and resources is that excessively delayed maintenance is now adversely impacting roads conditions, a pattern that is projected to accelerate unless resolved,” Mr Murkomen said.

“In 2016 when the fuel levy charge was last adjusted, the length of paved roads nationally was 16,600 kilometres. By 2024, the length of paved roads has increased to 25,411 kilometres.”

He said the cost of maintaining paved roads is significantly higher than that of the unpaved.

Mr Murkomen said the road maintenance gap is anticipated to increase further in the near term due to the maintenance backlog that continues to grow.

Baringo North MP Joseph Makilap demanded to know the net effect of increasing the fuel levy by Sh7 per litre on the cost of goods.

Kigumo MP Joseph Munyoro asked the ministry to consider a percentage of fuel levy instead of increasing the amount by Sh7 per litre.

“We have a motor vehicle tax of 2.5 percent. We have an eco-levy on batteries. You now want to increase the fuel levy by Sh7. How are all these levies going to affect the cost of transportation?” David Mboni, the MP for Kitui Rurals, asked.

One million Kenyans living with disabilities in need of assistive devices,"One million Kenyans living with disabilities are in dire need of assistive technology (AT), Richard Bosire, the deputy director, Social Development, at the Ministry of Labour says.

AT refers to assistive products such as wheelchairs, eye glasses, hearing aids, artificial limbs and digital devices and their related systems and services that enable people to move, communicate and see better.

These products enable people to live healthier and more independent lives, working, studying and enjoying everyday moments that many may take for granted.

While urging the country to invest more in AT during the world’s first-ever Assistive Technology Day on June 4, the deputy director highlighted that innovative solutions and successful implementation will make a significant impact on the lives of individuals with disabilities and those in need of AT.

“As you are aware, there are currently around one million individuals in Kenya who require rehabilitative and assistive technology services, but are unable to access them due to various challenges,” he observed.

Mr Bosire explained that the objective of World AT Day is to bring together all relevant sectors such as health, education, social services, development and the private sector.

He noted that the day serves as a platform for users of AT to voice their experiences —  both the barriers they face and the benefits they derive from access.

“By listening to these stories, we can better appreciate the importance of assistive technology and advocate for policies and practices that enhance accessibility,” he said.

“We urge all stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental organisations, healthcare providers, educators and the private sector to allocate more resources towards the development and distribution of assistive technology, conduct training  for healthcare providers and awareness campaigns for the public about the importance and availability of assistive technology, develop supportive policies and foster innovation,” Mr Bosire sad

The commemoration comes after last year, the Ministry of Health launched the rehabilitative services and assistive technology strategy 2022-2026, disability medical assessment and categorisation guidelines 2022, and the ATscale Project.

According to the ministry, AT is most needed by older people, children and adults with disabilities as well as people with long term health conditions such as diabetes, stroke and dementia.

The Health ministry points out that the number of Kenyans living with disabilities is increasing.

“It is estimated that 0.9 million or 2.2 per cent of the population have a disability, which requires extensive healthcare services.”

The ATscale project is a three-year project geared towards supporting capacity building, strengthening supply chain for assistive technology, sustainable financing and development of policy and guidelines.

It aims at strengthening local capacity to produce, enhancing infrastructure, data and systems, enhancing demand generation and programme coordination. It is being executed in collaborated with Clinton Health Access Initiative .

Last year, Dr Zeinab Gura, acting director, Health Care Services at the Health ministry, explained that there are significant gaps facing the provision of rehabilitative services, which the ministry aims to prioritise through reviewing the harmonised benefit package to include the rehabilitation package, developing the list of essential assistive technology, and streamlining the training of human resources for rehabilitation services.

Dr Gura disclosed that the ministry’s strategy aims to increase access to care up to the primary health care and community levels by developing infrastructure, building human resource capacity, and providing equipment needed for rehabilitation services.

The strategy also envisions strengthening the Community Based Rehabilitation for early identification of disabilities and rehabilitation at the community level.

The guidelines, the director said, will ensure the appropriate and timely identification and categorisation of disabilities.

“The ministry is committed to providing oversight and guidance to the ATscale project to ensure its success,” the director assured.

The World Health Organization (WHO) observes that globally, more than 2.5 billion people need one or more assistive products.

With an ageing global population and a rise in non-communicable diseases, an estimated 3.5 billion people will need assistive technology by 2050.

“Improving access to assistive technology can contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring that no one is left behind.This is through enabling the inclusion and participation of assistive technology users in their family, community and all areas of society, including the political, economic and social spheres,” WHO notes adding that in many countries, most people who need assistive technology do not have access to it.

The WHO and UNICEF global report on assistive technology demonstrates considerable inequity in access to assistive technology.

“As few as three per cent of people in some low-income countries were reported to have access to the assistive products they need, in comparison to 90 per cent in some high-income countries.”

The report discloses that of the 80 million people who need a wheelchair, only five to 35 per cent will have access to one depending on the country in which they live.

On hearing, globally, 1.5 billion people have hearing loss, yet hearing aid production currently meets less than 10 per cent of the global demand.

This, according to the findings, means that unaddressed hearing loss across the globe leads to an annual cost of $980 billion.

“The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development places good health and well-being at the centre of a new development vision. It emphasises universal health coverage to ensure sustainable development for all so that everyone can access the health services needed without financial hardship,”the global health authority states.

Importers sue taxman over pricing of used cars,"The Car Importers Association of Kenya (Ciak) has sued the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) on claims that the taxman has failed to involve stakeholders in discussions on the Current Retail Selling Price (CRSP) of used imported vehicles.

The CRSP is the price template used by the KRA to compare the actual invoice value of the car and uses the higher of the two. The customs value is then calculated by applying the depreciation to the CRSP value. The excise duty, import duty, value-added tax (VAT), and import declaration fee(IDF) are all calculated from the customs value.

In its petition at the High Court in Mombasa, Ciak, whose membership is drawn from importers of new and used motor vehicle dealers in the country wants a declaration that KRA violated the Constitution concerning computations of the CSRP values on used imported vehicles.

Through Gikandi and Company Advocates, Ciak argues that the law requires that the formulation of a new CRSP be subjected to public participation involving stakeholders in the motor vehicle dealership business and members of the public who are consumers. According to Ciak, on or about May 20, KRA held an unlawful forum to deliberate on and approve the new CRSP without inviting it, stakeholders, and members of the public through a public notice and without furnishing a draft of the intended new CRSP in good time to prepare.

“In a copy of the list of invitees, the petitioner further realized that there was no intention to invite a representative of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) to the forum despite it being a major stakeholder by virtue of the fact that it is charged with inspecting all imported goods including new and used motor vehicles,” part of the suit documents state.

Ciak is seeking a declaration that the forum by KRA was held unlawfully without notice to the stakeholders and without furnishing the stakeholders with a draft copy of the intended new CRSP thus it was unlawful and deliberations and decisions emanating from it are null and void.

The association also seeks a declaration that KRA may only alter the CRSP published on its (KRA) website or the public portal in September 2017 only after the taxman fully complies with the law, particularly about giving the public and the stakeholders in the importation of used motor vehicles, the right to participate in the decision-making process.

The petitioner argues that from the deliberations of the forum, a decision was reached that KRA officers would start going around the country to collect views of members of the public on the intended new CRSP for publication.

“If KRA is not restrained from collecting the views of the members of the public and publishing the said intended new CRSP, it may at any time publish them (new intended CRSP) rendering the petition nugatory and occasioning the member of the petitioner irreparable damages,” argues Ciak.

It also argues that by failing to give the petition adequate notice to prepare and attend the meeting, its rights and those of other citizens as enshrined in the constitution were violated thus the process was flawed and should therefore not be allowed to proceed to completion.

The petitioner says that in the event KRA proceeds with the declarations of the applicable CRSP values for imported second-hand motor vehicles without its participation, the taxman is likely to arrive at values that are unreasonably too high.

It argues that such an outcome will result in the total selling price of each imported vehicle unit becoming higher on a proportionate basis of the increased taxation element and that higher sale values will result in a decline in sales.

“A decline in sales will result in reduced income for the petitioner which may lead to loss of employment for people who work for the petitioner either directly or indirectly,” says Ciak.

In his supporting affidavit, Ciak national chairman Me Peter Otieno stated that it was the duty of KRA to invite all stakeholders in the new and used motor vehicle dealership business and interested members of the public to the intended public participation forum through a notice and not to delegate the duty to the association.

“The petitioner did not comply with the KRA’s request to invite any of the individuals and entities listed,” stated Mr Otieno.

He added that without equal participation in deliberations for validation of a new CRSP, chances are high that they (new CRSP) will be oppressive and unreasonable as Ciak members cannot make any profit in their businesses unless they raise their retail prices.

The association also wants a conservative order issued to stop the KRA from taking any further step towards deliberating or arriving at a new CRSP based on the meeting it held on May 20 as the process is fundamentally flawed.

The case will be mentioned on June 12 for directions.

How commercial parastatals will change in planned law,"Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u has tabled far-reaching legal changes that seek to provide a new framework for establishing, controlling, and measuring performance of government-owned enterprises (GOEs).

The Government Owned Enterprises Bill 2024 seeks to overhaul governance structures and enhance accountability for commercial State-owned enterprises where it controls over 50 percent shareholding.

Entities targeted by the Bill are those engaged in business guided by commercial tenets and do not rely on Treasury’s annual budgets for funding. The Treasury says the changes are aimed at creating value for the public.

Establishment of Government Owned Enterprises (GoE)

The Bill provides for clear procedures for setting up commercial entities. The proposed law gives powers to the Cabinet to approve establishment of GoEs by the Companies Act. The line or relevant ministry will be required, through the Treasury, to prove the business case for setting up a new commercial entity, informed by a feasibility study report.

The study should ascertain financial and economic viability and give reasons why the business activity cannot be performed by existing entities. This will likely cure the current situation where the President and Cabinet Secretaries have powers to set up parastatals using procedures provided for in various laws such as the State Corporation Act and Public Finance Management Act.

Critics have argued that failure to adhere to procedures coupled with ambiguous definitions in the various laws has led to a proliferation of State-owned entities, some of which have overlapping and duplicative roles.

Read: Treasury seeks more revenue from financial sector regulators

Management of GoEs

The Bill provides that commercial parastatals shall be managed by a 10-member board of directors. It shall comprise a chairperson, who is an independent director, six independent directors, a nominee each by the Treasury and line ministry as well as a chief executive officer. The CEO shall be an ex officio member of the board.

President loses powers in appointment of chairpersons of GoEs

The chairperson shall be elected from among the independent directors. This is unlike the current arrangement where the President appoints chairpersons in commercial entities fully owned by the government. The President also currently has powers under the State Corporation Act to give general or specific directions to the board on the performance of their functions. This has in the past been criticised for partly interfering with the management of State-owned entities, resulting in suboptimal performance.

The Bill provides that the person to be elected chairperson must have proven business leadership or relevant professional experience with experience of at least five years in senior management or leadership, among other qualifications.

Selection panel to nominate independent directors to the board

The Bill provides that the Treasury Cabinet Secretary appoints a team to “conduct a structured, transparent and competitive process of search and selection of persons for nomination” to the board if the entity is fully owned by the government. The CS will then appoint the independent directors from the list of nominees.

The process appears close to that followed when appointing members to independent constitutional commissions. This is expected to bring in some level of independence in decision-making by the board which oversights the performance of the management. This is likely to mitigate cases of patronage and undue influences from the government in the appointment of board members of parastatals as was established by Presidential Taskforce Report 2013.

Qualifications for members of the selection panel include demonstrable leadership or senior managerial experience in the private or public sector for at least 10 years. The panel shall develop its procedures for thiring of directors to the board, and will be required to “maintain a proper record of all its meetings, including minutes”.

For commercial entities that are not fully owned by the State, the CS for Treasury will participate in the election of independent directors by shareholders proportionate to the government stake. This is more or less the same process followed under the current legal framework.

Egerton medical training cost dwarfs top varsities,"Egerton University has overtaken leading medical schools at the University of Nairobi (UoN), Kenyatta University (KU), and Moi University (MU) in the amount of tuition fees for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree students, becoming the most priced institution during this year’s intake.

An analysis by this publication of the fee structures for the highly competitive study discipline indicates that students seeking to pursue the course at the Njoro-based varsity must part with an annual charge of Sh643,940, while those joining Kisii University will pay the least amount at Sh461,210 during the first year.

The data, mined from the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) portal, shows that learners enrolling for the course in traditionally-renown institutions such as KU, MU and the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) will pay Sh612,000, which is Sh31,940 lower than the charge at Egerton.

Others charging a similar fee as the trio are Maseno University (MSU) and Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MUST) as well as Pwani University.

At the UoN, whose medical college is the oldest and arguably the most revered in the country, students will part with Sh635,000 for their opening year while those opting to pursue medicine in private universities that include the Kenya Methodist University (KEMU), Uzima University and Mount Kenya University (MKU), will pay Sh559,500, Sh535,700 and Sh510,000 respectively.



Though highly-priced, the course has for ages been considered a lucrative venture as professionals churned out are among the highest-paid in the country. Data shows that surgeons and medical doctors in local public facilities earn an average of Sh500,000 monthly while those in private practice take home higher perks.

Apart from doctors, other top earners in the country include judges, lawyers, pilots, architects, engineers, and accountants underscoring the aggressive drive by universities to offer courses in those fields due to high demand.

Before the newly unveiled funding model, the government through the Universities Fund (UF) would send block funding to the institutions based on the number of undergraduate students enrolled and the courses they selected.

Read: Sh14.4bn released for student loans, grants

Under the new model, funding will be student-centred and will be apportioned according to their levels of need and classified into four sets – vulnerable, extremely needy, needy, and less needy.

Funding to students will combine scholarships, loans, and household contributions on a graduated scale, which will be scientifically determined.

The shift compels tertiary institutions to peg their scramble for students to the quality of programmes and associated costs in a swing that will see only the fittest survive.

NSSF nets additional Sh10 billion on higher member contributions,"The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) collected an additional Sh10 billion in the year ended June 2023, underlining the impact of enhanced contributions from Kenyan workers.

Disclosures show that the State-owned pension firm raised Sh26.87 billion in the period, reflecting a 69 percent jump from a year earlier.

The sharp rise in the collection came at a time when contributions from salaried workers were increased to Sh600 from Sh200 for the lowest earner and between Sh320 to Sh1,080 for top earners.

Higher rates are meant to offer Kenyans a bigger retirement pot and give them monthly stipends as opposed to the current one-off payment.

“Member contributions grew by 69 percent to close the year at Sh26.87 billion compared to Sh15.92 billion in 2022 on account of enhanced contributions,” NSSF says in the disclosures made last Friday.

Read: Confusion over new NSSF deduction as first year ends

It did not disclose the number of members in the period under review. It had 348,291 members in June 2021.

Contributions from salaried workers were increased from February last year after a ruling by the Court of Appeal that reinstated the NSSF Act, 2013, quashing an earlier decision by the Employment and Labour Relations Court.

The NSSF Act 2013 increased monthly deductions and introduced two levels for workers taking home more than Sh18,000.

However, the Employment and Labour Relations Court in September 2022 rendered the NSSF Act of 2013 unconstitutional.

The decision by the Court of Appeal allowed NSSF to enforce the new contribution rates from workers and employers who had not been complying with the 2013 Act.



Under the new scale which is graduated, Tier 1 is for those in respect of pensionable earnings up to the lower earnings limit of Sh6,000. Tier 11 is those in respect of pensionable earnings above the lower earnings limit.

NSSF also received a major boost in the wake of improved performance of the firm’s shares and higher investment of surplus funds from members.

The value of NSSF’s shares at the Nairobi Stock Exchange jumped to Sh12.34 billion, reversing the hit of Sh3.15 billion booked a year earlier in the wake of a dip in the value of the stocks.

NSSF did not however disclose the interest that it will pay to member contributions in the wake of the improved performances in the year to June 2023.

When the numbers guy becomes a people person,"Moses Muthui, the Director for Consumer Banking at Absa Bank Kenya, is spearheading the bank’s customer-centric transformation, trading in his traditional suit and tie for sneakers and prioritising personal connections over numbers. This career banker is embracing a new approach, challenging industry norms like the sector’s high sense of self-importance.

It's been almost a year now since you switched roles from a numbers guy to a people person. How are you adapting to the strategic role?

After nearly 20 years in banking, with a decade abroad and various roles upon my return seven years ago, I’ve seen the industry evolve dramatically. My background in investment banking taught me to make decisions based on analytics and markets, but those experiences also revealed the often soulless nature of hardcore finance where numbers reign supreme. These experiences, however, have equipped me with unique advantages.

In my new role, I’ve experienced significant personal development. I’ve traded my peach-striped suits for sneakers and have visited 26 branches since the start of the year to meet customers. This shift has made everything more tangible. Now, I focus less on the technical aspects. I can’t remember the last time I used a calculator or analyzed a complex profit or loss account.

This role requires listening to people on a personal and emotional level. In my previous role, I commanded attention and immediate action; now, I build trust and develop as a leader, moving from being an expert to a business leader.

Do you feel this then makes your new role quite weighty?

I believe my role as the director of consumer banking is as significant as any other business role, though it comes with unique complexities. Every interaction matters. A branch must open on time, balance tills, and ensure everything runs smoothly from Monday to Friday, and half-day on Saturday. It’s a precise execution where every detail must align.

We are seeing a renewed push for that personal interaction between customers and banks with recent branch openings, How are you prepared to meet that demand?

I have a strong personal view on this: banking should meet people where they are, whether through physical branches or digital platforms. I like to refer to this as ‘clicks’ complementing ‘bricks.’ Clicks will never replace bricks; rather, they enhance the experience. Complex transactions, like mortgages or business loans, will always require human interaction.

Banks are evolving into one-stop shops for financial services. Looking ahead 10 years, I foresee banking becoming even more streamlined for everyday transactions, while complex interactions will remain personalised and relationship-focused.

How do you differentiate yourself from the consumer business director at the next bank?

Purpose is key to differentiation. Honestly, people don’t care about banking as much as bankers think they do. How many times did you think about banks yesterday? Our customer stories are far more important than the financial products we offer. Banking can feel generic without the human touch; it’s about how we make people feel, not just what we offer.

Outside of your role, I have learnt that you host a jazz show, being not much of a jazz person, tell us more about it.

(Laughs) I love jazz music — it’s my alter ego. Occasionally, one of the local media houses invites me to host a jazz radio show. Jazz music is timeless. Tunes developed in the 1930s still resonate today, Half of that music is probably 80, or 90 years old, but you would never tell because jazz was improvised with a little emotion and intellect, a fusion of instruments, and over time that still means something very personal to people. Almost 95 percent of it is unspoken, allowing listeners to engage with the music through its instruments and unique compositions.

"Coffee sector reforms boost prices but stall sales, exports","Reforms in the coffee industry, spearheaded by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua’s office, have marginally boosted the pricing of the commodity but are yet to deliver an improvement in the volume of production, sale, and export shipments.

The Coffee Sub-Sector Reforms Secretariat says coffee growers now fetch about 10 percent more for their coffee, with a 50-kilogramme bag now selling at an average of $227 (Sh29,373), from about $195 (Sh25,233) a year ago.

“We have witnessed notable and tangible progress with enhanced productivity, improved market access, and stringent quality control measures,” said Simon Chelugui, cabinet secretary for Cooperatives and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development, who chairs the reforms committee.

“The results are already evident, with increased yields and earnings, improved auction participation, enhanced traceability, and origin farmer linkages.” But the results are not all glam. There has been a decline in the volume of coffee sold at the local auction or directly to clients, as well as in quantities exported, following reforms that have been in effect for about a year.

Data by the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) shows that the country’s coffee exports dropped by 24 percent from 28,852 tonnes in the year to May 2023 to about 21,978 tonnes in the year to May 2024.

At the same time, the country’s coffee exports brought in $147 million (Sh19 billion) in foreign exchange in the 12 months to May this year, a seven percent decline from the $158 million (Sh20 billion) the commodity fetched in a similar period a year before.

The efforts to reinvigorate the Nairobi Coffee Exchange to serve farmers’ needs better have also not improved tradings at the commodity bourse. This year, 30,477 tonnes of coffee were bought at the sale down from last year’s 32,038 tonnes.

However, the reduced quantity fetched a much higher price, with the value sold at the bourse this year rising 9.5 percent to $138 million (Sh17.8 billion), from last year’s $125 million (Sh16.3 billion), reflecting a rise that farmers get in the market.

Read: How to rescue Kenya's coffee sector

According to Mr Chelugui, among the reforms in the coffee exchange include introducing a reserve price, below which coffee cannot be sold at allowing farmers better prices for their beans.

With the war on market middlemen that were accused of exploiting farmers, the quantity of coffee directly sold has dropped by 91 percent this year, from last year’s 9,100 tonnes to 822 tonnes currently.

Direct sales fetched farmers only $5.12 million (Sh662 million) in the year to May 2024, down from last year’s $42.27 million (Sh5.5 billion), a drop of over 88 percent.

Mr Chelugui said the efforts to rid the market of middlemen were necessary to improve farmer earnings, as market brokers had been accustomed to giving farmers lower prices and selling at much higher prices in the international market.

MPs demand new revival strategy from limping KQ,"MPs have ordered national carrier, Kenya Airways to draw up a fresh recovery plan that will also show how taxpayers will recover billions of shillings spent over the years to keep the airlines afloat.

The Debt and Privatisation Committee of the National Assembly gave KQ a one-month deadline to submit the report. This (deadline) will be upon adoption of the directive by lawmakers.

Kenya Airways has over the years been heavily relying on taxpayers for bailouts to pay loans and fund operations, with the expenditure crossing the Sh100 billion mark in four years.

The airline is in the red financially even as it narrowed losses to Sh22.6 billion in the year ended December, down from Sh38.2 billion a year earlier.

“Within 30 days of the adoption of this report, Kenya Airways PLC should submit to the National Assembly, a realistic and comprehensive report on its turn-around strategy and measures in place to replenish the public resources utilised in the payment of the guaranteed debt, cash bailouts, and expenses relating to the debt assumed by the National Assembly,” the committee says.

Demands for a fresh strategic plan come as KQ pursues a potential strategic investor while the government is also keen to privatize the airline in a bid to end reliance on taxpayers for bailouts.



The National Treasury spent Sh17.4 billion between July last year and March to service a debt that it had guaranteed KQ from a US lender. This is in addition to Sh83.1 billion spent on the loan and capital injection to the airlines between July 2020 and June last year. KQ tapped a $641.49 million (Sh83.41billion) 12-year-loan from Citi Bank and JP Morgan in 2017, before the Private Export Funding Corporation of the US (Pefco) took it over, with the US Exim Bank and the National Treasury joining as guarantors.

Kenya Airways took up the loan to finance the purchase of seven aircraft and an engine but failed to fully service the debt due to cash flow challenges linked to disruptions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Treasury’s guarantee covered $525 million (Sh68.3 million), which is now being serviced fully until maturity by the taxpayer after the government converted the guarantee to external commercial public debt.

Read: State clears half of Kenya Airways' guaranteed debt

A string of losses has forced KQ to cling on to the Treasury for financial support bailouts that have attracted criticism even as the government mulls a way out for the airlines.

The National Treasury had earlier told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it expected KQ to get a strategic investor by the end of June 2024.

Concurrently, the government is also mulling the privatisation of KQ by merging it with other target companies and setting up a fund to manage them.

It remains unclear on the progress or lack of it on the two proposals.

"Finland, Kenya ties to boost Africa trade","Finland’s transformation from an agriculture-based economy to an innovation powerhouse is an example of resilience. Emerging from a devastating civil war, and later defending ourselves against the Soviet Union, we rebuilt our nation. Some of the key elements in Finland’s development have been opening our economy and fostering trade, and recognising its critical importance.

We began with initial steps and modest means. An education policy – basic education for all – was established just four years after gaining independence, followed later by a science policy and the expansion of universities, which created the base for innovation policy underpinned by research innovation and investments.

Other founding elements needed to create a conducive business environment were good governance, trust in political and social institutions, a predictable legal system, inclusion of women, respect for human rights and openness to new ideas.

Central to our success has been a firm belief in free trade. Trade liberalisation has played a pivotal role in shaping Finland into the modern welfare state it is today. It has driven economic growth, generated tax revenues, benefited consumers, created employment opportunities, attracted investments, fostered innovation, and enhanced competitiveness.

Finland’s economy has traditionally been driven by exports. The ability to trade freely has facilitated the import of capital goods and technology, which has been essential for Finland’s industrialisation. Free trade agreements concluded between the European Union (EU) and other countries have allowed Finnish companies to access larger markets, ultimately contributing to the nation’s prosperity.

Key characteristics of today’s Finnish innovation system are intense public-private partnerships, a consensus mentality among different and often competing parts of society, good public governance, and networking among companies, universities, and research organisations. Public-private partnerships and free trade are mutually reinforcing.

Looking ahead, Finland is committed to doubling trade with Africa by 2030, with Kenya emerging as a pivotal partner in achieving this goal. Especially since the beginning of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, Finnish companies have been increasingly looking for new markets.

Making African markets more accessible benefits both the Kenyans and Finns. Kenya is seen as an increasingly attractive destination for Finnish companies and investment facilities.

The potential of regional trade in East Africa is still largely underutilised. Finland seeks to unlock the regional growth potential and create opportunities for Finnish companies through its support to regional organisations, such as TradeMark Africa.

Finland has been committed to TradeMark’s work for more than 10 years already. As part of my visit here in Kenya, we will be announcing our renewed support for TradeMark Africa: 12 million euros of core funding over the next four years. Finland is proud to be part of this success story of economic integration.

Earlier this year, Kenya signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU as the first country in East Africa. This guarantees Kenyan goods quota-free and duty-free access to the European market.

The agreement is open for other countries in the region to join, which we warmly welcome.

Through the EU´s Global Gateway investment strategy, we channel public and private investments to support Kenya in its ambition to boost digitalisation and develop a green, sustainable economy.

Simply creating business opportunities is not sufficient. An enabling regulatory framework plays a crucial role in fostering a conducive business environment by ensuring transparency, fairness, and stability.

A more predictable business environment will spur private sector growth, attract more foreign direct investment, and enhance the potential for trade with companies. Moreover, it is imperative that environmental aspects are considered, ensuring sustainable development and responsible business practices.

More business

For Finland, the ‘leave no one behind’ policy has yielded returns in many ways. A well-functioning society necessitates a healthy and dynamic economy free from corruption. We commend Kenya’s efforts to progressively enhance trade, investment, and regulatory regimes for the EU to invest and engage in more business.

It took more than 50 years for Finland to change from an agriculture-based, marginal Northern European economy into one of the most innovative, technologically driven and knowledge-intensive economies.

Many steps were taken and tested without absolute certainty of where they would lead or how good the results would be. With hindsight, the above outlined lessons can be learnt from our journey.

As we continue to navigate the complexities of the modern world, Finland stands ready to share its experiences and collaborate with partners like Kenya in shaping a prosperous future for all.

Standoff as cane farmers decline to repay Sh3.7bn State loans,"The government is on the verge of losing Sh3.7 billion as sugarcane farmers refuse to repay loans issued to them, while local politicians ran a campaign that the loans were written off, the Auditor-General has warned.

Through the Commodities Fund- which is mandated with providing affordable loans to farmers for improvement, farm inputs, and operations- the government issued loans to growers through two co-operatives and a sugar miller.

The Kisumu Sugar Belt Co-operative Union owes the Fund Sh134.3 million while the Muhoroni Multipurpose Co-operative Union and the Muhoroni Sugar Company Sh 88.8 million and Sh3.47 billion, respectively.

“Most of the outstanding loans given to farmers were given as social grants with no securities and as such, recovery of these loans by the out-grower companies from the farmers has become almost impossible over the years,” Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu notes in a report on Commodities Fund.

Ms Gathungu notes that with politicians sustaining a narrative that the government has written off the loans issued without security, the farmers are adamant about repaying them and are now delivering sugarcane to other millers to avoid being deducted.

“Political utterances have created conflicts between the sugarcane farmers and the saccos as well as the fund. Farmers are capitalising on utterances made to the effect that the outstanding loans have been written off by the Government of Kenya. Hence, they refuse to pay or find ways of evading loan recoveries by delivering their canes to other milling factories that have no loan commitments with them,” the report notes.

Kisumu Sugar Belt Co-operative Union is made up of 80 active co-operative societies while Muhoroni Multipurpose Co-operative Union consists of 15 active co-operative societies. The audit notes that the two unions are in operation and are actively involved with farmers.

“However, they have been defaulting on loan repayment to their respective unions which in turn has caused the unions to default on Fund’s (Commodities Fund) loans,” the audit notes.

Kenya's child malaria deaths fall three-fold on campaigns,"The number of children under five years dying from malaria in Kenya has dropped by about three-fold since the introduction of the US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) indicating a positive trend towards reducing deaths by 21 per 1,000 live births by 2030.

PMI is an initiative of the US State and strives to cut the burden of malaria in 30 countries in Africa, including Kenya, and help ease poverty. It works with partner countries to scale up proven interventions and strengthen local capacity and health systems, and also invest in research and new tools to combat malaria.

According to the PMI Report 2024, the under-five mortality rate from malaria in Kenya has fallen from 11.5 percent in 2003 to 4.1 percent in 2022. This decline was driven by reductions in high-burden, lake-endemic districts, where PMI focuses more than 70 percent of its efforts and resources.

Kenya is a priority country for PMI, with over $530 million (Sh68.53 billion) invested since 2006. “PMI is continuing to find new ways to drive toward our objectives to reduce malaria cases and deaths as outlined in PMI’s Strategy 2021-2026. We are tailoring programs to meet the needs of each country and supporting local leadership to end malaria faster.

Given what I see accomplished every day through PMI’s programs in Africa and Asia, I believe it is possible to end malaria in our lifetime. With U.S. leadership and robust global commitment, we can turn the vision of a malaria-free world into a reality,” said David Walton, US Global Malaria coordinator.

The reduction in Kenya is attributed to progress in critical areas, including ownership and access to insecticide-treated bed nets, their use for children under five, indoor residual spraying, rapid diagnostic tests, and use of artemisinin-based combination therapies.

Brookside farmer reward payouts up 54pc to Sh 218m,"Farmers contracted by milk processor Brookside Dairy have been paid Sh218 million in the half-year to May, under a scheme that rewards producers for milk quality and surpassing supply targets.

The latest payout, which represents a 53.5 percent jump over the previous year’s, will benefit dairy groups and individual farmers across the country who signed up for the programme and have been supplying raw milk to Brookside during the six months between December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024.

“The beneficiary farmer groups and individual suppliers signed up for our reward scheme and were given raw milk supply targets, for both quantity and quality. We are rewarding these farmers as a recognition of their hard work over the six-month period,” Emmanuel Kabaki, Brookside’s General Manager for milk procurement said.

The farmer reward scheme was pioneered by Brookside six years ago as it sought to appreciate the critical role raw milk suppliers play in the upstream phase of the dairy value chain. The payout has been appreciating over the years, as the processor’s base of contracted farmers continues to expand.

“The reward further cements our excellent working relationship with all our 160,000 raw milk suppliers across the country. It has boosted the supply of high-quality milk, thus enabling us to tap into a larger share of high-value products,” Mr. Kabaki added.

Thousands of dairy farmers have benefited from Brookside’s extension services, which include field day training and the use of demonstration farms to showcase best practices in the dairy enterprise.

The processor has also been working with farmers to establish fodder for dairy cows, besides working on breed genetic improvement through support with semen straws. It has also been engaging farmers in afforestation initiatives, to ensure sustainable dairy production through increased tree cover.

Airtel expands into home Internet space,"Airtel is set to rival players in Kenya’s home internet market that has remained under the tight grip of Safaricom, with new broadband services targeting users in their homes and businesses.

Dubbed the ‘Unlimited Home Broadband’ offering, the product is also set to rival those of other major operators, including Jamii Telecommunications Limited (JTL) and Wananchi Group-owned Zuku.

As of the close of last December, Safaricom dominated the market with a 36.7 percent market share, followed by JTL and Zuku at 23.7 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, according to data from the Communications Authority of Kenya.

Airtel’s offering comes with a portable router meaning the internet is not fixed--a shift the telco claimed would guarantee consumers better and uninterrupted connectivity.



“We are pleased to introduce Airtel Kenya’s Unlimited Plans. They signify our commitment to providing unmatched connectivity solutions and embody our vision for individuals and businesses empowered by seamless connectivity,” said Airtel Kenya managing director Ashish Malhotra.

The fifth generation (5G)-enabled router has been touted as a potential solution to the slow uptake of the super-fast network service on the premise that it will eliminate the need for users to acquire the highly-priced 5G-ready smartphones, a factor that has kept the service out of the reach of many.

Currently, most 5G-supported phones are mid to high-end devices that include the Samsung Galaxy S and Fold series, Huawei and Oppo 5G devices among others, retailing from Sh25,000 to over Sh150,000.

The country’s second-largest telco unveiled the 5G mobile broadband network mid-last year, months after Safaricom had launched the service in October 2022.

Airtel says that it has, during the one year, doubled its 5G footprint from 372 sites in 16 counties it had at the launch to over 690 covering 39 counties to date.

End men’s silent struggle with mental ill-health,"World Health Organization (WHO) data show one in eight men experiences symptoms of mental health problems as compared to one in five women. And Kenya National Bureau of Statistics says, compared to women, men are three times more likely to commit suicide.

Most men are tied down by the traditional ‘strong male’ stereotype, making them ignore their well-being and decide to address their mental health status. Men register lower mental health treatment rates as most men choose to ‘go tough’ on the issue.

In Kenya, 25 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, of outpatients and inpatients suffer from mental health conditions such as depression, substance abuse, stress and anxiety disorders.

Males are likely to see doctors about the physical symptoms of the conditions as they prefer self-medication with alcohol and other substances. Hence he will say “I have learnt how to deal with it”, consider sharing their problems as a burden to others or afraid to admit they need help.

The traditional masculinity norms, such as stigma around expressing emotions, also contribute negatively to men’s mental ill-health. Society sees as weak men who don’t ‘man up’.

At times, men with mental health problems find it hard to access healthcare services due to the high cost of seeing a psychiatrist or therapist and also transport.

To end the silent struggles and break the mental health stigma, the authorities should launch national campaigns to create awareness of the dire situation and create educational programmes based on mental health. Involving communities in the activities would help to break stereotypes around the retrogressive masculine behaviours.

Second opinion • On the ban on the stimulant muguka in the coastal counties of Mombasa and Kilifi, Mwangi Karuga says, a critical voice is conspicuously missing. “I would only listen to the medical doctors on its suitability; otherwise, I wouldn’t go by the views of some laymen like myself.

Private sector vital in training for the construction industry,"Every other week, Xyverian Chuma’s motorcycle tears across western Kenya, travelling between construction sites up to 100 kilometres apart in Kitale, Kisumu and Kisii. The demand for skilled plumbers in these areas is immense but the supply remains woefully inadequate.

A private contractor, Chuma embarked on his plumbing career as an apprentice at Allied Plumbers. Established in 1963, this family business has grown into a multinational plumbing firm with operations in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, earning numerous awards for its industry excellence.

Chuma is among hundreds of skilled workers who completed apprenticeship training and passed trade tests for plumbers. But the process is not fast enough to meet the national demand for skilled labour. Despite the emphasis on practical skills in the 8-4-4 education system, school leavers have historically been steered toward university degrees, neglecting vocational and technical education.

In response, technical and vocational colleges transitioned into university constituent colleges or standalone universities without being replaced in their former training roles. This led to an oversupply of graduates who struggled to find jobs, while the private sector, especially the construction industry, faced a severe shortage of skilled workers. Companies suffered reduced profitability, lower productivity and compromised work quality.

On-the-job training

To address this, the private sector began offering on-the-job training. But this approach was often insufficient to address the systemic nationwide skills deficit. The shift in the official education policy to support technical and vocational education and training (TVET) has driven initiatives to cultivate a highly skilled construction workforce, fuelling broader economic prosperity.

These efforts are most effective when complemented by active private sector engagement.

Countries with successful Dual TVET programmes, like Switzerland, involve the private sector in the design and delivery of vocational training. Its private sector, a key factor in the country’s economic success, plays a significant role in vocational training, producing a well-qualified workforce and maintaining low youth unemployment rates.

My involvement in Swisscontact’s PropelA dual apprenticeship programme, launched in Kenya in 2022, has highlighted the importance of collaboration in delivering effective TVET programmes. The participation of industry, with the National Industrial Training Authority (Nita) accrediting firms, aligns the curriculum with industry needs, addressing both current and future demands.



By exposing apprentices and their trainers to real-world work in 35 companies in Nairobi, we aim to replicate the Swiss model, bridging the gap between classroom instruction and practical training. The programme’s structure includes three weeks of on-the-job training and one week of vocational training over 18 months. The trainees acquire high-demand technical skills in electrical fitting and plumbing.

Dual TVET system

A robust Dual TVET system benefits all stakeholders. Companies gain access to a skilled workforce, training institutions expose their trainers and trainees to real work experience and aspiring entrepreneurs acquire the needed skills and confidence. Young people gain employability and income opportunities and industry an overall improvement in quality.

A collaborative approach between the government, private sector and TVET institutions can achieve the long-term goal of skills training, providing dignified jobs that empower young people to control their future. This will lead to a more productive, efficient and competitive economy. Further investments by the government and education institutions in quality TVET programmes, along with active private sector involvement, can bridge Kenya’s skills gap and build a future-proof workforce.

Fallacy of ‘one man one shilling’ formula in resource allocation,"Propagated by some central Kenya politicians, a contentious concept of “one man, one shilling” budget allocation, which argues that counties should receive national funds in direct proportion to their economic output, as measured by gross value added (GVA), has dominated political discourse in the country lately.

On the surface, this proposal carries an alluring simplicity—those who produce more should receive more.

However, the ‘one man, one shilling’ model, when subjected to rigorous analysis, reveals itself to be a deeply flawed and potentially damaging approach to national budgeting.

To understand the limitations of this argument, we must first examine the county-level GVA data itself.

The figures, as per Kenya National Bureau of Statistics GVA data 2018-2022, paint a picture of a nation with stark economic disparities. Nairobi emerges as the titan of productivity, single-handedly generating 27.5 percent of Kenya’s total output. The central Kenya counties, while certainly punching above their weight, trail far behind—Kiambu at 5.7 percent, Nyeri at two percent, Murang’a at two percent, and Kirinyaga at 1.3 percent. While these numbers exceed the national county average of around 2.4 percent, they hardly establish central Kenya as the singular engine of our economy.

Yet, even if we were to accept the premise that economic output should dictate budget allocations, the “one man one shilling” argument stumbles when confronted with the complexities of equitable resource distribution. It ignores the crucial distinction between a county’s output and its needs.

Less developed counties, though their GVA contributions may be modest, often require disproportionate investments in public services, infrastructure, and development initiatives to bridge the gap. Allocating funds based solely on economic performance would entrench regional disparities, leaving struggling counties perpetually behind.

As we navigate the intricacies of resource allocation, let us resist the temptation of easy answers and political point-scoring. Let us instead embrace a thoughtful, nuanced approach—one that recognises our diversity as a strength, not a weakness. By crafting a budget that balances economic realities with principles of fairness and equity, we can build a Kenya that works for all its citizens, from the highlands of central to the coast of the Indian Ocean.

When companies need all hands on deck in era of extreme turmoil,"

Kenya and the world is undergoing a tough economic cycle with high interest rates and inflation affecting the cost of doing business and the rates of consumption.

This is coming on the back of Covid- 19 aftershocks, supply chain dislocations, geopolitical turmoil, surging energy costs and volatility in local currency exchange rates.

This period of extreme turmoil has tested private sector resilience leaving businesses vulnerable. The toxic mix of headwinds have barraged businesses with multiple challenges forcing them to ask their financers, suppliers and sometimes even employees onto the negotiating table to restructure their commitments for their long term survival.

When a business undergoes a rough patch, the stakeholders in its ecosystem face the stark choice of whether to try and recover what is left of the enterprise, or to trust the long term vision of the business to weather turbulence.

But these conversations are never easy, remember the first inclination for the business is the profit motive and lenders, suppliers, partners just like any business are inclined to increase returns to their own shareholders. For them, restructuring may mean delayed anticipated incomes, which may impact their overall performance.

However, the alternative could mean default, and collapse of the business gutting their profits in provisioning, and draining more resources in litigation and recovery only to line up with a long list of claimants splitting hairs.

The most rational way out is to assess the pros and cons of alternative options to decide whether or not to save the business and most importantly how to safeguard value.

It will need courage to begin these conversations but they have to happen, bankers, suppliers and all creditors and business need to sit and look at the reality on the ground. The best bet is to seek for restructuring especially if the conditions are favorable.

If there is strong governance, a model or clear business strategy that is scalable, a strong management team able to execute, and finally, the key stakeholders or financiers aligned all through the journey to create a sustainable business, then it should be given an opportunity to rebuild.

This restructuring conversation will be the difference between companies that collapse and those that move from the brink of bankruptcy and closure to become the Apple, Netflix, General Motors and Delta Airlines of today, which recovered from a similar position.

While the four businesses mentioned above had different challenges, there is something we can learn from their approach to turning around these units into becoming the industry giants they are today.

First, is the need to really rethink the basic aspects of the business starting with the business idea itself and the business model. It is also advisable to review every single aspect of the business – just as if one was starting the business step-by-step from scratch.

The turnaround strategy is a result of finding out what went wrong and assessing the current situation, including the prevailing market environment. While putting together the plan, one has to put in consideration the important technological advancements, industry regulations and government policies that may work in favour of or against the direction a business wants to go as it seeks to turn itself around.

They may influence whether a business will venture into a new line of production or service offering, expand to a new market or even withdraw a product or service from the market. Management plays an integral role in turnarounds. Having a team with experience, deep understanding of operational and technical expertise goes a long way in revitalizing a business.

It is also important to ensure that the team within the organization buy into the new vision and are not only ready but also capable of steering the organization towards its next phase. This may involve training, promotions, realignments and in some cases bringing in new hands. Achieving buy-in from the team will require the leadership to effectively communicate the problem, involve them in formulating the solutions, work with the team in creating a clear vision of where the business is heading and empower the team that will do the actual work.

The next phase involves engaging external stakeholders. These include banks, suppliers, tax authorities and large customers. Often, business problems that require turnaround strategies have an impact on their finances. This makes it difficult for them to service debt, raise working capital and meet tax obligations. A good strategy must clearly outline how a business intends to meet its financial obligations to the various stakeholders.

This could include restructuring debt to allow for longer repayment periods while allowing the business to access capital to fund its order books, converting debts into equity, lowering production costs by improving efficiency and creative fundraising.

Need to boost investment in health research and development,"Kenya is at a critical juncture on health research and development (R&D). A recent report by the Ministry of Health and Coalition for Health Research and Development (CHReaD) shows slow yet positive growth over the past five years. However, the landscape is fraught with challenges that need urgent redress to harness the full potential of health innovations. From 2019 to 2023, Kenya invested Sh90 billion ($560 million) in health R&D.

This represents a modest increase in spending as a percentage of GDP, climbing from 0.17 per cent to 0.22 per cent. Yet, these numbers barely scratch the surface of the national commitment to allocate at least 0.6 per cent of GDP to this very important area. This commitment is echoed in international pledges and the vision outlined in legislative frameworks such as the Health Act, 2017 and the Science, Technology and Innovation Act.

Despite the ambitious targets, the deployment of resources reveals a stark reliance on external funding with 75 per cent of health R&D investments sourced from international donors. This dependency underscores a critical vulnerability—our health research agenda is at the mercy of external priorities and fluctuations in global funding streams.

Commendable strides

Moreover, county governments’ involvement in health R&D remains nascent—although some have made commendable strides in setting up institutional structures for research, including research units and ethical review boards. Only about 28 per cent of counties reported expenditure on health-related R&D with allocations rarely exceeding 0.02 per cent of their health budgets.

The private sector’s engagement is equally fraught with challenges. Despite some landmark investments, such as Moderna’s initiative for developing mRNA vaccines in Kenya, bureaucratic hurdles and high costs associated with clinical trials deter broader investment. More transparent regulatory frameworks and better incentives, including tax reliefs, could catalyse private investment in health R&D. The development of HIV prevention gels and new rapid diagnostic tests for malaria are testaments to what can be achieved with targeted investment and collaboration.

The path forward requires a solid strategy to increase domestic funding for health R&D. This strategy should include redefining budgetary allocations to reflect genuine research activities rather than masking them under broad budget lines. Furthermore, a concerted effort to build capacity in the counties, engage more with the private sector and streamline regulatory processes will be essential.

For Kenya to achieve its health and development goals, particularly universal health coverage (UHC), a recalibration of our approach to health R&D investment is important. We must shift from an over-reliance on external funding to a more sustainable model that leverages increased domestic financing and private sector innovation. Only then can we truly harness the power of research to address the health challenges our nation faces.

Protect security facilities,"Building approvals in the urban centres ensure order and safety. The capital city, Nairobi, has had an elaborate approvals system that worked quite well. Where contractors are found to have violated regulations, the structures are simply demolished. However, the proliferation of buildings appearing to contravene guidelines means that those charged with the approvals are sleeping on the job.

There is impressive investment in building construction in Eastleigh. Commercial and residential highrise buildings are coming up in large numbers in the vibrant suburb. But those putting up the properties must follow the guidelines.

Some have been rattled by President William Ruto’s declaration that he will ensure Moi Air Base, in the neighbourhood, is protected. All security installations must be secured against encroachment by private developers. This being a military facility, the regulations on the height of buildings near it must be strictly enforced. Hopefully, the approvals were proper.

City county building approvals must be based on standards agreed with Kenya Air Force and the Kenya Defence Forces. Some people stand to lose their huge investments, but the safety of security installations must never be compromised.

The developers are alarmed and the uncertainty is frustrating. However, security facilities must be protected by enforcing compliance with the building heights regulations. This is a delicate balance between national security, on the one hand, and lucrative trade and investment, on the other hand.

Having tall buildings near a military air base is risky, especially in these days of rampant terrorism. If any approvals were unprocedurally given, the buildings should be demolished, the culpable officials punished and owners compensated.

Another option is to relocate the air base, which has since been encircled by commercial and residential properties, to allow the suburb to thrive.

A national audit of all such security installations is urgent.

Ways to mitigate challenges Kenyan startups are facing,"As East Africa’s leading economic powerhouse, Kenyan small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in the development of the economy. They are the engines for a country’s economic growth.

A recent National Economic Survey report by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) indicated that SMEs constitute 98 percent of all businesses in Kenya, creating 30 percent of the jobs annually as well as contributing three percent of Kenya's GDP.

Startups and SMEs in Kenya are making significant contributions in various sectors, including technology, agriculture, finance, health, and education and are transforming the business landscape in the country.

On the other hand, the government has been at the forefront in supporting SME startups through the enactment of laws and regulations, creating a favourable business environment that favours SMEs and access to skilled labour that has created a conducive ecosystem for entrepreneurship to thrive. Moreover, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Index 2019, Kenya was ranked 68th out of 137 countries, reflecting its strong entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Despite the contributions and the roles that SMEs play in Kenya, they have faced numerous challenges that have become a hindrance to their growth. Let us look at their challenges and ways how we can mitigate them.

First, many SMEs and start-ups in Kenya don’t have enough training and management practices to run their businesses. They lack knowledge of the importance of operations and processes and the role that each plays in the business.

Business owners need to have the correct knowledge that will help them deal with the external output by creating a conducive working environment for retaining their top talents who contribute their skills to bring more returns to the company.

Second, a business model is a company's core strategy for profitably doing business. They determine the impact of the business in the market. Many start-ups fail because they have the wrong business model.

Business owners should ensure that the business model aligns with the company’s overall strategy. One of the things that start-ups need to check is selecting a business model that is not too complex and that’s sustainable. The business model should be sustainable and scalable to ensure that the business has a chance to succeed.

Third, access to the market is a crucial aspect for startups. It influences their growth, sustainability and success. Many businesses have utilised the digital space as a safe spot for marketing their products. While digital marketing serves as a great tool for reaching a wider audience, many startups face challenges in determining their target audience clearly and precisely.

Without knowing your ideal customers, their needs and how they make decisions, you will waste time and money on marketing campaigns that don't resonate with them.

To avoid this mistake, they should conduct proper market research, create buyer personas, and segment their audience based on relevant criteria.

Fourth, the only way to stand out from the competition is by establishing a cutting-edge business while being relatable and within reach in terms of access and prices. Knowledge of your competitors and understanding your unique value proposition is crucial if you want to outgrow the competition. Understanding customers' needs and adapting to them makes you stay ahead of the competition.

Fifth, many startups fail because they are unable to keep up with the changing laws and legislation. To solve this challenge, they need to keep updated on the new laws that affect their industries. They also need to have a legal representative who will ensure they are updated and who will work with them in customising their products to suit the legal requirements

In short, startups and SMEs have the potential to boost national productivity and transform the economy. However, the challenges addressed above if not hindered will stifle the growth of businesses and companies which will affect the country’s economy. Root your SME in practical, rather than theoretical, knowledge and watch your business grow.

Protect children under-five,"The importance of children under five years building immunity against diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), measles, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus cannot be overemphasised. It is shocking that news reports are indicating that public hospitals do not have the required vaccines for the under-fives.

A child, from birth, should be helped to build immunity against these killer diseases and a whole range of others through immunisation for their bodies to acquire the strength to fight these diseases. Active and passive immunity is crucial.

Kenya has made huge strides in immunisation. Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunisation (Kepi) has, since the 1980s, ensured the expansion of immunisation of the under-fives and the safety and longevity of the vaccines through the cold chain process, especially in the rural areas.

The worrying reports of lack of vaccines should be cause for alarm. No child should be denied this vital cog in the early years of its development.

The Ministry of Health, through the Cabinet Secretary, Susan Nakhumicha Wafula, has dismissed the reports as inaccurate. Visits to hospitals, however, indicate the opposite. We should not go back to those years when children relied on natural immunisation through getting infected or mother’s anti-bodies being passed to the foetus before birth. Artificial-induced immunisation is a must when one considers the current environment.

The lack of a clean and healthy environment provides the ideal environment for micro-organisms to thrive. Remember, the vigorous global campaign against small-pox culminated in its eradication.

We must not allow a return to the era of the six child killer diseases of the 1960s and ‘70s, when polio ruled the world. Let all children get the jab.

Need to end the row over retired President’s dues,"President William Ruto and his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, yesterday met to discuss an ugly development that should never have arisen in the first place. The former President and his successor should, of course, be holding consultations. But this is not why they have had to come together.

There is a simmering row over Mr Kenyatta’s retirement benefits. The two leaders have not been on good terms as Mr Kenyatta supported President Ruto’s rival in the August 8, 2022 General Election. The bad blood has continued well over a year since the incumbent took office.

The hitch over the dues is uncalled for as this is defined in the Constitution. Mr Kenyatta’s grievances include an alleged refusal by State House to disburse Sh1 billion to him and a standoff over the location of the retired President’s office.

The two leaders have reportedly agreed to address the grievances. It is commendable that the ground has now been laid to end this embarrassing and totally unnecessary development. Actually, there is even no need for discussions and personal concessions or favouritism to comply with constitutional provisions. Provisions of the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, must be followed to the letter.

Compliance with the Constitution is not optional or conditional. There is absolutely no basis to deny the holder of the top office in the land rights and privileges spelt out by the supreme law. This is a gross violation of the Constitution that should never be condoned. The only way the former President’s retirement dues can be denied is to amend particular sections or the entire Constitution to that effect.

Constitutional provisions are not personal favours to be dispensed from the generosity or benevolence of whoever is charge with executing them. In the past, former Vice-President Kalonzo Musyoka and ex-Prime Minister Raila Odinga have been asked to stop engaging in politics for their pensions to be paid. This is illegal. Nobody has the powers to do that.

Ours is a nation that prides itself in constitutionalism. Fidelity to the supreme law of the land is mandatory.

How do I make my second marriage work?,"Dear Kitoto

I got separated from my wife three years ago. She had several affairs during our 10-year marriage and we finally called it quits. She filed for divorce and we are waiting for the paperwork to be finalised.

A few months ago, I met another woman and we fell in love with each other. We feel it is time to take things to the next level but I am haunted by the problems I faced in my first marriage. What if this new marriage fails as well?

Hi,

There are a few issues we need to look at. First is whether you have processed well all that you have been through in your previous marriage. There could be things you wished you did differently and therefore cause you emotional pain and regret. Or there could be stuff that hurt you deeply that you did not take time to settle with your former wife. Such issues left unresolved could stay in the subconscious and affect your future relationships. The affair she had could be part of what causes your apprehension or a feeling of betrayal.

In a relationship of 10 years, unresolved issues and crashed expectations can be many. When these are not tamed and they lead to divorce, it can leave one with the emotional baggage of many unanswered questions.

Second, it is, therefore, important to identify what your exact fears are and how they can be resolved. Some unresolved baggage may never get answers because the person who hurt you is gone. For example, her unfaithfulness is something that bothered you. If this is not processed well, it can cause emotional baggage. Or maybe it is about your capacity to manage the issues that crop up in marriage. Whatever the case, identifying and processing issues that bothered you in the relationship helps you remain focused. Baggage has a way of clouding our perception of the future.

I pray that you seek healing and systematically work through issues fully to avoid carrying over any undealt baggage to your new relationship.

Avoid fear

Also, to process the new path you are taking and avoid fear, what are some of the hidden effects in the former relationship that could threaten the current one?

Marriage is something that is left to an individual as they submit to their values, faith, responsibilities, and conviction. There are times when some spouses choose to stay single and raise the child(ren) while others choose to re-marry for mutual support and encouragement after a divorce. After a divorce, the bitter and difficult past must be handled well and brought to a conclusion. I don't know whether you have taken the time to consider all these issues and handle them well before proceeding with finalising the divorce.

Read: I love older women, but for acceptance, I need to marry a younger wife

In retrospection moving past moments of relational crisis can be turned around positively to help rebuild, reinforce, and strengthen pillars that would lead to a long-term relationship. This is so when the man and woman commit to a journey to readily confront and fix the problems that brought about the crisis in the first place. Therefore, bringing intelligence to the way we relate early in the relationship is the only way we can overcome hurdles and move toward building trust and lasting companionship.

This will mean that every couple bridges any appearance of disconnect between needs and how they reflect on the overall performance of the relationship. When we do this, we treat each other as equal partners. This is what makes either partner feel needed, valued, and accepted in the relationship.

We need to create an environment where both partners feel safe around each other. Such support helps us never to give up. When it is easier to dispose of the other person, true support brings their need as individuals to the spotlight for our attention.

"Kenya, Cote d’Ivoire share the spoils in World Cup qualifier","Kenya settled for a scoreless draw with African champions Cote d’Ivoire in a 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier on Tuesday evening in Lilongwe, Malawi.

This was the second match that Harambee Stars have drawn in the qualifiers within a space of four days.

On Friday, Harambee Stars, who are using Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe as their home ground, were held to a 1-1 draw by Burundi.

Kenya remains third in Group 'F' with five points from four matches.

African champions Cote d’Ivoire leads the group with 10 points having won three matches and drawn one.

Gabon, who have played three matches, are second with six points from two wins and a loss.

Burundi, The Gambia and Seychelles, who have all played three matches, have four, three and zero points respectively.

This was the first meeting ever between the two nations.

Having won all their three previous matches of the group, and boasting of several European-based players, the Elephants came into the match as the favourites.

However, Harambee Stars put up a spirited fight to bring to a halt the African champions' winning streak.

In fact, Kenya could have upset Cote d’Ivoire had they capitalised on the numerous scoring opportunities they created.

Harambee Stars head coach Engin Firat made only one change from the side that started against Burundi with defender Alphonce Omija replacing Clifton Miheso.

On the other hand, the Elephants made five changes from the match, including the exclusion of Borussia Dortmund forward Sebastian Haller who missed the match due to injury. Haller failed to train with the rest of the team on Tuesday.

The match’s first shot on target arrived in the 28th minute when Kenyan captain Michael Olunga tasted Cote d’Ivoire’s goalkeeper Yahia Fofana with a free-kick from outside the box.

Stars were awarded the foul after Rooney Onyango was brought down after latching on a long pass.

Three minutes later, the Gor Mahia right-back again caused trouble for Cote d’Ivoire when he dribbled into the box, only for his cross to go begging.

Moments later, Cote d’Ivoire missed a great opportunity when an unmarked Seko Fofana fired wide after connecting to a loose ball outside the box.

In the 37th minute, Olunga should have done better than hitting his low shot wide.

On the stroke of halftime, Kenya's vastly experienced goalkeeper Patrick Matasi did well by parrying wide a well-taken free-kick.

In the second half, coach Firat rested Kenneth Muguna and Timothy Ouma for Chros Erambo and Duke Abuya.

Kenya‘s best scoring chance in this half arrived in the 71st minute when Olunga’s shot was cleared off the line.

The hosts then survived a big scare in the 82nd minute when substitute Oumar Diakite hit the crossbar.

Just before the final whistle, Olunga failed to find the back of the net after he was overpowered by his marker, with his shot not troubling goalkeeper Fofana.

With no stadium presently available in Kenya to host the qualifiers, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has settled on the Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe as the venue of Harambee Stars' home matches.

At the end of the qualifiers, the nine group winners will qualify directly to the 2026 Fifa World Cup while the four best group runners-up will compete in the inter-confederation play-offs for the final slot.

"Atwoli re-elected to ILO, becomes body's longest-serving member","Central Organization of Trade Unions (Cotu) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has been re-elected for a record fifth time as a Titular Member of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Governing Body in Geneva, Switzerland.

Atwoli was re-elected during an election held on Monday at the ongoing 112th Session of the International Labour Conference.

Mr Atwoli garnered 97 votes out of 130.

This means that Mr Atwoli will continue representing workers in the ILO Governing Body for another three years.

Longest-serving member

His re-election sets a new record as he becomes the first representative to hold the position for the fifth time.

“This historic re-election not only marks my continued commitment to the international labour movement but also establishes me as the longest-serving member of the ILO Governing Body and I don’t take it for granted,” Mr Atwoli said while reacting to the news.

ILO is a United Nations agency devoted to promoting social justice and internationally recognised human and labour rights, pursuing its founding mission that labour peace is essential to prosperity.

Mr Atwoli has been the Secretary General of Cotu for more than two decades now.

“All these appointments reflect the trust that workers in Kenya, and beyond, have in me, in regards with to contributing to the governance and strategic direction of key institutions in Kenya and beyond.

Inspire positive change

""It also speaks to the broad expertise and the years of experience that I have acquired while serving workers worldwide,” Mr Atwoli said.

As he embarks on his fifth term in office, Mr Atwoli has expressed his confidence that under his leadership, he will continue to inspire positive change and advance the cause of workers’ rights on the global stage.

“As a key figure in the ongoing efforts to champion workers' rights, social justice, and economic development, I will ensure that the rights and welfare of workers, globally, are upheld and respected,” he said.

Mr Atwoli is also one of the Vice Presidents of the Global International Trade Union Confederation, Brussels (ITUC Brussels) and General Council Member of the ITUC African Regional Organisation (ITUC-A).

LSK raises alarm as fake lawyers invade North Rift,"The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has raised an alarm over the surge of fake lawyers administering marriage oaths, and transacting fraudulent property agreements and other real estate transactions in the North Rift.

According to LSK, some of the culprits work in cahoots with law firms that help them win the trust of unsuspecting clients. Some of them also use forged court documents.

LSK North Rift chapter president Henry Kenei is now calling on members of the public to be extra vigilant whenever they are seeking legal services.

“Before engaging the services of anybody who claims to be a lawyer, ask people around you to help to confirm if he or she is a genuine lawyer,” Mr Kenei said.

A law student, masquerading as a lawyer, was recently arrested for his alleged involvement in a Sh13 million fraud conspiracy.

On Monday, Dennis Kiplagat Cheruiyot, who is a student at Kenya School of Law, was charged with impersonation, issuing false documents, and conspiracy to defraud Sh13 million.

The suspect has also been charged with administering oaths in various agreements, including marriages, land sales, and financial services between members of the public and various institutions.

Mr Cheruiyot, who appeared before Eldoret Senior Principal Magistrate Peter Areri, was also charged with false swearing by pretending to be an advocate to administer oaths.

The law student is accused of administering oaths in various agreements including marriages, land sales, and financial services between members of the public and various institutions.

On the impersonation charge, the court heard that on diverse dates between August 20, 2021, and May 2024 in offices located at Kirem Arcade within Eldoret town with intent to defraud, Mr Cheruiyot pretended to be advocate Nathan Kirui, a commissioner of oaths.

The accused was charged with impersonation contrary to Section 382 of the Penal Code.

He was also charged with conspiracy to defraud. The court heard that on diverse dates between May and December 2023 at Kirem Arcade, the accused conspired with others not before the court to defraud clients seeking their services of Sh13million.

The money had been contributed by Benard Lagat, Silas Imbayi, Michael Mwasame, Sambai Caroline, Abigael Chepkoech, Leah Jelimo, Partick Simiyu and Joshua Kilah.

Mr Cheruiyot is also facing charges of forging contract agreements for financial services through Mark Premium Solution firm. He has also been charged with forgery in land sale agreements, affidavits for marriage, and land lease agreements.

The accused has also been charged with refusing to have his fingerprints taken by the police, contrary to section 55(5) of the National Police Act of 2011.

The prosecution told the court that upon his arrest on June 2, 2024, at Eldoret Police Station, the accused refused to have his fingerprints taken as required by the law.

The accused, through his lawyer Kaira Nabasenge, however, denied all the charges.

Kenya Airways plane lands safely after tyres damage,"Flights in and out of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi were on Tuesday afternoon disrupted and hundreds of passengers were stranded after a Kenya Airways (KQ) plane stalled on the single runway for one hour and 17 minutes.

KQ said in a statement Tuesday that it had diverted the Boeing 737 freighter to Nairobi after it received an alert from Sharjah International Airport in Dubai that there was tyre debris on the runway shortly after the cargo plane took off. The plane was headed for Juba, South Sudan.

“Upon arrival in Nairobi, the aircraft did an overflight, and our team ascertained that the aircraft had adequate wheels for a safe landing as only one out of six wheels was damaged,” KQ said.

During the overflight manoeuvre, pilots lowered the gear for technicians on the ground to assess the plane.

“The aircraft touched down safely at 12.55 pm local time, but while breaking and slowing down, one of the other tyres failed which made the aircraft immobilised on the runway,” the airline said.

The aircraft was successfully towed from the runway at 2.12 pm.

“We apologise for any inconvenience caused and reiterate the safety of our crew and customers is our number one priority,” KQ added.

JKIA, which serves as the KQ hub, is one of the largest airports in the region and handles about 7.8 million passengers annually. The airport has, however,  depended on a single runway built over four decades ago. Efforts to expand the facility have often ended in controversies.

Why Kenya trimmed appetite for IMF debt,"Kenya has cut back on its planned borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by 7.2 percent to Sh465.4 billion ($3.6 billion) after partial repayment of the debut Eurobond that unnerved global investors.

This comes weeks after the country’s budget support from the World Bank was reduced in size by 20 percent to Sh155.2 billion ($1.2 billion).

The IMF has attributed this reduction in the size of the credit facility earmarked for Kenya to the February partial refinancing of the Sh258.7 billion ($2 billion) Eurobond due for maturity on June 24.

Kenya returned to the international markets in February, raising Sh193.9 billion ($1.5 billion) through a fresh Eurobond issuance whose maturity falls due in 2031. Proceeds from this Eurobond were used to partially buy back the Eurobond maturing in June. A buyback is a form of the process by which the repurchase of issued securities from holders or investors before the set maturity debt is done by the issuer.

The downward revision of the size of the IMF programme comes seven months after funds under the same programme had been increased in size by Sh121.3 billion ($938 million) to provide Kenya with access to cheap financing to retire the maturing Eurobond should the international markets have remained inaccessible as the June 2024 maturity approached.

“The mission continued virtually to finalise key technical aspects of the agreement including recalibrating access to IMF resources to align more closely with Kenya’s current needs following its access to the international bond markets earlier this year. If approved by the IMF’s Executive Board, the total remaining access will be adjusted to 135.55 percent of quota (SDR (Special Drawings Right) 735.77 million, about $976 million) which will also include a proposed recalibration of 21.67 percent of quota in access (SDR 117.6 million, about $156 million) toward the zero interest concessional resources under the ECF (Extended Credit Facility) arrangement,” the IMF says in its statement following the conclusion of the seventh review on June 11.

Read: IMF approves Sh109.8 billion new funding to Kenya

ECF provides medium-term financial assistance to low-income countries with protracted balance of payments problems. The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the IMF to supplement the official reserves of its member countries. The SDR is not a currency and can be used to boost a country’s liquidity.

The IMF programme size downgrade means the government now plans to tap into a loan that is Sh36.3 billion smaller than had been earlier anticipated under the ECF and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement that has been running since March 2021.

EFF provides financial assistance to countries facing serious medium-term balance of payments problems because of structural weaknesses that require time to address. To help countries implement medium-term structural reforms, the EFF offers longer program engagement and a longer repayment period.

The IMF programme size downgrade also means that Kenya’s access to the fund’s exceptional window granted at the end of 2023 has been reversed, implying the fund views the economy’s present position as having improved and in less need of emergency financing.

So far, Kenya has accessed Sh337.3 billion ($2.6 billion) courtesy of the program following six reviews of performance-based disbursements.

Africinvest completes purchase of I&M stake,"Private equity fund Africinvest has completed the purchase of a 10.13 percent stake or 167.53 million shares in listed lender I&M Group from UK development finance institution British International Investment (BII), the firms announced on Tuesday.

The deal was first disclosed in November 2023, and the transaction subsequently received regulatory approval from the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) in March 2024.

It is valued at Sh6.5 billion, representing a significant premium on the current Sh3.43 billion valuation of the stake at the bank’s prevailing share price at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE).

Read: Mauritian firm pays Sh6.5bn for I&M stake

At Sh6.5 billion, the deal would value the bank at Sh64.17 billion, compared to the present market capitalisation of Sh33.82 billion at the NSE.

BII purchased its stake in I&M in April 2016, when it was known as CDC Group, making it the fourth largest shareholder in the lender behind Minard Holdings Limited, Tacoma Limited, and Ziyungi Limited, whose stakes sit at 21.6 percent, 18.4 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively.



“Having been a trusted equity partner to I&M for over seven years, today’s announcement represents a great outcome to BII’s engagement, as we exit to a like-minded partner with a focus on commercial sustainability and development impact,” said BII investment director Maximilian Biswanger in a statement on Tuesday.

The inclusion of a valuation premium in private deals is commonly used as a means to entice the seller to offload their stake, with the valuation dependent on a mix of factors including the potential income after the acquisition, valuation of similar deals, and other benefits such as seats on the board for the buyer.

For Africinvest, which is purchasing the stake through its wholly-owned special purpose vehicle known as East Africa Growth Holding, the deal represents a deepening of its foothold in the I&M Group, having previously acquired a 24.76 percent share in I&M Bank Rwanda in 2019.

According to CAK disclosures when it approved the sale, the transaction will confer East Africa Growth Holding rights on the appointment of board directors, development of business plans, and making significant changes to the bank’s senior management—effectively giving the PE fund indirect joint control with existing shareholders.

I&M was listed in June 2013 following a reverse takeover of City Trust Limited by I&M Bank Limited. The group now operates in five countries – Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and Mauritius—through a mix of subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture investments.

In the year ending December 2023, the bank’s net profit grew by 12.7 percent to Sh12.62 billion and paid shareholders a dividend of Sh2.55 per share, or Sh4.22 billion in total.

"Queries as man, 33, disappears from Kisumu home","It was around 1pm on May 21, when Euphemia Atieno discovered that something was amiss.

For the first time in the family's history, Chrysantus Amimo had failed to show up for lunch.

Ms Atieno asked her daughter Bella Abungu if she had seen her brother. The answer was negative.

“My son never leaves home without informing us, and he never misses lunch if he is at home,” Ms Atieno would later explain to this writer.

Her husband, Lazarus Abungu, initially did not panic when his son failed to join the rest of the family members for lunch. He assumed that Amimo was just around and would soon return home.

However, he tensed when dinner time clocked and there was still no sign of the 33-year-old man.

“At first, I didn't see any cause for alarm, but when he failed to come for dinner, which was extremely unusual, a feeling of premonition gripped me,"" he says.

The couple immediately telephoned Amimo's siblings alerting them of the development.

""He might have left while I was working in the backyard because we had breakfast together and his sister said he was around until 11am,"" Ms Atieno explains amid sobs.

The following morning the family filed a missing person report at Nyangeta Police Post in Kibos and proceeded to print posters which they later circulated in the neighbourhood with the hope of gathering information that might lead to finding Amimo.

“We have been receiving distressing calls after posting about his disappearance on social media, with some callers demanding ransoms,” reveals Ms Atieno.

The couple says that they have received several anonymous calls from people claiming to have seen Amimo in various locations, including Ahero, Oyugis, and Homa Bay.

“One caller said he saw my son stranded in Ahero Town and was looking for bus fare to go to Nairobi.

""Another caller claimed to have seen him in Yala Town on the same day. I was disturbed because my son couldn't be in two places at once,” Mr Abungu said.

The family also received a lead that he was seen in Manyatta Estate in Kisumu, but by the time they arrived, they were told he had reportedly left two days earlier.

“Recently, I received a call at night from someone claiming to have seen my son in Sirare and demanded Sh15,000 to connect me with him,” Ms Atieno said.

Mr Abungu, says that life has never been the same ever since his son disappeared.

“We have searched nearly every area across Kisumu including police stations. The only places we have not checked are the hospitals.

""Since my son left, we have had sleepless nights. It hurts when you have lost someone, but it hurts the most not knowing their whereabouts,” said Mr Abungu.

Mr Amimo, who completed his studies at the Kisumu National Polytechnic in 2015, is said to have left home wearing blue jeans, a blue shirt, and sports shoes.

""He is a soft-spoken tall guy with a dark skin complexion and speaks English, Swahili and Dholuo. We pray that God keeps him safe wherever he is,"" says Mr Abungu.

Opera ordered to unblock betting firm Odibets on its website,"Multinational technology firm Opera Software Ireland Limited has been ordered to unblock a local betting firm and allow its gamblers to access the site.

The Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) made the ruling last week saying that the tech firm has financially hurt Odibets by denying punters access and redirecting them to the sites of rival betting firms.

The decision comes at a time when betting firms have been barred from displaying advertisements on the speed dial feature of Opera, without approval from the betting regulator.

Read: Browsers axe betting sites on speed dials in crackdown

“Opera Software Ireland Limited is directed to, with immediate effect, cease and desist from causing financial harm by blocking Odibets from accessing its browser and from further redirecting its customers to other betting sites,” CAK says in the notice issued on Wednesday last week.

The competition watchdog says that the directive will be in force until the completion of an ongoing probe between the betting firm and Opera.

Opera had an estimated 13.5 million users in Kenya as of the end of last year, who largely use feature phones.

Details of the matter being investigated have, however, not been disclosed at a time when betting firms have been put on the spot over their advertising overtures.

In January this year, the High Court directed the Betting and Licensing Control Board (BCLB) to ensure that betting firms do not use the speed dials feature to advertise online.

BCLB had last year warned the firms from using the speed dial feature saying that this advertises betting services without regard to the age and vulnerability of internet users.

Odibets, owned by Kareco Holdings Limited is one of the 128 betting firms angling for a share of the multibillion-shilling gambling industry in Kenya.

Kenya has one of the biggest betting industries on the continent, characterised by fierce competition among the companies.

Gamblers staked Sh620.97 billion in bets between 2018 and 2022, highlighting the craze that has made Kenya home to the highest percentage of young gamblers in Africa at 76 percent as of end of 2022.

The growth of betting has defied increased taxation on both punters and betting firms, with millions of unemployed Kenyans and the youth seeing gambling as a quick means of making cash, amid high rates of unemployment.

Row over MCAs allowances rocks Makueni County Assembly,"Tension rocked Makueni County Assembly for the second day on Tuesday after a faction of Wiper MCAs overturned the house majority leadership.

Assembly orderlies watched helplessly as what started as a disgruntlement over “unfair” distribution of allowances among MCAs degenerated into kicks and blows as the two factions tussled.

“You are not our majority leader,” an MCA shouted as she joined colleagues in attempting to kick out Tulimani MCA Kyalo Mumo, an ally of Makueni Governor Mutula Kilonzo Junior, who has been the Majority Leader since 2017.

In the changes in house majority leadership announced by a team of 13 Wiper MCAs on Monday, Kithungo/Kitundu MCA Kisungi Katete has replaced Mr Mumo as the Majority Leader while Nzaui/Kilili/Kalamba MCA Francis Mutuku has lost the deputy Majority Leader position to his Ilima counterpart Jonathan Muthoka.

Others affected in the shakeup are Magdalene Mulwa who was the Majority Whip, and Nguumo MCA Muthiani Mwangangi who was the Deputy Majority Whip.

Ms Mulwa has been replaced with Joyce Mwende while Kathonzweni MCA Benedict Maneno has replaced Mr Muthiani.

A faction led by Mr Mumo dismissed the changes in the assembly leadership.

“The purported changes in the house majority leadership are null and void. The members in that group did not follow house standing orders when electing themselves into office. The law requires aggrieved members to write to the house leadership in advance before conducting elections,” he told reporters.

Trouble started with a section of the MCAs decrying open discrimination in the distribution of allowances.

The outcry intensified recently after the assembly stripped some of the nominated MCAs of committee leadership positions.

“The meeting noted that the current leadership was treating Wiper members unfairly and was in favour of members from other political parties. Examples were cited on how three members namely Hon Sharon Mutinda, Hon Joyce Mwende, and Hon Elizabeth Muthike were stripped of committee leadership hence the responsibility allowances,” reads a section of the minutes of the Monday meeting seen by the Nation.

A section of the Wiper MCAs has since written to the Controller of Budget, the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission (EACC) and the Senate accusing Assembly Speaker Douglas Mbilu of discriminately dolling out allowances “which way above the ceilings are for allowances set by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.”

The team led by Mr Katete also sees the hand of President William Ruto in the cracks which have rocked the party.

The members of this faction accuse their colleagues of not being keen to promote Mr Musyoka as a potential presidential candidate in the county.

“The team led by Mr Mumo has not been keen with promoting the Wiper agenda at the house. Wiper members have only met thrice since August 2022. They have been holding meetings with United Democratic Alliance (UDA) agents,” Wiper-nominated MCA Urbanus Wambua said.

Mr Mumo’s faction dismissed the accusations as it denounced the new office-holders.

Attempts by Makueni Governor Mutula Kilonzo Junior to reconcile the aggrieved MCAs during a retreat in a Mombasa hotel over the weekend flopped.

Some of the MCAs walked out of a meeting chaired by Mr Kilonzo Jnr and Mr Mbilu in protest.

As this was happening, the nominated MCAs discretely stepped up efforts to enlist some of their elected colleagues into the plot to overturn the assembly majority leadership.

“The assembly majority leadership directed us to apologize to the governor and the speaker for reporting them to the Controller of Budget, the EACC and the Senate over illegal allowances. We promised them that we shall tender an apology letter on Monday. We have made ourselves very clear,” a Wiper nominated MCA privy of the political undercurrents told the Nation in confidence for fear of reprisal.

Malawi Vice President Saulos Chilima killed in plane crash,"Malawi's Vice President Saulos Klaus Chilima and nine others on board a military aircraft that went missing on Monday were killed in a plane crash, President Lazarus Chakwera said on Tuesday.

Chilima, 51, was aboard a military aircraft with nine others that left Lilongwe, the capital, on Monday at 9.17 am but was unable to land at Mzuzu airport as scheduled at 10.02 am due to poor visibility.

It was ordered to return to the capital but went off the radar and aviation authorities could not make contact with it.

“I’m deeply saddened, I’m sorry to inform you all that it has turn out to be a terrible tragedy. The search and rescue team has found the aircraft near a hill... they have found it completely destroyed with no survivors,” Chakwera, said.

Chakwera said in an address to the nation that the crash site was in a mountainous part of the Chikangawa Forest.

Chilima, seen as a potential candidate in next year’s presidential election, was arrested in 2022 over graft allegations.

How Safaricom overcharged Hustler loan borrowers,"Safaricom overcharged Hustler Fund borrowers to the tune of Sh368 million in the seven months to June 2023, contravening the law governing the Fund.

The Auditor-General in a report on operations of the Fund between November 2022 when it was established and June 2023, notes that despite there being legally set interest rates for Hustler Fund loans, Safaricom overcharged borrowers for penalties and rollover fees.

“...it was noted that Safaricom charged rollover fees at the rate 0.195 to 0.392 percent and a penalty fee at the rate of 0.13 to 4.95 percent to beneficiaries amounting to Sh368,760,229 contrary to the provisions of the law and regulations,” Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu notes.

The Financial Inclusion Fund (Hustler Fund) Regulations, 2022, caps interest or administrative fees borrowers can be charged at a maximum of eight percent and 9.5 percent if the borrower defaults.

“The interest or administrative fee payable by a beneficiary on a financial service or product advanced under these regulations shall be at a maximum rate of eight percent per annum on reducing balance: Provided that where a beneficiary defaults, the interest or administrative fee payable shall be nine and one half percent on a reducing balance,” the regulations state.

Contravention of the law attracts a Sh10 million fine or five-year jail term, or both.

“An applicant or an agent of the Fund who fails to give proper information or gives inaccurate or misleading information or falsifies information or misrepresents information required under these regulations to obtain a financial benefit, either for himself or herself or for another person, commits an offence and shall be liable to the penalty provided for under Section 199 of the Act,” the Financial Inclusion Fund Regulations, 2022, state.

Safaricom’s action has exposed weaknesses in the Fund management’s capacity to oversee compliance with the law when lending to Kenyans, while also exposing the company to scrutiny in its practices, and in its role of on-lending to millions of hustlers.

The audit also queries failure by the Fund management to provide proof of spending more than Sh450 million on the purchase of goods and payment of debts, lending millions of shillings to customers who had not opted into the Fund, holding customers lacking identity cards and extending additional loans before repayment of initial ones.

The government set up the Hustler Fund in November 2022 and injected Sh12 billion in seed capital, for lending to the unserved and underserved Kenyans.

But the Auditor-General notes that during the first seven months of the Fund’s operations, its management was already flouting lending principles and could have sunk more than Sh8 billion in loans that had been defaulted upon.

The audit also reveals that some 2,701 loans amounting to Sh2 million could not be traced despite being issued as they were not in the repayment or outstanding loan records.

IRA revokes closure of Directline Assurance,"The Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) has revoked the closure of Directline Assurance Company, hours after an announcement by media mogul SK Macharia through Royal Credit Limited, that the insurance firm had closed operations and fired all employees.

IRA Chief Executive Godfrey Kiptum on Tuesday rubbished the move, saying the insurer will continue to be operational.

“The purported actions are null and devoid of any legal effect and as such the insurer continues in full operation as licensed and approved by the Authority. The purported transfer of the assets of the insurer to any third party is therefore null and void ab initio (from the start),” Mr Kiptum said in a press statement to explain the status of the firm.

“All policies issued by Directline Assurance Company Limited remain in full force and effect and the insurer remains liable for any claims arising therefrom. All policyholders of the insurer may continue with their operations in accordance with their insurance contracts,” the IRA CEO added.

The regulator maintains that it has the sole authority to “approve, suspend or cancel” the operations of any insurance company in Kenya, terming Mr Macharia’s action as usurping of IRA duties.

Mr Macharia, the chairman of Royal Credit Limited - one of the shareholders of Directline, announced on Monday that the insurer had closed operations and laid off all its staff.

“The board of directors of Directline has been dissolved and all the assets taken over by Royal Credit Ltd. All employees have been dismissed, and Directline will no longer issue insurance services,” Mr Macharia said.

The communication caused panic, especially in public transport, as the firm has the largest share of the public service vehicles insurance business.

IRA now says it has placed the insurer under “heightened surveillance”.

“The Authority will take necessary steps as may be appropriate, pursuant to the provisions of the Insurance Act, Cap 487 Laws of Kenya, to ensure sustainability of the insurer and protection of insurance policyholders’ interests,” Mr Kiptum said.

How can South Africa form a unity government from wildly different visions?,"Talks to forge South Africa's post-election unity government will need to bring together parties with goals as contradictory as seizing white-owned farms and mines, ditching Black empowerment policies and tearing up the constitution.

How well the African National Congress (ANC) harmonises these divergent and mutually hostile visions will determine the government's stability, its ability to make decisions and its policy priorities over the next five years.

It will also test Nelson Mandela's 1994 aspiration for a ""rainbow nation at peace with itself"", as politicians try to navigate historical ethnic and racial enmities that were starkly exposed by the May 29 election.

""It's polarised politics on steroids,"" Piers Pigou, Southern Africa Programme Head at the Institute for Security Studies, said. ""It suggests we're going into a really messy, fluid period.""

The ANC - which ruled unopposed for 30 years before losing its majority for the first time with just 40% of last month's vote - is racing to agree with its rivals on a unity government to keep it in power.

It has until parliament's first sitting on Friday to do so, and with several options on how to structure it. President Cyril Ramaphosa last week said his party would prefer a government of national unity involving a large number of parties - rather than a formal coalition with one or two.

Yet in the two weeks since the poll, far from seeking common ground, parties have hardened positions and exchanged insults.

Last week ANC chair Gwede Mantashe attributed the success of ex-leader Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party - which came third - to ""Zulu tribalism"", prompting a backlash from Zulus and the MK who called his remark ""dangerous and offensive.""

Zuma has meanwhile claimed widespread fraud in an election observers and all the other parties deemed free and fair.

'Outright revolt'

Mandela was the last leader to set up a national unity government, in 1994. Unlike Ramaphosa, the former liberation hero didn't do this out of political necessity but to reassure a nation divided by apartheid that no group would ever again be marginalised.

Last month's election revealed a South Africa no less divided along ethnic and racial lines than three decades ago.

""Parties that did well in this election ... campaigned on very narrow nationalistic identity politics,"" said Oscar van Heerden, an ANC insider, author and a senior research fellow at the University of Johannesburg.

The poll set back progress towards ""a united, non-racial society"", he said.

Speaking to Reuters, MK spokesman Nhlamulo Ndlhela rejected that view, and chided Mantashe for a ""divisive"" remark.

Still, the MK swept up nearly half of the vote in Zuma's Zulu heartland of Kwazulu-Natal, while the Democratic Alliance is still overwhelmingly popular with whites, and remains the biggest opposition party with 22% of the vote.

The far left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) command their biggest support among urban Blacks, while the ANC has strong loyalty among rural Black voters. The Patriotic Alliance, with 2%, campaigned to defend coloured people, as mixed-race South Africans are called.

Investors see a simple alliance between the ANC and pro-business DA as the most market-friendly. Yet ANC officials told Reuters such an option had been rejected by ANC heavyweights, some of whom - such as executive committee member Mathews Phosa - see the DA as the party of white privilege and a long-term vote loser.

The ANC is instead trying to dilute the influence of the DA in any coalition by having smaller parties join in.

""If Ramaphosa just went into a coalition with the DA ... that would be suicide for the party's unity,"" said Nicole Beardsworth, University of Witwatersrand research fellow.

She said the ANC had always been a broad church, comprising neoliberals like Ramaphosa and a left wing, including the Communist Party and Congress of South African Trade Unions, both of whom have raised concerns about a deal with the DA.

""So they need to bring in ... smaller, more radical parties in order to balance the demands from the left of the ANC.""

But finding consensus that ends paralysis and creates a working government to kickstart South Africa's flagging economy is fraught with challenges.

""That's really where the rubber hits the road,"" said independent analyst Daniel Silke. ""It makes ... cohesive policy-making extremely difficult.""

The ANC and EFF for example, are committed to expropriating white-owned land for use by poor Black farmers, a policy the DA opposes. The DA wants to scrap Black empowerment policies that have mostly enriched a politically connected Black elite, a red line for the ANC.

Meanwhile the EFF and Zuma's MK party both want to overhaul the constitution, the former to put all land, water and mines to into state hands. The MK wants to replace it with one that would give more power to traditional chiefs.

Adding to the conundrum, the DA has ruled out working with either MK or EFF and Zuma's party says Ramaphosa must step down, a condition he has firmly rejected.

"Kenya will not meet revenue goals on high taxes, don says","A university don wants MPs to repeal all tax increases contained in the Finance Act, 2023 and those proposed in the Finance Bill, 2024 because of their negative effect.

Professor Njoroge Gitonga, an entrepreneur and former lecturer of Economics at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology told MPs to delete all clauses in the Finance Bill, 2024 and repeal the Finance Act of 2023 to reverse the negative tax increases.

Appearing before the National Assembly’s Finance and National Planning Committee, Prof Gitonga said the notion that tax increases can boost tax revenue collection is false from an economic point of view and that the inverse is true.

He said the Finance Bill, 2024 proposes to further move Kenya from a low-tax environment to a high-tax one.

He said if the tax measures in the Finance Act, 2023 and Finance Bill, 2024 are scrapped, Kenya would go back to a low tax rate environment initiated by former President Mwai Kibaki and continued by his successor, Uhuru Kenyatta.

“Based on facts outlined, it is the reasoned recommendation to the committee and the government to repeal all tax increases contained in the Finance Act, 2023 and the deletion of all tax increase proposals in the Finance Bill, 2024,” Prof Gitonga said.

Revenue tax collections

“Only this way can the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) go back to a tax growth trajectory experienced prior to the enactment of the Finance Act, 2023.”

He said the KRA revenue performance reports from 2021 to 2024 show that out of the total revenue of Sh362 billion, Sh135 billion are the increases or decreases in new revenue tax collections from the previous financial year whereas Sh50 billion is projected to increase in the current financial year 2023/24.

“For example, Sh362 billion is the difference between the KRA collection of Sh2.199 trillion in the financial year 2021/22 and Sh1.699 trillion collected in the financial year 2020/21.

“We can all agree that between the financial years 2021 to 2024, the Executive and legislative action has resulted in significant increases in various tax rates in the Kenyan economy. The result is declining new tax revenue,” Prof Gitonga said.

He said tax rate increases do not result in tax revenue collection increases because individuals and firms will engage in skilful tax evasion, which is illegal.

Prof Gitonga said an increased tax environment will see individuals and firms adjust their consumption behaviour.

“Tax rate increases result in a negative decrease in income to both individuals and firms. This means they had less disposable income and they consume less goods and services,” he said.

“This means the gross domestic product (GDP) decreases which results in the government collecting less tax collections as evidenced in the current macroeconomic reality in Kenya.”

He said the KRA data shows that the tax increases contained in the Finance Act, 2023 have failed in increasing tax revenue collections.

Increase tax rates

Prof Gitonga told the committee chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani that as soon as the government began to increase tax rates after the last presidential election.

“In the financial year 2021/22, tax revenues stood at Sh1.031 trillion. In the first nine months of the current financial year, KRA collected Sh1.5 trillion. Should the government enact the tax increase proposals contained in the Finance Bill, 2024, the tax revenue collection will only be worse,” Prof Gitonga said.

He said KRA data shows that the taxman collected Sh2.031 trillion in the financial year 2021/22 which dropped to Sh1.669 trillion in the financial year 2021/22.

He said the difference is a new tax revenue of Sh362 billion. “This shows a serious financial loss the government suffered as a result of the tax hikes enacted in the Finance Act, 2023. Do note that the base increase value of Sh362 billion is held constant and therefore a minimum figure that would increase given annual economic growth rate increases,” Prof Gitonga said.

Prof Gitonga told lawmakers that the financial debt distress the government suffered and continues to suffer has arisen due to tax rate hikes contained in the Finance Act, 2023 which has resulted in KRA raising less tax revenues.

Cafe that serves professionals by day and revellers by night,"In the bustle of Nairobi’s Westlands, Kosta Café founder Helen Ogweno, has created a thriving food business that caters to a unique clientele.

Nestled inside Cavalli @ the Manor, a popular entertainment joint, Kosta Café has become a favourite food joint among corporate professionals during the day and revelers by night.

“The location was good,” Helen notes. “Westlands is a place where you find corporate professionals during the day and a lively crowds in the evenings. It’s the perfect spot for a cafe like ours that serves both lunch buffets and late-night à la carte meals.”

There is a growing trend in the hospitality industry whereby cafés are strategically placed adjacent to clubs and nightlife spots. This symbiotic arrangement draws in a diverse clientele who seek both entertainment and quality food.

Helen acknowledges this stating: “It is an emerging trend because it creates a seamless flow of customers who move between the club and the cafe. People who come to enjoy the club often need a place to relax, have a meal, or grab a drink, and having a cafe right next door meets that demand perfectly.” This strategic positioning not only boosts foot traffic but also enhances the overall customer experience, making it a win-win for both the club and the cafe.

Customer-focused.

Helen’s approach to Kosta Cafe’s operations is meticulous and customer-focused.

The cafe serves a buffet of between 30 to 50 people until 4pm from Monday to Friday, followed by an à la carte service. This flexible dining option caters to both individuals and groups, accommodating various customer preferences.

“We serve lunch with a mini buffet for people who are walking around,” the proprietor explains. “After 4pm, we switch to à la carte, preparing what customers have requested as per their needs.”

A key strategy for Kosta Café has been its diverse and adaptable menu. The café offers a range of dishes from fast food to traditional meals, including chicken, beef, goat, pork and fish prepared in different styles. Helen’s keen observation of customer preferences led to a significant reduction in the use of spices and cooking oil, catering to a growing demand for healthier options.

“We realised that nowadays, people don’t like spices and lots of oil due to lifestyle diseases,” she said. “So in our cooking, we make it as mild as possible, but very tasty.”

Kosta Café employs a mix of regular and casual staff to handle the varying customer flow. Regular staff manage the day-to-day operations, while casual workers are brought in during peak times, such as Thursday evenings and weekends when the club’s activities heighten.

“We have five regular staff and an additional seven casual staff who come on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday,” Helen notes. “This helps us handle the large population we get on these days.”

With a year and few months in food business, and more than a decade in supplies business, having retired from her insurance job back in 2013, Hellen emphasises financial discipline as a cornerstone of her business acumen. She used her savings from previous ventures to set up the necessary infrastructure for Kosta Café, including freezers, cookers and utensils. “You need a number of things to start a food business in this capacity,” she explains. “For this establishment, I spent like Sh2 million to stock, buy all the requirements, and get the necessary licenses.”

As a food services provider in the micro, small and medium enterprises sector, Kosta café is not averse to challenges. The high cost of rent in Westlands and the fluctuating food prices with the tough economy are some of them.

“The high cost of living is a big challenge,” admits Ms Ogweno. “We navigate these challenges by maintaining strict cost controls and adjusting prices gradually to avoid significant impacts on customers.”

The café, which is keen on growth, capitalises on innovation by continuously updating their menu based on customer feedback and market trends. Recently, they introduced new drink offerings, such as mocktails, and are planning further menu enhancements.

Additionally, the founder is exploring opportunities for expansion, with plans to open a second branch in a carefully chosen location to maintain the brand’s momentum. “In the next few months, we may have another branch,” she reveals.

Lower sales

Mr Japh Adams Kiaye, the manager at Kosta Café shares that upon assuming the role, he encountered challenges such as lower sales and profitability, but through implementing strategic changes, they have managed to overcome these obstacles and thrive despite tough economic conditions.

Technology plays a pivotal role in enhancing the customer experience at Kosta Café and streamlining operations. Leveraging technology, the café has optimised staffing and improved efficiency in various areas.

“We’ve partnered with Family Bank, utilising their merchant portal to manage mobile money and PDQ transactions seamlessly. Integration with our POS system enables automatic reconciliation, eliminating the need for manual intervention. Moreover, we have noticed the impact of adopting technology, as it has made payments easier, fostering customer trust,” the manager shares.



“Additionally, we’ve implemented a loyalty programme for buffet customers, awarding them loyalty points that can be redeemed for food, further enhancing customer satisfaction and retention. Furthermore, we have adopted Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and utilise bulk SMS to stay engaged with our customers, ensuring personalised communication and fostering long-term relationships,” he added.

Kosta Café has innovatively expanded its services by offering convenient food delivery packages to companies during lunchtime. Understanding the busy schedules of corporate professionals, the café provides a variety of freshly prepared meals that can be delivered directly to offices, ensuring that employees enjoy a nutritious and delicious lunch without leaving their workplace.

These tailored packages cater to diverse tastes and dietary preferences, ranging from traditional delicacies to light and healthy options.

This service not only enhances employee satisfaction and productivity but also strengthens Kosta Café’s presence in the corporate sector, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable and customer-focused restaurant.

Anxiety as Mai Mahiu flood victims moved from camp,"The resettlement of the Mai Mahiu flood victims has been marred by uncertainty as displaced families were moved from the camps they have been living into rented houses last weekend.

The government had promised to set aside Sh300 million to build houses for survivors of the tragedy that claimed 62 lives.

But following reports that the State is yet to secure land where the displaced people will be resettled, the families fear that the process might take longer than expected and the government may not meet its obligations.

However, Nakuru County Commissioner Lyford Kibaara on Monday, June 10 assured the affected families that the government is working to resettle them after recording their details.

“We have a list of the affected people from the time they were initially housed at Ngeya Girls Secondary School before being moved to rental houses and others to a prayer centre. We have since moved families from the centre to rental houses. We have their records. Any person who feels left out should come forward and make a complaint,” Mr Kibaara told the Nation.

Flood victims

On Sunday, President William Ruto, who presided over the Akorino National Prayer Service in Nakuru, reiterated that all the Mai Mahiu flash flood victims will be resettled.

He said that after consultations, the government resolved to buy land and build houses for the families.

“I am saying it myself so that it is known that this is the position of the government. For now, we are searching for land to resettle the victims. I believe before the end of this month, the land will have been found,” he said.

This comes amid concerns by the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) over the planned resettlement.

The commission’s Deputy Executive Director Cornelius Oduor said that despite the State promising the survivors new homes, there is no clear framework for their resettlement.

The KHRC has accused the government of forcing families out of the camp and offering them three months' rent despite some of them rejecting the move.



Mr Oduor said that some families have been forced to return to their houses which were partially destroyed during the floods while others have moved into rental houses with the government paying for them rent for three months.

The official said that when such calamities happen, the government should guarantee the safety of its people.

“We are here to follow up on the government’s commitment. When the tragedy occurred, it shocked everybody and top government officials visited the area. We remember very well the commitment given by the Deputy President that the government will stand with these people to ensure that they get back to their normal lives,” he said.

Speaking in Mai Mahiu, Mr Oduor noted that there is a lot of uncertainty and lack of clarity for the victims because once they leave the camp there is no clear plan on what will happen next.

Mr Oduor said there are claims that the list of the victims had been tampered with by some local administrators and genuine families have been left out.

He said that the commission has received complaints over lack of accountability and discrimination among the victims.

Mr Oduor said some people were asked to leave the camp and yet they were not given money to rebuild their lives.

He said the commission has filed a case in court seeking compensation for the families.

“Beyond the payment of rent, these people engaged in various economic activities but now they do not have a source of income. They are now left in rental facilities to eat whatever little was left after leaving the camp. Families are now facing an uncertain future,” he said.

“We are following up to see that justice is served,” he added.

Ms Eunice Wanjiru, a victim whose home was partially destroyed, said that their family was missing from the list of beneficiaries despite losing property.

Her mother was traumatised by the incident and she was forced to relocate from Mai Mahiu to Nyandarua County.

Another victim, Mr Samson Njamba, said he has rented a one-bedroom where he lives with his wife and sons aged 17 and 12.

Residents of Kamushire said the flash floods destroyed their crops. They appealed to the government to fulfil its promise of resettling them.

It’s about getting the job done well: Why Dr Githinji left the stage at UN Assembly,"At this year's UN World Health Assembly, Githinji Gitahi, global CEO of Amref Health Africa, explained his abrupt departure from the stage during last year's summit.

He found himself on an all-male panel discussing an issue that disproportionately harms women, which he described as an awkward situation. Gitahi made a statement by vacating his chair, inviting any qualified woman to take his place before walking off.

“It’s not just about fairness; it’s about getting the job done well. A woman is the best public health officer I’ve ever met. My mother had nine children, no education, married at 17, and gave birth in 1952 during the war, with no medical help. She alone ensured our survival,” he explained.

“With women-led and women-responsive policies, we see less child and maternal mortality, less malaria, less malnutrition. Fewer people die.”

The phenomenon of all-male panels, or ""manels"", is common not only in global forums like the UN World Health Assembly but also locally.

Recently, Kenyan discussions on the Finance Bill 2024, have prominently featured male experts, despite the presence of numerous female financial and legal experts.

Read also: Qualified women abound, so why is your expert panel all men?

On May 14, a mainstream news broadcaster hosted a discussion on the Finance Bill's first reading with four male panellists moderated by a male news anchor. The same outlet later discussed the bill's implications on the manufacturing industry, again with only male panellists.

This trend is often seen in panels addressing national issues and in fields where women are underrepresented.

A study conducted by Aga Khan Graduate School of Media and Communications titled ""The State of Women in the Media: Representation, Coverage and Framing of Women in East African Media"" sought to establish the main actors in news articles featuring women and their roles. The main actor is the person mentioned or referenced most in the news articles, such as an expert.

It was found that more than half (54 per cent) of all the analysed articles from the six newspapers in the three countries (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania) had women acting in non-traditional roles as experts and treated as experts first and not women experts as the main actors. However, 13 per cent of newspapers in East Africa still portrayed women in traditional roles such as homemaker.

The report also noted that the projection of women as experts in non-traditional roles helps media consumers perceive women in a fashion that normalizes women’s roles in these non-traditional roles.

In a Daily Nation editorial, Gender Editor Dorcas Muga noted that when she reached out to sources for a national story, most women were hesitant to be featured.

Janet Mbugua, an experienced panellist and moderator, explains this reluctance:

""Many times, women panellists face rude interruptions and have fellow panellists try to shut them down. This affront to the agency of women includes online violence, stalking, harassment, and dismissing their opinions as inferior,"" she tells nation.africa, adding that such bullying often continues online after the event.

Jane Godia, Director of Africa Women in News (WIN), highlights that the notice given to women for panel participation is often too short, making it seem like an afterthought.

“Late-night or early-morning panels also pose safety concerns and fail to consider the roles women play in society and within their families. Most significant interviews are scheduled at times that are not women-friendly,” she says.

To ensure equal representation, Janet advises that moderators, event planners, and curators need to be intentional in balancing participants.

“Without this effort, we risk hearing biased opinions. Additionally, it is crucial to protect panellists online after the sessions, as this is when they can face significant challenges,” she says.

Jane Godia recommends approaching women without intimidation, giving enough notice for preparation, and considering recorded or hybrid interviews to accommodate women's schedules. She adds that it is important to recognise that women's expertise can address national issues, not just women's issues.

Africa CDC chief tells Africans to 'respect partnerships' over decision to launch continent's vaccine manufacturing initiative in Paris,"The Director General of Africa Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), Dr Jean Kaseya has asked the continent to be ‘respectful of partnerships’ after an upsetting decision to launch the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA)in Paris, France was made by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

The launch is scheduled for June 20, 2024 after last week, Gavi’s board approved a new five-year strategy (2026-2030), focusing on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing.

The director general who attended the board meeting last week underscored the importance of ‘respectful partnership’ and collaboration, stating, “local manufacturing is the second independence of Africa because it impacts our health security and economic growth.

However, in the same week, Amref Health Africa Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) faulted Africa CDC and Gavi highlighting for the decision while highlighting that that it doesn’t make sense and beats logic for AVMA to be launched somewhere that is not on ‘African soil’.

“We have to realize that communities are where the power is based, that shift needs us to shift our mindsets to say that for us to actually make that shift, we have to give up our power and that is the difficulty of localization,” he told Nation in an interview.

“Gavi has made an extremely important decision to launch and to invest in AVMA, the fact that it is being launched in Paris tells you that France doesn’t want to give up power.”

Dr Githinji wonders why France, which is a great funder of Gavi, sees it fit to launch something that is meant for Africa in Paris.

He insists that the best way to serve communities is by handing over that power to the communities.

“Gavi is unable to do that because of barriers and those barriers have to do with money (who is going to control our money?).

Secondly, it is our belief of what knowledge matters because we think we have formed in our minds what structure of knowledge matters, “he told Nation.

“Unless it's published in The Lancet or BMJ which the communities do not know despite having knowledge, it doesn’t matter, “the GCEO highlighted, urging Gavi, Africa CDC and partners to respect systems that African communities have then find a way of using these systems.

“Africa is striving to enhance its vaccine manufacturing capabilities, and hosting the launch on African soil would be a powerful symbol of the continent's ownership and leadership in the initiative.

It would promote localization and underscore its commitment and proactive stance, resonating globally and sending a clear message that Africa is not merely a beneficiary but a leader in its health future,"" Dr Githinji told delegates during the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva last week.

He  however acknowledges the vital role Gavi plays on the continent despite faulting its board on the launch and reminds that from 2000 to 2022, Gavi invested US$11.9 billion to enhance access to life-saving vaccines in Africa, resulting in 11.1 million future deaths averted in Africa.

The GCEO is further of the view that the launch would be an excellent opportunity to further mobilize African nations to support the Africa Medicines Agency (AMA), which plays a pivotal role in creating an enabling environment for vaccine manufacturing by providing regulatory oversight, facilitating capacity building, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders.

According to Amref, Africa’s vaccine manufacturing capability is rapidly advancing, marked by significant milestones and robust initiatives.

“South Africa's Biovac Institute partners with global pharmaceutical companies to produce and distribute vaccines, while the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, is renowned for its yellow fever vaccine production. Egypt's Vacsera is also expanding its facilities to increase vaccine production capacity,” Dr Githinji pointed out noting that these local initiatives exemplify Africa's commitment to build a resilient, self-sufficient vaccine supply chain, ensuring better health outcomes and fostering economic growth across the continent.

He maintains that an African venue for the launch would provide an ideal platform to showcase these existing hubs and potential local manufacturing capacities, building confidence among international partners and investors in Africa’s ability to scale up vaccine production.

However, in an official response to queries fielded by Nation on Monday, Africa CDC said that they had consulted Gavi, their partners whose decision to launch AVMA in Paris they fully support and have decided to have another launch on ‘African Soil’ after the ‘Paris launch’.

“The AVMA launch is happening in Paris on 20th June with a subsequent one in Africa in the weeks following that launch. More details will be communicated,” a senior official at Africa CDC explained.

“In recognition of AVMA’s significance to Africa, Dr  Kaseya announced that the popular launch of AVMA will occur on African soil in the coming weeks. This momentous occasion will bring together African leaders, Gavi, donors and partners, African Civil Society Organizations, and communities to reflect on and celebrate the journey toward Africa’s self-reliance in manufacturing vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

Together, we stand on the brink of a new era for Africa’s self-reliance in health security, driven by innovation, partnership, and a shared vision for a safer, healthier, and more prosperous Africa,” Africa CDC said in an official response.

But why is the Africa CDC not contesting the decision to launch AVMA on foreign soil?

France, a G7 member state, has been a donor to Gavi since 2004 and has contributed to the Vaccine Alliance through direct contributions and the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm).

According to Gavi, in 2006, France made a first commitment to IFFIm of €373 million over the period 2007–2021.

An additional IFFIm pledge was made in 2007, of €867 million over 2008–2026, bringing France’s total IFFIm commitment to €1.23 billion.

France also made direct contributions to Gavi, from 2004 to 2010, it provided €15 million of direct funding.

In June 2011, France made an additional direct commitment of €100 million over the period 2011–2015. In January 2015 at Gavi’s second replenishment conference in Berlin, the Minister of State for Development and Francophonie announced an additional IFFIm contribution of €150 million and the launch of a €100 million pilot initiative in support of the Sahel region.

During the Global Vaccine Summit in June 2020, France announced €350 million in new contributions: €250 million was allocated to Gavi’s core programmes for 2021–2025, and €100 million was allocated to the Gavi COVAX AMC (a part of the vaccine pillar of the ACT-A initiative launched by France in May 2020 to coordinate the response to COVID-19) to ensure the equitable distribution of a future vaccine against COVID-19 once such a vaccine became available.

In 2021 and in 2022, France pledged an additional €100 million per year, bringing France’s total contribution to COVAX to €300 million.

This is why Dr Kaseya has maintained that AFRICA CDC fully supports the decision made by Gavi’s board to launch AVMA in Paris.

EACC wary lawmakers may weaken war on corruption,"The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has accused lawmakers of plotting to water down the war on graft through the proposed amendments to the Conflict of Interest Bill.

EACC Chief Executive Officer Twalib Mbarak said on Monday, June 10, the suggested changes by the Senate were illegal and asked the National Assembly to reject them.

The Conflict of Interest Bill was introduced last year and aims to stop public officers from having one leg in public service and another in private practice.

“The commission has noted with concern the proposals made by the Senate to review and amend the Conflict of Interest Bill, 2023, being the National Assembly Bills number 12 of 2023. The Senate passed the Bill on May 16, 2024 with proposals of substantial amendments,” Mr Mbarak said in a letter to the Clerk of the National Assembly, Samuel Njoroge.

The Nation has learnt that the EACC chairman Bishop David Oginde and Mr Mbarak met with National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula as part of the push to rally the House to block the Senate’s proposals.

Negative impact

Mr Mbarak said that some of the proposals being fronted by the Senate, after being tabled by Bomet Senator Henry Sigei, will have a negative impact in the fight against corruption.

Some of the issues that Mr Mbarak said needed to be rectified are; removal of EACC from administration of the Act, deletion or provisions on Conflict of Interest in other legislations and removal of the proposed compliance measures in management of conflict of interest.

Others are; EACC staff from the rank of Deputy Director and above shall be subject to the Powers and Privileges Committee of the National Assembly and address access to the Declaration of Income, Assets and Liabilities by retaining section 31 of the bill.

Mr Mbarak said that the commission was ready to engage further to provide any clarifications or additional information as may be required.

The original Bill was approved by the Cabinet early last year and forwarded to the National Assembly for enactment into law, as part of the conditions imposed on Kenya by development partners such as the International Monetary Fund.

Embezzlement of public funds

The Bill has helped tame rampant embezzlement of public funds by State officials who used to trade with the government directly or through proxies who include relatives and associates.

If the changes are made, that means that, henceforth, there will be no punishment for State officials doing business with the government or giving tenders to relatives.

Currently, the Bill, as mutilated by the Senate, is back at the National Assembly for concurrence and transmission to the President for assent.

Transparency International-Kenya has also waded into the matter and expressed disappointment with the Senate’s decision to mutilate the Bill through amendments.

“By removing the sanction that defines conflict of interest and stripping the EACC of its implementing authority, the Senate has severely weakened the Conflict of Interest Bill, compromising the fight against corruption and effectively legislating State officials’ ability to engage in self-serving business practices without fear of punishment,” the lobby group said in a statement.

Shady payments cost nine Rift Valley counties Sh1bn,"Nine Rift Valley counties may have lost nearly Sh1 billion in irregular payments for work not done and services not rendered.

This was revealed by Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu in her report for the 2022-2023 financial year, which noted that most of the counties could not provide documents to support dubious expenditures running into millions of shillings.

In Kericho County, payments worth Sh29 million were made to 15 contractors without documents proving that they had supplied any goods or offered any services to the devolved unit.

The county government also paid Sh169 million for domestic travel and allowances for 47 officers but a review of the Ifmis payment details and bank statements revealed that the employees were paid in excess of the number of days that may reasonably be available in a year.

While Turkana County paid Sh18 million to building contractors, the amount was not supported by invoices, delivery notes, purchase orders, contracts, inspection and acceptance reports and completion certificates.

Supply of furniture

In West Pokot, Governor Simon Kachapin paid Sh5,898,204 for the supply of furniture for 3,934 Early Childhood Development and Education (ECDE) centres.

However, market surveys done by the procurement unit indicated the price per chair as Sh900, but the actual average procurement price for the supplies was Sh1,499 per chair, leading to an excess payment of Sh599 per chair and a possible loss of Sh2,356,466 in public funds.

The county government also procured a rig and truck at Sh41,884,000 but did not provide the original logbook for the truck as evidence of ownership. A post-delivery inspection report from the public works department to confirm the suitability of the machinery was not provided.

In Samburu County, Governor Lati Leleit paid Sh36,441,690 to casual workers in the department of health. However, there was no formal engagement of the casuals nor approval by the County Public Service Board.

In Trans Nzoia, Governor George Natembeya has been faulted for paying casual labourers Sh95 million in wages for more than twelve months. It had hired 682 casual labourers for more than the prescribed period of three months.

In Uasin Gishu County, Governor Jonathan Bii irregularly hired a private legal consultant at Sh6 million. However, there were no procurement records confirming that the legal services were competitively sourced.

Sh200 million

Baringo County is also on the spot for spending more than Sh200 million on fuel, oil and lubricants, but could not provide supporting documents such as fuel registers, work tickets, detailed orders, and statements of consumption from the contracted suppliers.

Laikipia County under Governor Joshua Irungu irregularly paid Sh801,720 to MCAs and assembly staff for domestic travel.

However, these payments which should have been paid by the county assembly, were wrongly charged to the executive.

In Nakuru County, Governor Susan Kihika's administration irregularly paid 15 million to MCAs for domestic travel, despite the assembly having an independent vote. The county is also on the spot over the irregular payment of Sh116 million in legal fees.

In Narok, the county used Sh59 million to buy motor vehicles and other equipment but the delivery notes, pre-inspection reports and evidence that the vehicles were received were not provided for audit. Further, the post-delivery inspection conducted and a report from mechanical engineer from the Department of Roads.

Kajiado County made irregular payments of Sh43 million to temporary employees whose schedules were not provided for audit.

In Bomet, Governor Hillary Barchok irregularly paid lawyers Sh22 million in legal fees without payment vouchers, demand notes or court proceeding statements. The devolved unit also made unsupported payments of Sh19 million for the routine maintenance of vehicles and other transport equipment.

Babies gone too soon: When joy turned into tears,"The pain of losing a child in the very place where life is supposed to begin is a heart-wrenching experience. Many mothers carry within them the weight of emptiness and shattered dreams while navigating grief that few can comprehend.

While Kenya’s neonatal mortality rate stands at 22 deaths per 1,000 live births — 21 deaths per 1,000 live births in rural areas and 26 deaths per 1,000 live births in urban areas — it is far below the United Nations’ target of 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, according to data from the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef).

However, the country has been showing great improvement, placing Kenya among the top performers in Africa. The statistics have dropped from 1,007 per 100,000 live births in 2001 and 250 in 2020. Then, childbirth was a dangerous journey for many women in Kenya.

Unicef cited birth asphyxia and trauma (32 per cent), prematurity (25 per cent), and sepsis (16 per cent) as the leading causes of neonatal death in the country.

The data also indicated that newborns born to mothers with higher education are less likely to die during the first month compared to those born to mothers with no education.

The risk of infant mortality also results from neglect, insufficient staffing and inadequate infrastructure.

The Healthy Nation team spoke to eight women who after the loss of their babies have found themselves grappling with emptiness and purposelessness in life as they call it.

A majority of them have been unable to sleep, lost appetite and have had consistent headaches.

Here are their stories:

Beatrice Anyango

June 16, 2023 will always ring a bell in her mind. She walked into Sabako Health Center looking forward to welcoming her sixth child. After a couple of tests, the doctor in charge said she was not yet due and released her to go back home. She left as instructed. A few hours later, she showed back at the facility in the company of her husband after persistent abdominal pains.

“I stayed in the waiting line for an hour with no one attending to me. I was then moved to the maternity wing after a medical examination. The doctor who was attending to me changed shifts and left me under the care of another doctor who came in the ward hours later,” she says.

The doctor, she says, did not bother to check on her until she started bleeding but when she raised an alarm, the doctor indicated that she was too old to complain about labour pains and ordered her to stop making noise.

“I felt a sharp pain and screamed. The doctor came and found I was already pushing the baby. I was prepared for the worst. The baby came but instead of crying, he was breathing with difficulty as if his chest was congested,” says the 32-year-old woman.

The doctor would then place the newborn on her chest while warning her to hold him or let him fall on the ground. He later picked up the newborn and placed him on a weighing scale while trying to resuscitate him, but his breathing did not change.

A couple of minutes later, the doctor announced that the baby had died.

“I believe the health facility owes me an apology due to how I was treated. Everything was off from the word go, it felt as if I was a burden,” says Beatrice, adding that she can never wish what she went through even to the worst enemy.

Tony Okeyo

When Tony Okeyo’s wife announced that she was experiencing labour pains on November 17, 2022, the first-time father could not hide his joy.

He quickly made arrangements and moved his wife to Star Hospital, which was the closest. On arrival, he was informed that her blood pressure was high and she had to be referred to another hospital.

They quickly took a motorcycle to Kisumu County Referral Hospital. They were again referred to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital.

On arrival, which was minutes after midnight, she was wheeled into the labour ward. She was bleeding.

She gave birth the next day at 1:30pm. The baby’s temperature was very high, according to the doctor’s records. Even with the concerns, they were discharged and told that breastfeeding the baby would stabilise her temperature.  “While speaking to one of the nurses during discharge, a student doctor approached us and offered to conduct a home visit to check on our baby,” says Tony, adding that the trainee had informed them that she was working on a project on maternal child health.

Back home, his wife kept breastfeeding the baby, but she died the following day in the afternoon.

Tony says a doctor friend told them that the baby had an infection, which was not detected at the health facility.

“I blame the health facility for all that happened. They were in a capacity to diagnose and treat whatever condition my baby had, but all they did was to discharge us with the hope that everything would get back to normal,” wept Tony.

Monica Awino

Monica Odhiambo lost her nine-month-old baby in 2023 after a battle with an unknown medical condition. She diligently attended all her antenatal care visits.

She went into labour on January 3, 2023, two months after her due date of November 10, 2022, making her pregnancy last 11 months. She gave birth through a cesarean section to save the life of the baby whom the doctors said was stressed.

“When my baby was born, he didn’t make any sound and was immediately moved to the nursery. I got to see him after two days,” she said.

The two-day-old baby could not breastfeed and I had to express milk, which would then be given to the baby using tubes,” she says.

The baby stayed in the nursery for three weeks before they were discharged in late January.

Even after discharge, the baby remained sickly and would be in and out of the hospital with weekly checkups as was the norm for every other child who had been through the nursery unit.

“My baby was always crying. I also noticed he had delayed milestones and could not sit up at the age of eight months. Whenever we went to hospital, my baby would be diagnosed with malaria while on other occasions, the health workers never explained what was ailing the child.”

They had instead advised that the baby should be taken for occupational therapy before he died later the same year at nine months old.

“What pains me to date is the fact that I buried my child without knowing what ailed him. Sometimes I want to believe overstaying in my womb could have been the reason behind her medical challenges but why was I never told?”

Victoria Amisi

Victoria Amisi’s baby succumbed two days after delivery to unknown complications after recording extremely high temperatures.

The doctors, she said, never explained what led to the death of her baby.

“A nurse who attended to me said my baby died because she could not breastfeed while in another clinic. I was told my baby died due to an infection, which had resulted in the high temperatures,” says Victoria.

To date, the 26-year-old mother of one still remembers the happenings of March 20, 2021, as if it happened yesterday.

She checked into Emusire Sub-county Hospital ready to welcome her bundle of joy. On arrival, she was directed to the maternity ward, where a further medical examination confirmed she was only four centimetres dilated.

She was instructed to walk along the hospital hallway and was ushered into the delivery room seven hours later.

The first-time mother says on that day, there was only one nurse on duty attending to two women at once. “It happened that we were both ready to push at the same time, forcing the nurse to attend to us in turns after every second,” says Victoria.

Luckily, she gave birth to a baby girl who weighed 3.5 kilogrammes. The baby went through a couple of medical examinations before being discharged.

The following day, the doctor administered the baby’s first immunisation and they were later discharged. “When we got home, the baby’s temperatures shot up, leaving us worried. They tried to cool the baby’s body temperatures down using a warm towel but all was in vain.

“We took the baby back to the hospital. The facility told us the laboratory had been closed for the day. We were then advised to buy a painkiller to lower the baby’s temperature.”  They bought and made their way back home.

But his condition worsened. They went to two public health facilities and were informed that the laboratories were not operational at night. They waited till morning, with the baby surviving on painkillers.

The following morning, the baby died a few minutes after she was placed on oxygen.

Maureen Khasandi

Maureen lost her baby minutes after delivery.  She arrived at Kakamega County General Teaching and Referral Hospital at 6am while experiencing labour pains only to be attended to at 7am.

A nurse then approached her with admission forms, which she filled out before being allowed into the labour room.

She was then given an injection without explaining why it was necessary.

She was then informed that the doctor would be around once she was ready to push.

The doctor was nowhere to be found. When she was ready, she pushed the baby.

Before they knew it, she had given birth.

The baby was then moved to the nursery. It was nose bleeding.

A couple of minutes later, the baby died.

On further interrogation, Maureen was told by one of the nurses that the baby had died due to an injection she had been given while at the maternity ward moments before delivery.

“I believe that delivery should be treated as an emergency, a mother should be treated in a friendly manner to ensure both her and the baby make it alive. I lost my baby because I was left alone,” she wept.

Linda Oyella

When she started having labour pains on December 25, 2023, she hurriedly prepared and left her home in Emabwi for Ipali health centre within Vihiga County.

She opted to travel on a motorcycle because it had rained and it would take time for a vehicle to manoeuvre the terrain. The 26-year-old says upon arrival at the health facility, she was first asked to buy scissors and cotton wool before she could be admitted to the maternity section.

“I was in so much pain and asked if the health worker could attend to me and  then I would pay for the materials once I delivered, but the staff could hear none of it,” says Linda.

Her mother-in-law rushed and purchased the commodities while she stayed behind in the waiting area.

When she arrived, Linda was allowed into the maternity section, but there was yet another challenge.

“We only had one health worker attending to me and two other women at the maternity ward. My mother-in-law called on the health worker to help me when she heard me scream but it was too late. The baby was out,” says Linda.

“My baby did not make any sound and as the health worker tried to resuscitate him, this did not work. The baby needed oxygen but the oxygen supply at the facility had run out. The administration made an appeal for supplies but within a few minutes, my baby was gone,” cries Linda.

They would later be informed that the baby had died due to stress as a result of delayed delivery.

“Just like that, I lost my baby,” Linda wept.

Margaret Auma

Margaret felt a sharp pain right below her abdomen on August 14, 2023.

She was rushed to Kisumu County Referral Hospital. During her previous visit to the facility, the health worker had advised that the baby could come any time and she was advised to visit the hospital in case of any discomfort.

At the facility, she was informed that the baby was due and could come anytime. By then, she was three centimetres dilated. She moved to the maternity wing. The following day, although she was still in pain, the 42-year-old was informed that she was only two centimetres dilated.

She, however, remained in bed till the next morning when she was asked to go for an ultrasound to check on the movement of the baby.

“I dragged myself to the ultrasound department and when I came back, I handed over the results to the nurse in charge who said that I would be induced for a faster reaction.

Five hours later, nothing had happened, there were no drugs to perform the medical procedure. The family bought the drugs from a private facility. Hours after induction, there was no contraction.

She was booked via caesarean section. A couple of medical examinations revealed the baby was not moving. She was placed on oxygen and wheeled to the theatre.

“Unfortunately, my baby was born dead. I later learned that the ultrasound results revealed that the baby had an umbilical cord around her head and neck.

“Had they performed the C-section immediately after the ultrasound, my baby could have survived,” said a teary Margaret.

Immaculate Wamboi

A month ago, a miracle occurred as a new life entered the world, its mother having endured several miscarriages.

At exactly 2pm on a Friday, the cry of a newborn echoed through the corridors of the maternity wing at Mama Lucy Hospital, Nairobi.  But the joy was short-lived.

“After a couple of minutes, the baby went silent, followed by a loud deafening silence in the room; with doctors moving with urgency and tension,” narrates Immaculate.

Immaculate says she sensed that something was wrong. Having given birth normally, she could see everything happening in the room. The doctors were gathered around her baby as they administered chest compressions.

“I could hear one of the doctors instructing his colleagues to administer the compression harder. In all this, no one was talking to me. I was asking questions with no one responding to them. Is my baby okay, I screamed. Yes, she is okay,” responded the doctor in charge.

This was followed by the cry of a distressed newborn after one of the doctors delivered a sharp slap on her back. I was relieved that my baby was okay. The baby’s cry grew stronger and then she went silent. Baby Blessing was gone.

She recalls moments before her delivery that she says led to the death of an angel that she so waited for.

“After all that waiting for a baby, I will never hold her or see her grow. After all the attachment I had with my unborn baby, my bond is just broken like that,” wept Immaculate as we visited her at her home in Kariobangi North.

She says she got to the hospital at 10am when she was already in labour. She kept calling the nurses and no one was attending to her only for them to give her attention when the baby was coming out.

“I guess my baby was tired. Had they attended to me on time, I would be carrying my baby now,” wept Immaculate, adding that every moment I get to see an expectant mother, it reminds me of my child,” she says.

How Kenya can improve maternal and child health

Poor infrastructure in arid and semi-arid counties is a major cause of maternal and neonatal deaths. Last year, for instance, in Marsabit County, Marawato Mifo lost her three-year-old child. An ambulance called from Marsabit Referral Hospital got stuck for three days in the Kambinye area, which is about 50 kilometres from her village, Kargi.

“Although we have done so well in the past with childcare indicators pointing to progress, we need to do more by strengthening our health systems and providing the needed material and human resources for better outcomes for our mothers and children,” said Dr Walter Otieno, a paediatrician based at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital.

Dr Otieno said the national government and counties should develop efficient referral systems to ensure that newborns requiring specialised care are quickly and safely transferred to appropriate facilities.

“We need to also work on providing transportation support for families in remote areas to access healthcare services promptly. A majority of mothers lose their pregnancy or even get to the hospital when it is very late and the baby is gone,” Dr Otieno said.

Ms Angela Nguku, founder and executive director of White Ribbon Alliance, which focuses on ending maternal mortality and improving the health of mothers and newborns, said she is bothered by the fact that policymakers and those who make resourcing decisions for maternal and newborn health mostly look at health care systems as simply building a health facility. “Strong health systems are composed of so much more than buildings. We need to first take a pause and introspect. Listen to what the users; the mothers and their newborns tell us, and at least and for once hear them out. We need to listen to what the health care workers are telling us too by asking them what they need to be supported with. We need these facilities to be staffed with well-trained and supported health workers and filled with supplies and equipment to deliver high-quality, life-saving care,” said Ms Nguku.

She added: “My call to action is simple: Make maternal and newborn health a major priority and everyone’s business. Otherwise, we will have failed the very mothers, newborns and communities that we purport to care for through the many documents, forums, and processes that we are engaged in on a day-to-day basis.”

Pending bills nightmare as State allocates zero budget,"Businesses holding out for payments from the government for working capital are set for tougher times after the National Treasury did not allocate funds for the payment of pending bills running into hundreds of billions of shillings in the latest Supplementary Budget despite earlier promises to do so.

Private sector players had pegged their hopes on the Supplementary Budget II for the partial settlement of their dues following comments by Treasury principal secretary Chris Kiptoo earlier this year that the government would begin to pay claims once they were verified by a special committee President William Ruto created in June 2023.

The Pending Bills Verification Committee tabled its first report last month, showing that it has so far certified pending bills worth Sh110 billion.

By September last year, the national and county governments owed suppliers and contractors Sh631.56 billion. State corporations were the biggest debtors at Sh509.37 billion, with the balance owed by county governments and ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs).

The failure to make provisions for these dues in the second mini-budget of the fiscal year now risks hurting businesses struggling to service obligations to their creditors on cash flow constraints.

These obligations include servicing bank loans, where the stock of bad loans had climbed to an 18-year high of 16.1 percent of the banking sector’s loan book by the end of April from 15.5 percent in February, translating to more than Sh630 billion in defaults.

Last week, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said that the increases in non-performing loans (NPLs) were noted in the agriculture, real estate, tourism, restaurant and hotels, trade and building and construction sectors.

Cash-strained businesses have also resorted to laying off staff or freezing hiring, negatively affecting economic growth and the ability of the government to collect enough taxes to meet the set budgetary expenditure.

The National Assembly’s Budget and Appropriations Committee, in its report of the Supplementary Budget, faulted the Treasury for failing to make a provision for paying part of the pending bills, terming it a significant risk for the stability of affected businesses.

“This lack of provision is worrisome because budget adjustments are likely to lead to the accumulation of pending bills. Such a scenario has significant implications for the balance sheet and economic growth, as it further squeezes liquidity from businesses,” said the Committee in its report.

“The accumulation of pending bills can hinder the financial health of these businesses, potentially leading to cash flow challenges and affecting their operational stability.”

The accumulation of pending bills indicates a failure by State agencies to adhere to the Treasury directives that they settle old debts before committing to new projects.

The Public Finance Management (National Government) Regulations 2015 require State agencies to settle pending bills as a first charge in their budgets.



In a statement to the National Assembly on the Supplementary Budget II, the Treasury cited challenges in revenue collection that have led to delays in exchequer releases, escalation of debt service costs, and settlement of expenditure carryovers from the 2022/2023 fiscal year and settlement of pending bills.

The Supplementary Appropriation Bill, which was assented to on Monday by the President, set the overall budget for 2023/2024 at Sh3.848 trillion.

This was an increase of Sh102 billion compared to the original estimate set in the June 2023 budget but also reflects a cut of Sh133 billion from the revised expenditure of Sh3.981 trillion that had been set in the Supplementary I Budget of November 2023.

The Treasury also cited expenditure pressure from increased demand for resources to cater for emerging priority spending interventions such as the El Nino and security operations.

In the 10 months to April, the government had collected a total revenue of Sh2.179 trillion against a pro-rated target of Sh2.402 trillion, therefore suffering a shortfall of Sh222.2 billion, as per disclosures in the budget committee report.

Taxes, or ordinary revenue, had yielded Sh1.826 trillion against a target of Sh2.094 trillion, indicating a shortfall of Sh267.9 billion. This shortfall in taxes was partially offset by an overperformance of Sh45.4 billion in ministerial appropriations-in-aid.

The revenue shortfall in the current year has been seen despite the government putting in place enhanced tax measures that were meant to expand tax revenue by Sh530 billion to Sh2.57 trillion in the 2023/2024 fiscal year.

The initial revenue estimate contained in the June 2023 Budget has, however, been scaled down by Sh119 billion in the second supplementary budget, which now projects taxes to yield Sh2.45 trillion.

Auditor flags ADC’s puzzling Sh500 per acre land leases,"State-owned Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) leased land to an unnamed investor at more than 10 times lower than the market rate or Sh500 an acre annually, highlighting the misuse of government property in deals with investors.

The ADC leased 15,000 acres in Rumuruti, Laikipia County, to an unnamed tenant in 2015 for 15 years, the Auditor-General revealed in a deal that will cost taxpayers more than Sh1 billion over the period.

This illustrates the practice of State agencies offering public assets for use by private companies at far below market rates.

“The Corporation entered into an agreement with a tenant for the lease of land in Rumuruti measuring 15,000 acres for 15 years. The lease was effective from 1 October 2015 at a lease rent of Sh500 per acre per annum,” says a report by Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu.

Leasing an acre of land for farming ranges between Sh6,000 and Sh10,000 in most parts of the country.

The audit shows that after five years of leasing out the 15,000 acres, the size was reduced to 13,103 acres in October 2019.

This means that ADC will have earned Sh103 million from leasing the land when the tenure of the deal ends in 2030.

At Sh6,000 an acre, the corporation would have earned Sh1.24 billion and Sh2 billion at Sh10,000 annually.

This shows ADC will have lost more than Sh1.1 billion in the sweetheart deal offered to the mystery investor.

“In a correspondence dated 27 February 2017, the surveyors had indicated that 1,897 acres had been lost due to illegal grazers invading the said piece of land. In addition, no further correspondence has been seen to explain what has since transpired with the 1,897 acres that are no longer in the custody of the tenant,” the audit established.

Most government institutions holding land and real estate properties turn to leasing to generate cash and ease liquidity challenges.

However, most of the firms have been found to offer the properties at far below market rates.

Cash-strained Moi University, for instance, opened up 1,500 acres of land within its main Kesses campus in Eldoret for farming leases early this year, noting that investors would take up the land for 60 months for maize farming.

The university made the announcement amid a push by the Ministry of Agriculture to open idle public land for revenue generation and improvement of food security under its land commercialisation initiative (LCI) targeting to lease up to 500,000 acres of idle land and attract at least Sh65 billion in agricultural investments.

“The government of Kenya seeks interested and qualified commercial agribusinesses and investors with demonstrated technical and financial capacity to undertake farming, (agri-)forestry, and other agriculture-related activities on land sites identified under the LCI,” the ministry said in a tender call for investors to take up land in Samburu and Kiambere held by the NYS and Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (Tarda) in February.

Other lands identified for the LCI include Egerton University where 200 acres have been set apart for an agro-science park, 10,000 acres at the Galana Kulalu irrigation scheme, and 25,000 acres of Bura Irrigation Scheme.

The ADC lease is one of the many issues affecting more than 20,000 acres of the corporation’s lands and which continue to risk the continued sustenance of its crucial role in supporting Kenya’s agriculture.

Close to 9,000 acres of its lands across the country have either been encroached on, have ownership disputes in court, or the corporation lacks titles to prove ownership.

The Auditor-General reveals the corporation lacks ownership documents for seven parcels measuring 5,982 acres while 475 acres are under ownership disputes in court.

The parcels include two in the Ndabibi area, Naivasha, Nakuru County, measuring 2,446 acres, which the audit notes are pending registration.

The bold Isiolo girls taking on their parents against FGM,"In the 22 female genital mutilation hotspot counties, parents are known to wield a lot of powers. In these counties, prevalence of the outlawed cultural practice is still high.

Both fathers and mothers have the final say when it comes to the matters touching on subjecting their daughters to female genital mutilation (FGM).

For decades, their word has been final and their daughters have all the time religiously followed their directive to undergo female circumcision without question.

However, the scenario is now changing with girls, particularly in Isiolo, boldly taking on their parents or guardians to evade FGM.

Girls at risk of FGM are telling off their parents and standing their ground against mutilation. They have mastered the art of running away and seeking refuge in numerous rescue centres in the expansive county.

They are also reporting their parents to the police and local administration, leading to many arrests. Reporting to authorities was unheard of before.

One such girl who escaped a year ago after defying her parents is Mercy Leluata*. She recalls how her one evening in March last year, her mother told her to get ready as they would be commencing FGM preparations.

Mercy tells Nation.Africa that the news was traumatising as she knew that the die was cast and she would soon face the knife.

“I told her that FGM would happen to me over my dead body. I indicated to her that the outlawed cultural practice had a lot of negative effects on girls and women. I threatened that I would report her to the police. She got scared and told me not to report her to the authorities,” Mercy says in an interview.

The following day after the heated argument with her mother, Mercy recalls seeing several groups of women come to their home in the evening.

When supper was served, she recounts being summoned to the hut where an elderly woman smeared her head with mud before shaving her clean. This ritual, she says, was an indication that she would be subjected to FGM early the following morning.

“I had to think and act fast to evade the knife. At around 9pm, as women sang circumcision songs, I excused myself to go to the toilet and got a chance to escape. On the road, I met a girl who is my friend who accompanied me to a rescue centre run by the Catholic Church in Oldonyiro, where I sought refuge.”

Mercy is currently a Grade Seven pupil at Oldonyiro Primary School in Isiolo North. Every evening after classes, she returns to the rescue centre. Many other girls are hosted here.

During school holidays, Mercy reveals that she does not usually go home as she fears being mutilated and married off.

Her father also threatened to kill her if she ever dared set her foot at home, she said. Mercy’s story is no different from that of Esther Lorere*, who also defied her parents.

Esther recalls how one morning in January 2017, her mother relayed a message for her father. The news was chilling. She was required to get ready for the cut after which she would be married off. She was lost for words as all she wanted was to pursue her studies and in future become a doctor.

“I knew if I failed to do something, I would soon get cut and within no time get married off, probably to an old man. I gathered courage and told my mother to go tell my father that I could only be cut over my dead body. She was shocked and asked me where I had got the boldness to defy them,” Esther tells Nation.Africa.

Esther, who is now in Grade Eight, says she hatched a plan and vanished from home at 4am in the morning as her parents slept and ran to the rescue centre.

Since 2017, Esther says she has never gone back home even after she was informed that her father passed away during the Covid-19 crisis. Her fear of being subjected to the cut by the relatives is still rife.

“My mother only came to see me once at the rescue centre since I ran away from home seven years ago. She has never come again. I know she is still upset with me for defying her and my father. It is my hope that she will in future understand that FGM has no place in the modern world and forgive me.”

The story of the two girls is just but the tip of the iceberg of many similar ones that girls here in Isiolo have stood their ground against being cut have to tell.

The girls here have become bold after being empowered, courtesy of the Anti-FGM club started in the school three years ago. Such clubs are in other 21 schools in the county.

The clubs, both in primary and secondary schools, are among others enlightening the students on what FGM entails and what to do in instances when they are at risk of being subjected to the cut.

The girls are also empowered to fight any attempt to subject them to the cut and report their parents or those behind the push to the police or local administration.

The clubs are also working with male pupils and students to change their belief that they can only marry girls who are cut. Besides the pupils and students, the clubs are also working with teachers and parents to convert them into allies in the fight against FGM.

These clubs are the brainchild of Amref Health Africa and are being implemented by the Girl Generation in conjunction with Action Aid.

“The club has assisted us to know my rights, what the law says about FGM and the medical implications of being subjected to the cut. It has really opened our eyes and those of many other girls and even boys. They have come to let us know that FGM is illegal, something many of us did not know,” Mercy notes.

Margaret Abenyo, a teacher who is in charge of the Anti-FGM Club and Girl’s Forum at Oldonyiro Primary School, underscores the importance of the club.

“FGM is rampant in the area. Many girls have dropped out of school, are cut and married off. The club has helped to enlighten the girls on their rights and the negative effects of FGM. It has taught them why they should stand firm against the vice,” says Ms Abenyo.

She notes that the clubs, which have more than 200 pupils both girls and boys, have contributed to creating awareness of FGM and seen girls become bold and say no to their parents.

“We now have many more girls in class than boys, which was not the case before. Between 2010 and 2015, girls were, for example, fewer in classes. The awareness created is going a long way in changing the cultural belief of the locals on matters FGM,” Ms Abenyo tells Nation.Africa.

The initiative is also targeting boys to make them change their mind about FGM, she says. In the cultures that practise circumcision of girls, men are not allowed to marry uncut girls.

The teacher notes the boys in the school have been receptive to the campaign.

Viola Ruto, the GBV/Child Protection Lead at the Amref Health Africa, says their resolve to work with schools is to empower young girls who are mostly at risk of the cut.

She observes that the impact of the clubs has been phenomenal, key among them is increasing the confidence of the girls to stand firm against FGM. She singles out incorporating boys in the fight.

“We want to transform the boys into sources of change. Boys can have essential interventions in the fight against FGM. As students, they can go back home and change the perception of their parents.”

Ms Ruto reveals that plans are in top gear to roll out the programme in more schools and counties.

The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) indicates that about 4 million girls and women in Kenya have undergone FGM. Overall, 21 per cent of girls and women aged 15–49 have been subjected to the practice.

If the current trend continues, the United Nations Fund for Population (UNFPA) estimates that 86 million girls born from 2010–15 will be at risk by 2030.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 200 million girls and women globally have undergone mutilation. The majority of the girls are cut before they turn 15.

Many of the girls who undergo FGM face short-term complications such as severe pain, shock, bleeding, infections, and difficulty in passing urine, as well as long-term implication for their sexual, reproductive health and mental health.

Kenya banned the practice in 2011, paving the way for the Female Genital Mutilation Act, 2011, that carries a minimum punishment of three-year imprisonment and a Sh200,000 fine.

Causes and risk factors for male infertility,"Dear doctor,

My wife and I have been trying to get a baby for the past three years unsuccessfully. She has six-year-old child from a previous relationship, so I know she is able to get children. The problem must be with me. What can I do about this? Dan



Dear Dan,

About one in seven couples have challenges with achieving a pregnancy after trying for at least one year. While not commonly discussed, the male partner has health challenges that contribute to sub-fertility about half of the time when an underlying issue is identified.

Reduced fertility in men may be due to low sperm count, blockage of sperm flow, or abnormal sperm function. The most severe form is lack of sperm production, called azoospermia. Possible causes of reduced fertility include problems with functioning of the testicles, undescended testicles, blockage of the testicular ducts, ejaculatory dysfunction, hormone problems and genetic disorders. Rarely, the sperm count may be low due to an immune system disorder, where there is production of anti-sperm antibodies that attack the sperms. Factors that can contribute to male infertility include injury, testicular infections or tumours, obesity, alcoholism, smoking or chronic illnesses like diabetes, liver disease, among others. Previous testicular surgery and major abdominal/pelvic surgery are also a risk factor. Exposure to some medications like steroids, chemotherapy and other medications, radiotherapy and environmental toxins can also contribute. Exposing the testicles to too much heat is also a risk factor.

It is advisable for you to be reviewed by a urologist for examination and relevant tests. The tests may include semen analysis, scrotal ultrasound and other tests as need be such as prostrate examination, checking hormone levels, urine tests and testicular biopsy. The treatment will be tailored according to the underlying cause. It is also advisable for your wife to be evaluated in case a problem has developed since she last delivered. In the event that conception cannot be achieved normally, there is assisted reproduction available.

Doc,

Could there be an anti-alcohol drug anywhere in Kenya? I hope it is there, I really need it.

ZM

Dear ZM,

When you are concerned about your alcohol consumption, or if you have tried to cut down the drinking without success, or if you feel guilty about drinking or you continue drinking despite experiencing negative effects of whatever form, then it is likely you have an alcohol use disorder. This is usually due to regularly taking large amounts of alcohol.

In addition, you may have alcohol dependency (addiction) if you cannot function without taking alcohol, or if you have to take more to achieve the same effects, or if you get withdrawal symptoms when you don’t take alcohol, or if you spend a lot of time thinking about or indulging in alcohol and use a lot of resources to get the alcohol.

Treatment of alcohol use disorder and dependency starts with acknowledging there is a problem and being willing to change. The recovery is usually a process and may take a long time. Managing alcohol use disorder usually depends on how much alcohol you usually take and the goal, whether it is to stop completely, or to reduce alcohol consumption to a manageable level. If the alcohol intake is mild, you can stop just by choosing to abstain. For moderate use, you can manage yourself from home with regular check up by a medical professional. For alcohol dependency, it is advisable for you to be managed as an inpatient. The medications used may be for:

Managing withdrawal side effects

Reducing cravings

Preventing relapse

Reducing amount of alcohol taken

Generating negative side effects in case you take alcohol

The most important part of the treatment is psychotherapy, which includes individual, group and family therapy. Initially, the therapy may be in an institution or from an outpatient set up. It’s also important to have someone to walk with you through the journey of recovery.

Dear doctor,

What could be causing muscle cramps in the legs?



Dear reader,

A muscle cramp refers to the sudden unintentional contraction/tightening of a muscle, and sometimes it can be painful. In most cases, muscle cramps last for a short time though sometimes they may last for long, such as muscle cramps in the lower back leading to abnormal positioning of the spine. A muscle cramp may develop following over-exercise or overuse of a certain muscle group, or due to lack of stretching before exercising, or due to muscle injury. Cramps may also develop because of uncomfortable positioning of the legs for a long time. Underlying conditions that may trigger muscle cramps include dehydration, mineral deficiencies, nerve problems, poor blood flow, some chronic illnesses (such as diabetes, thyroid disease, liver or kidney disease) and use of certain medications. Sometimes there is no underlying cause identified.

When you experience a muscle cramp, you can relieve it by:  Stretching.  Massage  Gentle exercise such as walking. Warm or cold compresses.  Muscle-relaxing medication

If the muscle cramps are recurrent or if they are severe, it is advisable to be reviewed by a health professional for thorough evaluation. Any underlying issues should be treated such as taking mineral supplements to address deficiencies. Muscle cramps can be prevented or reduced by taking a healthy and well balanced diet, adequate water intake, maintaining proper posture, regular exercise and stretching before and after exercising.

Stars face Cote d’Ivoire in toughest test yet in Fifa World Cup qualifiers,"Kenya’s Harambee Stars face the toughest challenge yet in their journey to qualifying for 2026 Fifa World Cup this afternoon when they face reigning African champions Cote d’Ivoire at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi.

The first leg match of the Group “F” qualifiers will kick-off at 4pm (Kenyan time).

Football Kenya Federation (FKF) was forced to seek an alternative venue for Kenya’s matches against Burundi which was played on Friday, and today’s match against Cote d’Ivoire for lack of a local stadium that meets Fifa standards for hosting international matches.

Kenya and Burundi battled to a 1-1 draw on Friday at the same venue.

African champions Cote d’Ivoire, who boast several European-based stars, are favourites to win today, having won all their three matches of the pool. Cote d’Ivoire, who top the group with nine points, three more than second-placed Gabon, beat the Panthers 1-0 at Amadou Gon Coulibaly Stadium in Korhogo on Friday.

Four points

Harambee Stars are third in the group with four points, same as Burundi while Gambia are fifth with three points.Bottom-placed Seychelles have no point.

On Friday, midfielder Seko Fofana’s 36th minute strike was all the three-time African champions needed to maintain their winning streak in the pool.

The Elephants are coached by Emerse Fae.

In their two opening matches of the group played in November last year, Cote dÍvoire hammered visitors Seychelles 9-0 and later defeated hosts Gambia 2-0.

Striker Sebastian Haller (Borussia Dortmund), Simon Adingra (Brighton and Hove Albion), Franck Kessie, Nicolas Pepe, Yahia Fofana, and Seko Fofana are among the star players in the Elephants’ squad.

Haller’s winning goal helped Cote d’Ivoire rally from behind to defeat Nigeria 2-1 in the final of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations played at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan.

On Monday, June 10, Fae said they will not underrate Kenya.

“We have to be composed to get good results against Kenya. They drew with Burundi, so we have to be on top of our game to stop them in the match because they really need the three points as the home side,” said Fae. He singled out Michael Olunga as among the star players in the Kenyan squad to watch out for.

Speaking in Lilongwe, Harambee Stars coach Firat said that since they have played a couple of friendly matches against top sides, his players are not intimidated by Cote d’Ivoire.

“Since I came to Kenya, we played some strong teams. I want the boys to get some self-confidence so that they don’t feel a lesser team. I hope we will not have major self-confidence problems,” said the Turk. Kenya defeated hosts Qatar 2-1 in a friendly match played on September 7 last year. Stars then battled to a 2-2- draw against Russia in another friendly match held on October 16 last year in Turkey.

Firat lamented that his plans in the two matches has been scuttled by the unavailability of several players.

Budget team urges Treasury to cancel Sh90.7bn KBC debt,"The National Assembly budget and appropriation committee has directed the National Treasury to cancel a Sh90.7 billion debt allegedly owed to it by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) following questions about the validity of the loan.

The debt relates to the exchequer’s takeover of a loan contracted from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan in 1989 which funded the State corporation’s modernisation programme.

“By September 30, 2024, the Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury, in collaboration with the State Department for Broadcasting and Telecommunication should ensure that the necessary book reconciliations regarding the Japanese loan are concluded and consequently expunged from the liabilities of Kenya Broadcasting Corporation,” the committee said in a report on its consideration of the 2024/25 budget estimates.

In its audit of KBC books for the year ended June 2022, the Auditor General expressed difficulties in confirming the outstanding loan balance amid the non-disclosure of key financial statements by the exchequer relating to the facility.

KBC had requested the National Treasury to meet the loan payment obligation after its inability to settle the outstanding facility.

According to the 2021/22 KBC annual report, KBC had expected to reimburse the exchequer a loan facility at market interest rates and made subsequent provisions between the 1992/93 financial year and 2021/2022, paying up a total of Sh13.6 billion.

At the same time, the State corporation indicated that the Treasury had charged interest of Sh77 billion over the years on the loan and showed a schedule of payments up to June 2022.



The Auditor General however challenged the interest payments, noting it exceeded the principal amount.

“The principal loan amount was Sh13.6 billion but has over the years accrued interest amounting to Sh77 billion. This violates the duplum rule as the loan is non-performing and the accrued interest exceeds the principal amount,” the Auditor General notes in the audit of KBC financials.

According to the Auditor General, further records provided in the audit indicated a demand note on the payments by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) amounting to Sh1.6 billion in November 2019.

During the 2019/20 financial year however, the National Treasury only made payments amounting to Sh335,207 on behalf of KBC but there were no disclosures on the amount due and unpaid.

“It was not possible to determine the balance of the Japanese loan since the payments made on behalf of KBC by the National Treasury are inclusive of loan principal, interest, and overdue charges,” the Auditor General added.

“In the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the Japanese loan principal and loan interest balance of Sh90.7 billion could not be confirmed.”

The cancellation of the debt due to the exchequer is expected to clear a significant portion of KBC’s liabilities.

As at the end of June 2022, the State Corporation listed Sh93.6 billion as current liabilities, the bulk of which represented the government loan and Sh2.9 billion in trade and other payables.

In the year to June 2022, KBC narrowed its loss to Sh174.5 million from a loss of Sh313.2 million previously.

The ICT Ministry has recently appointed Agnes Kalekye Nguna as KBC’s new Managing Director and CEO to guide the State corporation into its next phase of growth.

Inside Betty Kibaara's wonderland,"Her love for flowers and plants is evident. Even a collection of photos on her mobile phone gallery cannot truly capture the beauty of her charming mixed garden.

At Betty Kibaara's home in Nairobi's Karen, it feels like walking through a mini-Eden of colours. On a Friday afternoon, I am thrilled to spend time with her in this vibrant garden.

A gate opens to a townhouse, part of an investment that has been cultivated over the years, with a beautiful driveway. The breeze on the grounds is cool, making you want to spend the rest of your life in this place.

The boundary wall caught my eye. It has been a while since I have seen it in a city fast-rising with skyscrapers and dots of greenery. Garden lovers loathe concrete jungles.

""When I bought the house in 2016, the land was bare. The concrete wall stood out. My mother even suggested I buy a house in Kileleshwa, but I told her to relax. I already knew what I wanted to do with the space,"" says Betty.

Seven years later, the one-acre piece of land has transformed magnificently into a serene environment.

""We were looking for a serene environment away from the hustle of the city. A quiet and peaceful place. A landscaper charged me Sh600,000 which was so expensive, so I bought his plan and got one of the flower men from Ngong Road to help me,"" she says.

Betty's home is now beautifully adorned with a climbing fig that has brought nothing but peace and beauty for seven years. To soften the hard surfaces, a blend of art stands out. The artist has combined bold splashes of colour with lush plants, making the wall almost unnoticeable.

“I love the climbing fig because it greens my wall and turns the concrete jungle into a fruit forest,” says Betty.

Our tour of the garden begins in her front yard, where she has over 200 varieties of flowers and plants, either planted in the ground or potted.

In the past 20 years, two things have driven her mixed gardening.

""I grew up in a village where we didn't have to buy onions. We could just go behind the house and pick some. So I have a farming background,"" she says.

""I'm also a healthy eater and I like to produce my food. I like to grow things and eat them. That way I am sure they don't have chemicals,"" says the 50-year-old who doesn't look a day older than 40.

Every mini-Eden has a waterfall and Betty has beautifully installed hers outside the front door.

""When Covid-19 struck people were locked indoors. When I contacted a plumber, she quoted Sh100,000. Thanks to YouTube, I saved my money and got exactly what I wanted done,"" she says.

In the front garden, the clusters of plants such as jade, African daisies, cactus, ferns, air plants, berries, and birds of paradise provide colour.

She is working on adding healthier trees to the garden, and the soursop represents this effort. It is the fruit of Annona muricata, a deciduous flowering evergreen tree known for its antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-malarial properties.

Her first plant, the geranium, is in bloom.""I love it because it does well all year round, but it doesn't like rain,"" says Betty.

Along the driveway, she has a mix of pink, white, and red roses, beautifully blending into the space.

“I planted them last year in memory of my late mum Rose Mary. Every time I feel and smell the roses I remember that she is in a good place,” she says.

This is also one of her favourite spots because it hosts her best flower. Fuchsia - the brightest pink-purple, native to America and New Zealand, and commonly grown as an ornamental.

""I like to put it in a glass of water and see how it floats on the water. I call it the floating fuchsia,"" says Betty.

The backyard is a showstopper, featuring a relatively small, manicured lawn and a variety of plants in hanging pots.

Some of the plants include monstera, gooseberry, traveller's palm, ponytail, and golden palm. Anthurium, a high-end flower with heart-shaped spathes that symbolise affection, making it a perfect alternative to traditional red roses, is also at home in the backyard garden.

Additionally, the garden features the moonflower, which is loved by bees and has a lovely fragrance that is only noticeable at night.

""I planted grass many times before I found out that different grasses grow well in different climates, in shade, and in direct sunlight,"" she says.

The garden also boasts fruit-bearing plants such as grapes, avocados, cherry guavas, and oranges, completing this wonderful mix.

""The grapes are doing very well, so we are going to extend it,"" she says. Ginger, lantana and apples are well-established.

The wondrous artichoke, scientifically known as Cynara scolymus, always reminds her when to water the garden.

""When it is 'thirsty' it gets so sad and the leaves start to thin. So when I am away, I just ask for its photo to know when the garden needs watering,"" she says.

What does it take to create such an ecological oasis? I ask. ""Passion and hard work,"" she replies and says, “Let me show you something.""

At the back of the garden hosts again a variety of plants, an edible garden with a mix of herbs and fruits. Her vegetable garden is overflowing with leafy greens.

Her homemade tea consists of a blend of various herbs she has cultivated, including rosemary. In her vertical garden, she beautifully grows onions, spinach, cowpea leaves (kunde), amaranth (terere), and black nightshade (managu).

Additionally, she grows coriander (dhania), custard apple (tomoko), bananas, pumpkins, and even sugar cane. Her diverse garden ensures that she has a secure food supply.

""The Hass avocado trees give me 1,000 fruits a year. I can't remember the last time I bought avocados, we always have them in the kitchen,"" she says.

Betty is enjoying the fruits of her labour.

Next to the banana plant is a beehive she gave her son for his birthday. It produces 15 kilogrammes of honey a year for the family.

Well, the plants don't just thrive out of nowhere, she uses rabbit urine as a pesticide and chicken and insect manure, all from her farm. ""I will soon be going completely organic,"" she says.

I see a lot of snails sitting on the leaves of flowers and trees. I am curious to know if they are a nuisance. Well, her answer surprises me.

""If you want to know a good garden, it is one that is diverse, the more diversity you have, the better your garden is,"" she says.

With such a garden, having plenty of water for irrigation is crucial. ""Water is important; I don't want to take any risks. I have rainwater, tap water and community water,"" she says.

The special thing about her garden is that it combines beauty with food. What she calls diversity.

""Where else would you find more than 200 species of flora and fauna? And the fact that it's not structured, it's all diverse, with a mix of fruits, flowers and plants,"" she boasts.

Is she happy with the development of her garden?

""We host events and artists also use the space to record their videos. I also spend a lot of time in the garden and feel good about it,"" says Betty.

She has spent no more than Sh20,000 on the garden so far.

""It would have been more, but my learned farming skills saved the day,"" says the certified agricultural economist.

No one cuts a flower from her garden without asking her first. Her next project is to name all the plants in her garden.

Our conversation is interrupted by a rat-a-tat. She points to some birds perched on an old tree.

This is a common occurrence in her garden. ""They complete the ecosystem,"" she says. There is, however, one challenge. ""We have to net the strawberries because they eat a lot of them.""

While her journey seems so beautiful, Betty has had her fair share of challenges, which she says have made her stronger. Her biggest challenge is the whiteflies, which feed on the undersides of plant leaves.

""When I started, I made a lot of mistakes, but it turned out well. Now I have mastered the art of plants and the weather. I can tell which flower will bloom where and which will wither,"" she says.

To add more art to her space, she plans to add a little bit of the art world, consisting of animal sculptures like the elephant.

Final words? ""The most important thing in gardening is patience,"" says the mother of two.

CIC gets nod for three new subsidiaries in growth drive,"CIC Insurance Group shareholders have approved the creation of three new subsidiaries, including a pharmaceutical company, a micro-insurance arm, and a Ugandan asset management firm as part of a business expansion drive by the insurer.

The resolutions were passed during an annual general meeting last Friday.

The Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed insurer plans to establish a micro-insurance subsidiary dubbed CIC Micro Insurance Limited following authorisation from shareholders.

“That the incorporation and establishment of CIC Micro Insurance Limited as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CIC Insurance Group Plc, having such authorised, issued, and paid up capital as the board may determine from time to time, be and is hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved,” read the annual report.

CIC had earlier launched a micro-insurance product focusing on livestock farmers.

The livestock micro insurance policy was first launched in 2009, as a cattle mortality cover for low-income dairy farmers shielding them from financial losses.

The listed insurer disclosed in the latest annual report that the group plans to venture into the pharmaceutical business with the newly established CIC Pharmacy Limited, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of CIC Group.

The group also is establishing an asset management firm in Uganda as a subsidiary of CIC Africa (Uganda).

The insurer provides financial services in Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Malawi offering general, life insurance, medical assurance, and asset management services.

CIC invested Sh4.29 billion in subsidiaries in the year ended December 2023.

The group spent about Sh50 million on the new CIC micro insurance limited in the year ended December 2023.

The insurer had invested Sh779.3 million in CIC Africa Uganda Limited towards the asset management firm.

CIC maintained a Sh0.13 per share dividend amounting to Sh340 million after posting a record Sh1.44 billion net profit for the year ended December 2023.

This was the first full year of profit under the new accounting rules dubbed the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS17) that replaced IFRS4 in January.

The new standard demands that insurers measure insurance contracts using updated estimates and assumptions that reflect the timing of cash flows and any uncertainty relating to insurance contracts.

IFRS 17 accounting integration and allocations require considerable changes to reporting and disclosures that are driven by data and modelling inputs.

These also need actuarial modelling integration and the accounting ledger and must include control audit, and reconciliation.

Retired civil servants suffer Sh2.1bn bond paper losses,"The Public Service Superannuation Fund (PSSF) realised Sh2.1 billion in paper losses across two financial years to June 2023 from the revaluation of its holdings in government securities.

The revaluation losses are due to falling bond prices in the past year amid a rise in interest rates on Treasuries in both the primary and secondary market, warranting devaluation in the carrying value of the securities.

Such losses are recognised as an operating cost similar to depreciation.

While the PSSF may not realise the losses by holding their purchased government papers to term, the scheme disclosed the Sh2.1billion paper loss, which comprises Sh1.8 billion in fair value losses in the year to June, Sh714.1 million in losses prior, less Sh425.4 million in prior year’s accrued interest income.

PSSF, the State-run pension scheme that draws contributions from government employees including the public service, teachers, and the police, which are matched by the exchequer invests primarily in Treasury bills and bonds.

In the financial year ended June 2023, the fund had Sh77.9 billion invested in government securities including Sh71.5 billion in Treasury bonds and Sh6.3 billion in bills.

In the financial year to June 2023, the fund raised its investment in Treasury bonds from Sh35.9 billion while investing Sh8.3 billion in Treasury bills during the period.

The fund however lost Sh3 billion from the sale of papers in the same period including Sh1 billion from disposed Treasury bonds and Sh1.9 billion from the sale of Treasury bills.

PSSF invested 98.8 percent of its assets over the review period in government securities against the statutory maximum threshold of 90 percent, leaving it at odds with the provisions of the Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA).

The fund nevertheless notes it decided to invest in government securities as a risk mitigation measure following the Covid-19 pandemic shock.



“The fund has adopted a result-oriented and risk-based approach in order to balance between appetite for good returns and risk exposure. Owing to the impact of Covid-19 on investment returns, the board decided to invest in government securities so as to ensure guaranteed returns on the investments,” PSSF stated in its annual report.

The PSSF however held Sh904.1 million in cash and cash equivalents including Sh11.6 million in current accounts and Sh792.5 million in on-call deposits and fixed deposits.

Despite its conservative stance, the pension scheme is allowed to invest in other asset classes including equities, immovable properties, guaranteed funds, corporate bonds, offshore, private equity, and real estate investment trusts (Reits).

During the year to June 2023, the scheme earned Sh5.5 billion from its investments including Sh5.2 billion from Treasury bonds, Sh180.8 million in Treasury bills, and Sh55.9 million in cash investments and fixed deposits.

The fund earned additional income in the period from interest on bank balances and from the purchase of government securities.

PSVs to raise fares if Motor Vehicle Tax passes,"Kenyans relying on Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) could soon be hit with a steep increase in price for daily commute if the proposed amendment of the Income Tax Act introducing Motor Vehicle Tax is adopted as envisioned in Finance Bill 2024, operators warned.

PSV operators have told legislators that they risk seeing their expenditure on taxes and levies on the first year of acquiring a new vehicle shoot to as high as 74 percent of the purchase cost should the proposed Motor Vehicle Tax sail through in its present form.

In its submission before the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee regarding Finance Bill 2024 proposals, the Federation of Public Transport Sector argues that 33-seater mini-buses and 51-seater buses will take the hardest hit with year one taxes and levies, including Motor Vehicle Tax, standing at an estimated Sh4.9 million against the prevailing average purchase price of Sh6.6 million for the 33-seater and an estimated Sh6.3 million for the 51-seater averaging Sh8.5 million in the purchase price.

This means that for 33-seater mini-buses, year-one taxes, and levies will be at 74 percent of the cost of a newly acquired unit.

“The Federation of Public Transport Sector would like to call on all Kenyans and especially the National Assembly to reject the proposed Motor Vehicle Tax on concerns that it will drastically push up the cost of acquiring a PSV and increase the cost of doing business. To avoid losses, public transport operators who often operate a fleet of vehicles will certainly pass this cost to passengers,” the federation told the Finance and Planning Committee.



According to the federation, a 14-seater fetching an average of Sh5.3 million will attract 69 percent of its unit cost, or just about Sh3.7 million, in year one taxes and levies, while a 51-seater fetching an average of Sh8.5 million will attract 74 percent of its unit cost in year one taxes and levies at just about Sh6.3 million.

The federation has also cast doubts over the proposed use of insurance companies as collecting agents for the tax proposed via the introduction of Section 12H to the Income Tax Act.

Read: Vehicle owners to pay annual tax of up to Sh100,000

“Due to the current poor health and hygiene of insurance companies that underwrite the risk of PSV transport, it will not be prudent to entrust them to collect Motor Vehicle Tax on behalf of government yet they cannot pay claims, let alone them being going concerns. The cost and process of carrying out the annual valuation will lead to corruption”, the federation says.

The government targets collecting Sh58 billion in the financial year 2024/25 through the Motor Vehicle Tax which has been proposed at 2.5 percent of the value of a vehicle with the floor set at Sh5,000 and the ceiling set at Sh100,000.

"Why CEOs plan to fire 370,000 employees","More chief executives (CEOs) plan to trim their workforce this year, a new survey by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows, citing declining business performance and cost-cutting.

The survey shows that in just five months, company executives (in the non-banking sector) have raised the number of jobs they plan to cut this year by more than 60,000.

This is after the CEOs and senior staff of 215 companies, in a survey conducted by the CBK last month, indicated that the number of employees they “definitely won’t” retain in 2024 is 18 percent of the employees they had last year.

This is a rise from the planned layoffs of 15 percent of the employees the companies employed last year, as indicated in a similar survey conducted in January.

“Non-bank respondents, on the other hand, expressed the need to cut costs and improve efficiency as reasons for not hiring in 2024. Some, however, expressed concern about industry decline as a result of the challenging business environment,” the CBK survey stated.

Non-bank private firms employed 2,073,600 persons last year, according to the 2024 Economic Survey.

To cut 18 percent would translate to 373,248 jobs that company executives said would be shed this year, an increase from 311,040 jobs (15 percent of the 2023 jobs), as per the January survey.

The number of jobs company executives in the non-bank sector are sure to retain this year has remained at a constant seven percent of jobs they had last year, while those they are sure won’t be retained has risen from 15 percent to 18 percent.

The growth in the number of employees non-bank companies express they “definitely won’t” retain in 2024 has been marked amid growing concerns of industry decline, high operating costs, technological advancements

The company executives also cited the need to reduce overheads, improve efficiencies, attract new talent, and expand businesses as other top reasons for their employment expectations for 2024.

The survey sought to find out from CEOs and other senior staff of 263 banks, micro-finance banks, and non-bank firms “about their expectations on the number of employees they expected to retain in 2024 compared with 2023.”

“The survey showed lower hiring expectations for 2024 by bank and non-bank private firms,” the CBK notes.

The survey, however, notes that banks have laid down strategies to hire additional staff this year, mainly to replace exiting staff, expand business, and attract new talent.

Bank executives reduced the number of staff they indicate they “definitely won’t” retain in 2024, from 6 percent to 3 percent of staff they had last year.

“Banks expected to hire in 2024 largely to grow business and expand, to attract new talent, and to replace exiting staff,” the CBK stated.

The financial and insurance activities sector, where banks fall, employed 71,900 persons in 2023, according to the Economic Survey, 2024.

The Central Bank sent out questionnaires to 354 executives of banks, micro-finance banks, and non-banks, including 84 hotels, out of whom a total of 263 executives responded.

State fails to remit Sh220m pension for new employees,"The government failed to remit Sh219.9 million in its share of contributions to the Public Service Superannuation Fund (PSSF) in the financial year ending June 2023, revealing emerging risks for the recently established pension scheme.

PSSF, which commenced operations in January of 2021, is a defined contribution scheme under which civil servants pay towards their retirement benefits which are topped up by exchequer contributions.

Civil servants contribute 7.5 percent of their gross salaries from five and two percent previously while the government matches the contribution at 15 percent of civil servants' gross salaries--a shift from the past when the State operated a non-contributory pension scheme financed fully by the exchequer.

Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu said the State has failed to remit its part of the contribution of employee remissions to the PSSF.

“The statement of financial position as disclosed reflects a balance of Sh6.8 billion in respect to receivables from exchange transactions. The balance includes an amount of Sh219,999,201 with respect to the employer’s contributions that remained outstanding as of July 31, 2023 contrary to the PSSF Act which states that, not later than ten working days after the end of the month in which the contributions are due, the government shall remit an amount comprising the member’s and the government’s contribution to the custodian,” the Auditor General noted.

The disclosure of the unremitted contributions points to the raging crisis of deducted but unpaid deductions in the pensions industry.

In February, the Treasury disclosed Sh42.06 billion in unremitted employer contributions by State-owned entities which raises the odds of thousands of workers retiring empty-handed.

The exchequer listed the unremitted employer contributions as the second biggest pending bills for the parastatals.

The PSSF is managed by asset management firm GenAfrica while CPF is the scheme’s administrator and covers civil servants, including teachers employed by the Teachers Service Commission and disciplined forces.

Previously, the government operated a non-contributory pension scheme financed fully by the exchequer.

The model however proved unsustainable as the full burden of the pension bill was placed on taxpayers.

The creation of the PSSS was part of reforms in the public service pensions sector which gave rise to the 2012 Public Service Superannuation Scheme Act.

All public defined benefit schemes were converted to defined contributory schemes aligning the schemes to best industry practices. Civil servants below the age of 45 along with new hires in the sector were obligated to make contributions to the fund while workers aged above 45 were given the option to join the contributory scheme.

PSSF’s scheme membership grew from 368,795 in June 2022 to 416,449 as of June last year with the increase majorly coming from fresh staff recruitment in the police and teachers’ services.

The fund netted Sh5.5 billion in investment returns for the period and had Sh37 billion in total contributions raising the total value of the scheme to Sh84.7 billion.

By February this year, PSSF fund value hit Sh105 billion putting the scheme only second to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

PSSF estimates contributions at an average of Sh3.6 billion per month.

The emergence of pending bills/remittances to the fund thereby reveals new risks posed to the new scheme.

Horticulture earnings defy strong shilling to grow by 15.2 percent,"Earnings from fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and cut flowers grew by 15.2 percent between January and April to defy a strong shilling boosted by higher export volumes.

This comes as Kenya seeks duty-free access to its exports, including fresh produce, to the European Union (EU) and the US through fresh trade deals in addition to recent forays into the vast Asian market, particularly China and India.

Data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows horticulture earnings grew to $363 million (Sh46.9 billion) over the four months, marking a significant rise from $315 million (Sh40.7 billion) earned during the same period last year.

“Export earnings from horticulture have increased with the higher export quantities,” said the CBK.

The higher earnings defied a rapid appreciation of the Kenyan shilling against the US dollar, with the local currency strengthening from an average low of Sh159.7 in January to an average of Sh131.4 in April.

Fresh produce exporters are paid in US dollars, which means that they earn more in Kenyan shillings when the local currency depreciates and less when the shilling strengthens.

The increase in earnings came on the back of significant growth in export volumes, which jumped 57 percent to 246,000 tonnes up from 189,000 tonnes in the same period last year.

Vegetables were the best-performing horticultural crop as earnings grew 38 percent to $83 million (Sh10.7 billion) supported by a 73 percent jump in export volumes.

Earnings from fruits and nuts grew by 22 percent to $92 million (Sh11.9 billion) driven by an increase in export volumes to 83,000 tonnes compared to 73,000 tonnes last year.

On the other hand, a 2 percent decline in export volumes of cut flowers failed to dent earnings from the crop, which grew by 5 percent to hit $189 million (Sh24.4 billion), signalling higher market prices.

Horticulture is one of the leading export earners for Kenya. Other foreign exchange earners include tea, coffee, and tourism.

The Netherlands is the largest market for Kenya’s horticultural exports, particularly cut flowers, followed by the UK, France, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Germany.

China, India, and Kazakhstan are also emerging as major destinations for Kenya’s fresh produce, particularly avocados.

Which medium return investment options should I explore with Sh6m?,"Qn. I have 6,000,000 in cash and I will receive 150,000 a month from a pension for the next 10 years. What are some medium risk/return investment options that I should explore?

The principle of risk and return alludes to the fact that the higher the risk, the higher the possibility of return. The concept suggests that as you take on more risk, you must be prepared to potentially lose an equivalent amount of money.

While this principle serves as a guide for potential investors, it may only sometimes be true. However, for someone like you seeking medium risk/return investments, you can hedge against high risks while still getting income.

You can grow your wealth through proper asset allocation and prudent security selection. Based on your risk profile, consider generating passive income to earn returns from your investments without active involvement.

Below are some investments that you may consider:

Money markets

Money markets are short-term fixed-income instruments that yield interest gains and often offer a higher return than conventional savings accounts. The money market can offer such high returns as fund managers invest in high-quality liquid asset classes like call deposits, treasury bills and commercial paper.

With the money market, you are assured of enough liquidity, competitive interest rates, low risk and access to your finances based on the terms and conditions of the fund manager. The potential payback period is short-term, often less than a year.

Read: Investment options, tips for maximising passive income

Before selecting a money market option, ensure it is licensed by the Capital Markets Authority and has a reliable trustee and custodian in place. Additionally, compare the returns offered by different money market options, assess the credit quality of the underlying assets, consider the fund's liquidity and accessibility of your funds, evaluate any associated costs, and monitor interest rate trends.

Government bonds

The national government issues bonds to finance the budget, fund public projects, and repay existing loans. Bonds will generate returns based on their predetermined coupon rates. Bonds provide periodic interest payments and full repayment of the principal at maturity. This financial asset is generally considered safe as the risk of default is relatively low, ensuring you have a stable income.

However, it is worth noting that bond prices have an inverse relationship with the movement of interest rates. This means that if the prevailing interest rates increase, the value of the existing bonds decreases and vice versa. It would be best if you considered monitoring market trends, inflation levels, and changes in interest rates.

Corporate bonds

When you think of corporate bonds, what should come to mind is lending a company money to finance its operations, growth or repayment of previous debts at a gain. Once you lend money to an organisation, you get periodic interest payments and a return of the bond’s face value on maturity. Notably, you can achieve a capital gain by selling the bond to another investor at a higher price, thereby making a profit.

Corporate bonds are generally perceived to be less risky than equities and have predictable returns. However, if you invest in a company without conducting a thorough fundamental and technical analysis, you risk losing all your money. Before investing in a corporate bond, conduct a thorough credit risk analysis, monitor interest rate movements and market conditions, and carefully read and understand the fine print of the debt agreement.

Preferred stocks

Preferred stocks are financial securities that represent ownership in a company. The shareholders get priority when it comes to payment of dividends and claim of assets in the event of liquidation. Preferred stockholders get a fixed dividend, thereby offering consistent and predictable income.

However, unlike common shares, you lack voting rights and cannot participate in major decisions regarding the company's operations. Before purchasing preference shares, evaluate the stability of dividend payments, the financial health and reputation of the company issuing the shares, market conditions, and the potential call risk.

Farming

Food is a basic need, and you can never go wrong with strategic farming. You may choose to farm on your existing land, lease land where you can grow cash-generating crops or engage in agribusiness operations.

Before engaging in farming, hire a professional who can guide you on the viability of the proposed crops. The specialist will assess the soil and environment and advise you on the best crops to plant. You may also choose to rear animals such as cows, goats, sheep, or whatever you are well-versed in.

The payback period for farming investments can vary widely based on the type of farming, market conditions, and weather patterns.

However, farming investments carry significant risks, such as climate variability, disease outbreaks, market price fluctuations, and high initial capital requirements. Before starting farming, do a proper market analysis to assess the demand for the crops you want to plant, check variable and fixed costs, evaluate the suitability of the land for the intended crops or livestock, and read through any regulatory requirements and potential subsidies from the national government.

Lastly, ensure you have a proper plan to manage risks such as drastic weather changes, market fluctuations and mitigation strategies.

In as much as each of the investment options will offer you medium-term risk and return, it is not always guaranteed that you will get your perceived return. Ensure that you do thorough research on each asset class and start immediately so that you do not lose value for your money. Further, evaluate your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon before making investment decisions. Always remember to be keen on diversification to benefit from the performance of various investments and not put all your eggs in one basket.

MPs turn spotlight on KRA over stalled Koru alcohol distillery,"A committee of the National Assembly has asked the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to explain delays in issuing a permit to a Japanese investor to commence operations of a newly set up alcohol distillery in Koru, Kisumu County.

The House's Finance and National Planning committee heard that KRA had failed to grant Yamaroku Limited, the makers of Koru Rum, licenses to operate its Sh7 million distillery.

Yu Yamakami, a Japanese investor, told the committee chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani that the distillery, which was set up in 2020, was yet to present Koru Rum in the market. Rum is a spirit made from sugarcane products such as molasses or fresh sugarcane juice (Agricole-style rum).

Ms Yu told MPs that there is only one legal framework for all distillers even though production sizes and processes are diverse.

The Japanese investor, who intends to set up Kenya’s first sugarcane Rum premium product for local and foreign markets, said the firm estimates to rake in more than Sh75 million turnover in a year. She said Koru Rum can produce 15,000 litres of Rum annually.

A tonne of sugarcane goes for Sh4,500, but if the same is distilled into Rum, it will fetch Sh250,000.

She said the KRA requirements to comply with the provision of Excise Duty Licenses will cost the company Sh25 million, and that the taxman requires distillers to install authorised flow meters that can be remotely monitored, whose estimated cost is Sh15 million.

They are also required to install tank capacity gauges or sensors that can be remotely monitored, which is a technical challenge to small distillers, besides mounting CCTV cameras that cost about Sh500 million.

Ms Yu said KRA requires the installation of automatic bottle filling and automatic labelling machines which cost approximately Sh8 million. Labour, transport, and other costs are estimated at Sh2 million.

“We are yet to start production despite investing Sh7 million in the distillery which has been ready for the past two years. We only produced a few litres for testing by the Kenya Bureau of Standards which has cleared our products for mass production,” Ms Yu, a co-founder and director of Yamaroku Limited said.

“The problem we are facing to allow us to roll out our Koru Rum is licensing by KRA. The current legal framework was developed for large-scale distilleries and compounders. It is not suitable for Micro Craft Distillers (MCDs).”

Appearing before the committee to make submissions on the Finance Bill, 2024, Ms Yu said the company had complied with all requirements and attained licenses from Kisumu County, the National Environment Management Authority (Nema), and the Kenya Bureau of Standards.

The Koru Rum Limited, she said is yet to receive a license from the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (Nacada) and the KRA Excise Duty License.

“We propose that you help us have a separate legal framework of regulation of Micro Craft Distillers,” Ms Yu said.

“We would like to propose the establishment of a separate legal framework for MCDs that allows for licensing (Excise Duty License) and operation separate from the big scale distillers.”

Mr Kimani, who chairs the committee demanded to know from the KRA Deputy Commissioner Maurice Oray why an investor who had set up a Sh7 million factory had not been granted licenses to operate.

“This is an investment that can give us a lot of revenue. The KRA should fast-track its licensing. Why should you deny an investment that can generate Sh75 million annually and the government gets taxes?” Mr Kimani asked.

“If alcohol is legal, we should not push small players out in favour of big boys. We need safe options. We have been told here by small brewers that they control 0.5 percent market share, while big players have 97 percent market share

Mr Oray, who sat through the public participation sessions, said the Finance Act, of 2023 gives remissions under Section 38 to those using agricultural products to produce alcoholic beverages.

“Spirits manufactured from agricultural products are subject to remission. But I will take up the case of Koru Rum and see how we can help them start production on its sugarcane Rum,” Mr Oray said.

Ecotourism key to natural heritage preservation in climate change war,"In recent months, rains have been ravaging Kenya, resulting in devastating floods that swept across the country, leaving an indelible mark on the country's landscape and people.

From the plains of the Maasai Mara to the streets of Nairobi, the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. This situation is not unique to Kenya; our neighbours in Tanzania and Burundi have faced a similar situation.

As we grapple with these environmental challenges, we must rethink our approach to travel and tourism in the region. Ecotourism, with its emphasis on sustainability and community benefits, offers a path that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change while preserving Kenya's rich natural heritage.

The recent floods are a stark reminder of our vulnerability to climate change. It has resulted in significant challenges for local and urban communities, disrupted wildlife habitats, and destroyed vital tourism infrastructure.

Experts warn that such extreme weather patterns are likely to become more common as global temperatures rise. This not only threatens Kenya's biodiversity but also its tourism industry, which is a significant component of the economy considering it was rated the best-performing sector in Kenya.

Ecotourism should be regarded as a critical solution to the challenges affecting tourism sites as a result of the adverse effects of climate change. By focusing on conservation, education, and community engagement, ecotourism ensures that tourism activities do not harm the environment but rather contribute to its preservation.

Take, for instance, the Maasai Mara, where many establishments were partially or fully submerged. This resulted in disruptions of tourism activities, displaced animals, and loss of revenue.

How can we address the issue? Tourism operators must integrate sustainable practices into their operations. Stakeholders need to take the lead in supporting and initiating conservation projects. We have an opportunity to implement green practices, such as minimising carbon footprints and supporting local conservation projects. We can encourage travellers to play a significant role in promoting sustainability by making conscious choices.

Sustainable tourism not only protects the environment but also brings substantial benefits to local communities. By embracing ecotourism, we can protect Kenya's natural treasures, support local communities, and build a resilient future.

State should clear debts to revitalise the media,"The media play a vital role as the watchdog of society, highlighting challenges and holding up examples to inspire success by individuals, public and private organisations, but they are also businesses. To be effective, they incur huge expenses, like operations and salaries.

It’s an open secret that the government is among the huge debtors to blame for the industry’s mounting financial woes. Media houses operate in a tough economic environment that could be substantially eased if the government cleared the Sh2.5 billion bills it owes them. Some are pretty old debts.

Faced by difficult choices, the first casualties are usually employees, as the organisations downsize to remain afloat. Well-trained and professional personnel, mostly young people, now stare at job losses as the government, which has refused to pay its debts, splashes billions of shillings on non-essential travel for its top officials. It is, indeed, shameful and disgraceful to spend Sh24 billion in nine months on travel alone.

Largely to blame for the ongoing layoffs and restructuring in the media industry are advertising debts owed by the national and county governments in the past 10 years.

The media promote investment to grow the economy for national development and prosperity. The government should be at the forefront of promoting the growth of businesses, including the media, not killing them. It should help businesses to survive and create and sustain jobs. One way is to come up with appropriate tax policies and avoid the punitive ones that are scaring away prospective investors as some enterprises prepare to exit. At this rate, the tax mandarins will find themselves with nowhere to get their pound of flesh from.

The media’s moniker “The Fourth Estate” is because they serve as a watchdog over the other three: The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The media inform, educate and entertain the public. Government policies are also best explained through mainstream media.

By prioritising the repayment of media debts to avert the collapse of this vital industry, the government will enable them to continue to effectively perform their critical role in society.

Miss not forest for the trees of revenue share,"The debate on revenue allocation and distribution is as old as Kenya. Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965, a blueprint for economic and social development, was the first government policy paper on revenue distribution and sharing.

Favouring areas with high economic potential with resources and economic patronage, it entrenched economic disparity and set the pace for the economic marginalisation of areas not well endowed in terms of economic resources. During the ‘Second Liberation’ struggle, the political elite from the economically marginalised regions emphasised equitable distribution of national resources.

The drafters of the 2010 Constitution, cognizant of the adverse effects of SP #10, were keen on public finance usage, allocation and distribution in the supreme law. Chapter 12 heavily dwells on that.

Article 201(b)(iii) states that the public finance system shall promote an equitable society and public expenditure promote equitable development, including by making special provisions for marginalised groups and areas. Art. 203 lays out factors to be considered in resource allocation—including economic disparities within and among counties, the need to remedy them and affirmative action in respect of disadvantaged areas and groups. The constitutional Equalisation Fund to “bring the quality of those services in those areas to the level generally enjoyed by the rest of the nation”.

The import of the constitutional provisions is threefold. One, the Constitution recognises SP #10’s bad precedent in the allocation and distribution of national resources. Two, it emphasises equality and affirmative action for true equality and economic emancipation. Three, it has clear guidelines and criteria for equity in resource sharing.

National unity

Art. 43 gives Kenyans the right to the highest attainable standard of health, accessible and adequate housing, freedom from hunger and access to clean and safe water, education and social security. But we have Wajir County, which is 59,000 square kilometres, compared to, say, Kiambu, 2,449 km sq.

As Art. 174 posits, the objects of devolution include fostering national unity, promoting socioeconomic development and ensuring equitable sharing of resources. National unity and cohesion very much hinges on the equitable sharing of resources.

Art. 73 expects state officers to demonstrate respect for the people, bring honour and dignity to the office and promote public confidence in the integrity of the office. They must be objective and impartial in decision-making, not influenced by nepotism, favouritism and other improper motives.

The “one man, one vote, one shilling” campaign is unconstitutional and a threat to national unity. Ethnic populism and the “Us versus Them” mantra is a retrogressive political misadventure. The state officers driving this call are in violation of Chapter 6 of the Constitution, on ethics and integrity. They must always seek common ground and act and work for the good of all the citizens and the entire nation, not their preferred community or enclave.

Avoid unrealistic taxes,"Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu has cautioned decision makers against decisions that will only worsen the dire economic situation and make it more difficult for the government to meet its obligations. She has called out the authorities over the apparently unrealistic and inadequate revenue planning and forecasting.

According to Ms Gathungu, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) is struggling to meet the National Treasury’s “over-ambitious” revenue targets. KRA has in the first nine months of this financial year collected Sh1.6 trillion, about 60 per cent of the Sh1.98 trillion revenue target. In a presentation to the Budget and Appropriations Committee (BAC) of the National Assembly, she sees the risk of increased borrowing as escalating the public debt, which stands at Sh11 trillion.

KRA would need to collect Sh1.04 trillion in the pretty short time remaining to meet the Sh2.62 trillion projected revenue from direct and indirect taxes and aid, for the current financial year. This is highly unlikely in the current economic situation. It is, of course, going to get much worse, coming at a time when the National Assembly has just approved the government’s Sh3.9 trillion Budget for the 2024/25 financial year. And this is against a revenue projection of Sh2.95 trillion.

The projected revenue includes Sh302 billion expected from the hugely unpopular proposed taxes in the Finance Bill 2024. These have not only sparked public uproar but also been dismissed as punitive even by finance experts and lawyers.

It is a substantive 12 per cent increase from the 2023/24 projection of Sh2.62 trillion. Questions have arisen over the government’s fiscal discipline amid missed revenue targets.

The Budget must be realistic to avoid overborrowing and levying punitive taxes. The people are suffering as the high taxes are not matched by quality public services in health, education and security. This calls for realistic measures.

House of the Dragon season 2: A return to the brutal world of dragons and politics,"When it comes to the Crème de la crème in television entertainment, Game of Thrones sits up there as one of the greats. As expected with any successful Hollywood show or movie, it spawned a spin-off after its conclusion: House of the Dragon. While House of the Dragon season 1 wasn't perfect, it was still able to deliver the politics, drama, and violence that true Game of Thrones fans craved.

With season 2 premiering on June 16, should we expect an improvement over season 1? Does it scratch that Game of Thrones itch? Let’s talk about it, spoiler-free of course.

House of the Dragon

Co-produced by George R.R. Martin and based on his book Fire & Blood, House of the Dragon is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and tells the story of House Targaryen. Following King Aegon II's coronation, Alicent and Rhaenyra cling to fading memories of their old friendship as their opposing factions gear up for civil war.

For season 2, Matt Smith returns as Daemon Targaryen, Emma D'Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen, and Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower, among others.

New cast members this season include BAFTA nominee Abubakar Salim as Alyn of Hull and Gayle Rankin as Alys Rivers.

What Works

Season 2 for Games of Thrones fans opens with an interesting title sequence that sets the tone for all the episodes.

This is the Game of Thrones universe, so you can expect the “moments”— the kind of scene that stay with you long after the show is over. Yes, the season has politics, family drama, and dragons, but it also reminds you of the brutal world it’s set in, with scenes people will talk about for a while.

This season feels more focused, picking up right after the events of season 1. There are fewer sporadic time jumps, and the pacing has been improved. Character arcs take beloved or hated characters in interesting directions, thanks to a story that leans heavily on political coalitions and alliances, building towards a conclusion that has been simmering since the previous season.

Visually, this season looks even more cinematic than the last. The cinematography is more deliberate, with wide shots that linger longer, showcasing the confidence the cinematographers and directors have in the set designers, costume designers, and special effects department. The score is familiar but well-executed, and the sound design effectively enhances storytelling, especially in one particular moment in the earlier episodes.

The performances, as expected, are remarkable. In fact, I found this season of House of the Dragon to be tonally balanced between season 1 and Game of Thrones.

Nitpicks

Like Game of Thrones, you can't just jump into this season without watching season 1. While there are enough epic, shocking and good moments to punctuate each episode, some viewers might find the pacing challenging.

Conclusion

The best way to summarise season 2 (without spoilers) is that this is the second round of a chess game that, while thrilling, demands your patience. Some of the players are licking their wounds after a loss, others just don't want to play, others, as expected in this universe, are just manipulators and will stop at nothing to get what they want and still in the same game innocent lives find themselves in the middle of the chaos with some ending up paying for it. At the end of it all like any other game what everyone wants is to just a win, it is all about power.

The show premieres on June 16, 2024, on HBO. Locally, it will be available on Showmax.

Need to include PWDs in climate change action,"The world is facing numerous life-threatening weather events. The fatalities from the recent mass floods and Cyclone Ialy have further raised the urgency to face head-on these challenges. Kenya has taken the lead role in the continent on climate action, and the inclusion of persons with disabilities (PWDs) in this endeavour is even more critical and deserves attention.

Developing nations like Kenya bear the brunt of climatic catastrophes. Socioeconomic barriers are more evident and prevalent to PWDs in the developing than developed countries. PWDs suffer the most during a natural disaster: They are up to four times more likely to lose their lives, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Unescap) data show. Six per cent of the people affected by these calamities acquire disabilities, increasing the burden to families and the economy.

Despite that, 75 per cent of PWDs feel excluded from humanitarian and rescue responses, as shown in a 2023 United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction report. Thus for PWDs the stakes are extremely high. Fortunately, social voices and advocacy efforts continue to raise awareness of the need for inclusive humanitarian and rescue efforts.

Climatic stability

Debate is on that what scientists call the Holocene period of global climatic stability ended 74 years ago and that we are in the Anthropocene Age of Man, where climatic changes are driven by human activity. Amid the fight for Earth’s survival, its time for deeper engagement, and for PWDs, who make up 16 per cent of the world population—not to be viewed as mere bystanders and victims but key and equal proponents and players—in line with Sustainable Development Goal13, on climate action.

PWDs are, unexpectedly, hugely marginalised in the social, political and economic aspects with them and their issues absent from climate change discourses. Despite suffering the heaviest burden of these weather extremities, they’re the least economically active; they, hence, have arguably the least carbon footprint. They are also not fully excluded from the general human contribution to global warming.

Kenya has implemented great reforms that work towards promoting independent living among PWDs. Importation of duty-free vehicles, while easing mobility for PWDs, contributes to the general population’s carbon footprint. This, coupled with industries that manufacture mobility devices, presents a strong case that the disability sector should not be exempted from green investments.

Climate Policy Initiative

The global climate policy organisation Climate Policy Initiative says mitigation takes the lion’s share of the $1.3 trillion climate financing, at $1.15 trillion (88 per cent), adaptation $63 million and dual benefits $51 million. This is a huge investment, capable of accommodating the entire disability sector.



Stakeholders should involve PWDs and their organisations in areas such as public awareness and policy development. PWD groups can be empowered on the nuances surrounding climate change discourses on regulations and laws, resulting in their enhanced engagement and participation on climate change issues. They should be funded to undertake sustainable projects and enterprises.

More measurable and evidence-based research on the socioeconomic toil of climate change on PWDs, specifically in Kenya, would spur the urgency to promote disability-inclusive climate action. That would serve as a call to action, and also narrow the psychological distance in the public that climate change is not an immediate concern.

We have one planet to call home, and it is the role of everyone, including PWDs, to keep it safe and habitable for us and the generations to come.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die; Another solid entry in the franchise,"Three decades after the debut of the original, the Bad Boys are back with their fourth explosive entry, and they haven't lost an ounce of their chemistry.

In an era where many franchises are struggling, it was impressive how this feels fresh yet its still the fourth installation of a 30-year-old franchise. This (in a strange way) is the kind of movie that you can't help but rave about to your friends, especially if you've been a longtime fan.



Synopsis

The world's favourite duo, Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) return with their signature blend of high-octane action and comedy. But this time, there's a twist: Miami's finest are on the run, turning the heat up like never before.

A Thrilling ride

Ride or Die is perhaps the best paced in the franchise yet. It maximises its one-hour fifty-five minutes runtime, delivering a tightly edited, seamless flow of events. The narrative and script are cleverly intertwined with previous movies, with callbacks to even Bad Boys 2.

Marcus (Martin Lawrence) stands out in this instalment and is given an entertaining character arc. The writers this time around skillfully subverted tropes and organically evolved the characters, making the film feel both fresh yet familiar.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence effortlessly slip back into their roles. Their chemistry is dominant in the film, and their energy is infectious, making them the heartbeat of the film. These two are so captivating that their dynamic alone is worth the watch.

For a true Bad Boys fan, a fan favourite from the second movie gets his redemption in this entry.

Visually, the film looks great. The cinematography this time around has a flare of creativity, with confident camera work that brings the action scenes to life in spectacular fashion. The familiar, iconic score ties everything together, reminding us of the franchise's roots while propelling it forward.

For the Die-Hard Fans

For those who've been with the franchise from the start, this movie is a rewarding experience. It's the perfect popcorn flick, delivering laughter, thrills, and the beloved characters we've grown to love.

Why the Riruta-Ngong commuter railway will be a game-changer,"Kenya's railway sector is on the cusp of significant development with the upcoming construction of the Riruta/Lenana to Ngong Metre Gauge Railway (MGR) line. This 12.5-kilometre addition aims at addressing a critical challenge: congestion on the main road artery connecting these Nairobi suburbs.

The increased capacity of the railway, with each train accommodating an additional 800 passengers during peak hours, will cater to a wider population. This not only benefits residents by easing their commute but also contributes to a more sustainable transport system, potentially reducing reliance on personal vehicles.

The Riruta - Ngong railway line, Phase 1 of the envisioned Riruta – Ngong – Kiserian – Ongata Rongai commuter link, is currently in the implementation stage. This line will run through 4 stations, namely; Riruta, Karen, Bulbul, and Ngong, taking off from the existing Metre Gauge line at Riruta (Lenana School area).

By providing a safe, comfortable, and convenient mode of transportation, the project not only enhances mobility but also reduces carbon emissions and promotes environmental sustainability.

But the benefits extend far beyond easing traffic congestion and environmental sustainability. By opening up the Ngong area for human habitation and commercial activities, the project stimulates economic growth and enhances the livelihoods of local communities.

The line is expected to catalyse the appreciation of land value along its route, attracting investments and fostering vibrant economic activity. Moreover, the reduced travel time and improved accessibility provided by the railway will spur the growth of several towns along the route, transforming them into hubs of commerce and industry.

Kenya Railways Corporation has tapped China Communication Construction Company to leverage its expertise in railway construction. The firm known for its track record in building railway lines in Kenya, brings invaluable experience to the table, ensuring the seamless execution of the project from conception to completion.

This project, like the ongoing modernisation of the national railway network, reflects a commitment to creating a strong foundation for economic growth and development.

Looking ahead, with subsequent phases planned to extend the line by 18 kilometres, the project will create a seamless connection within the NMR. This aligns perfectly with the broader vision for the Nairobi Railway City and the Eldoret Railway City, further solidifying a multi-modal transport network.

The efficient movement of people and goods within the region will not only boost economic activity but also foster a more integrated and vibrant metropolitan area.

The Riruta-Ngong MGR Commuter Rail project is more than just a new transportation route. It represents a vision for a more connected, efficient, and prosperous Nairobi Metropolitan Region.

By alleviating traffic congestion, unlocking economic potential, and providing a reliable and affordable transport solution, this project promises to improve the lives of residents and businesses alike.

"Mind pregnant, nursing workers","Discrimination against expectant and nursing mothers dates back to pre-civilisation. All struggle with it. Many have lost their jobs while some organisations refuse to employ them.

These two situations in the life of a woman come with varying challenges, which have to be accommodated at the workplace. Medically, pregnancy brings about a range of hormonal imbalances—from weird appetite demands to increased oxygen demand and unprovoked irritations.

Delivery ushers in more challenges to an employer, from the legal and human resource perspective. But any employer mindful of his organisation’s reputation must understand the effects of these physical changes and their psychological and mental implications to a woman.

This not only affects their productivity and concentration but may cause unexpected absenteeism. It calls for flexibility in working arrangements that may tilt the employment terms and conditions. It could be suicidal to contemplate disciplinary action.

The Employment Act envisaged that situation, prohibiting termination of women’s employment due to pregnancy. This is firmed up by Article 41 of the Constitution, on labour rights, which demands reasonable working conditions.

The Breastfeeding Mothers Bill has been pending in Parliament since 2017. Apart from making it mandatory for employers to provide a nursing area, it seeks flexible working arrangements for mothers. No expectant woman should faint at work for lack of a resting place. And no nursing mother should breastfeed or express in a toilet—which is not only unhygienic but also degrades a mother’s dignity. It minimises the privacy and confidence of a woman.

While some of these things may not be within the legal parameters, they form good practice policies and ethos for an organisation that cares about the welfare and wellbeing of its employees. This can form the basis for employee loyalty and act as a staff retention magnet.

Four police officers arrested in Sh2.2 million salary theft,"Four police officers have been arrested for allegedly stealing Sh2.2 million salary meant for casual workers at a private city school.

The officers are accused of stealing the money from a locked car parked outside Rophine International School in Utawala, Embakai Sub-County, in Nairobi on June 2.

Sergeant Antony Ndegwa, Corporal Daniel Lekakeny and Constable Antony Mwendwa are Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers from Kasarani, while Constable Simon Macharia is a police officer from Ruai Police Station.

They were arrested on June 6 at Kasarani Police Station car park and over Sh400,000 recovered from them. They were arrested alongside two others — Young Wakhisi and Lukas Magoiga Chacha.

The six suspects were arraigned before Milimani Senior Resident Magistrate Geoffrey Onsarigo.

Inspector Dominic Omondi, the lead investigator in the matter, requested for 14 days to conclude investigations.

The complainant is Mr Victor Owino, an accountant at Rophine International School, who on June 3 made a withdrawal of Sh2,361,000 at the Family Bank Utawala branch which was meant to pay workers.

The magistrate ordered that the suspects be detained at Kayole Police Station pending further orders from the court.

After withdrawing the money, Owino drove to the school located in Mihang'o in a Toyota Axio car with registration number KCE 535L, parked outside the school premises and entered the school with Sh161,000, leaving the rest of the money in the car which he had securely locked,

""Minutes later, Omondi went to fetch the remaining Sh2,200,000 but found it missing from the car."" Mr Onsarigo heard.

Mr Owino went to the Mihang'o police station and reported the matter.

When the school's CCTV cameras were retrieved, footage showed a silver saloon car with registration number KCR 595D and three occupants getting out of the car, entering Omondi's car and making off with the brown envelope containing the money.

At the time of arrest, a search was conducted and the suspects were found with a total of Sh468,000 which is believed to be part of the stolen money and the inventory of the same was signed.

Following the arrest of the four officers, Magoiga and Wakhisi were arrested at Ruai and Huruma respectively and no entries were made in the incident book but they were whisked away by officers from DCIO Kasarani.

Pressing for their arrest, Inspector Omondi told the court that the police needed 14 days to complete investigations.

The officer said they are yet to arrest other suspects who are at large and known to them, apart from recovering the motor vehicle used in the commission of the offence.

""We are also in hot pursuit to recover the remaining stolen amount and also identify the M-Pesa shops where the money was allegedly deposited to record statements,"" the officer said.

He also told the court that the recovered CCTV images are yet to be analysed by experts from the DCI headquarters for comparison and identification of the suspects.

The four respondents, who are police officers attached to the Investigation Branch, could interfere with the investigation as they have knowledge of the entire process and releasing them could jeopardise the investigation.

The court was also told that Wakhisi and Magoiga have no known whereabouts and it is therefore feared that they may go into hiding and delay the trial.

In his ruling, the magistrate ordered that the four police officers be detained at Kayole police station and the two civilians be detained at Ruai police station.

The court reserved its decision on whether to allow questioning for 14 days.

We pay you! President Ruto fires back at Uhuru Kenyatta,"President William Ruto-led government has denied claims by former President Uhuru Kenyatta that it was withholding benefits due to him.

It now says the disagreement had arisen from unrealistic demands by the retired Head of State to compel it to lease one of his homes for his own use against procurement laws.

Through Spokesman Isaac Mwaura the government Monday evening sought to set the record straight by saying, “The Office of the Third Retired President admits they have been provided with vehicles. We only differ on the number. The fact is that they have been provided with 14 vehicles.”

The statement said the vehicles are fuelled and maintained by the State House.

“They also alleged falsely that their fuel cards have been blocked. We, however, put it on record that the vehicles are fuelled through the State House Master Card. Our records show that several vehicles were fuelled as recently as May 15, 2024,” Mr Mwaura said adding that the vehicles are routinely maintained and serviced at State House.

“These services have been offered as recently as on April 5, May 7, May 8 and May 15, 2024.”

“The records are clear: The vehicles were bought in the years ranging between 2020, 2021 and 2022. They are, therefore, very befitting of the person of the third retired President.”

He said the vehicles in question include two Range Rover Autobiography, two Range Rover Sport, a Mercedes S600L, an Armoured Land Cruiser V8 and four Prados.

He said the contention arose after the Office of the Retired President sent a request for four vehicles whose cost is Sh140 million.

“They are Range Rover Vogue (First Edition) at KSh51.3 million, Mercedes Benz S500 worth Sh66.4 million, Toyota Land Cruiser ZX-VXRK6 worth KSh22.5 million and Toyota Fortuner at KSh10.6 million,” the government spokesman said.

About Mr Kenyatta’s office, he said in 2012/2013, the government purchased an office for him. This office is located in Nyari, Nairobi.

“This is the office the late President Mwai Kibaki used for nine years, between 2013 and 2022. It is, therefore, a suitable office for a retired President, any retired President. By rejecting this office and preferring that the government leases his own private home, the Third Retired President is inviting the government to violate procurement laws, regulations and procedures. It is an adventure that the government cannot engage in” he said.

Mr Mwaura further said staff at Mr Kenyatta’s disposal were on government payroll.

“The Presidential Retirement Benefits Act specifies that a former President should have 34 staff. Already, 33 are in office. The Act also specifies that staff who work in the Office of the Retired President must be public servants. On Mr George Kariuki and Ms Kanze Dena, their names have not been forwarded to the State House Comptroller by the retired President for processing,” he stated.

The statement further said the government diligently pays the salaries of the retired President, his staff and their allowances. State House also maintains and fuels the 14 vehicles, and facilitates all travels for the former President, both local and international.

“It is critical to point out that the Act provides that only four foreign trips should be fully paid for and for a maximum of 14 days. As for daily subsistence when on official duty, Public Service Commission and National Treasury regulations apply. The retired President's budget is under the State House Comptroller, who is the accounting officer of the State House, including the Office of the Retired President. The Comptroller originates the budget and defends it in Parliament.”

He added that there was no compelling obligation to seek concurrence on the budget with the Office of the Retired President.

"Tunisia up next for victorious Kenyan tennis girls Okutoyi, Wanjala","Kenya made light work of Mauritius in their opening match of Pool “B” of Billie Jean King Cup Africa Group III tournament yesterday at Nairobi Club, but face a tricky assignments against Tunisia on Tuesday, June 11, before playing Burundi on Wednesday, June 12.

Home player Cynthia Wanjala,19, came from behind in both sets to defeat 14-year-old Anna Chan of Mauritius 6-3, 6-1 in the first match, as African Games singles champion Angella Okutoyi,20, thrashed Tejaswini Jesoo,17, in the second match 6-0, 6-0 to hand Kenya a 2-0 lead. Alicia Owegi and Okutoyi’s twin sister, Roselida Asumwa, partnered in the doubles, which they won 6-3, 6-3.

“It was a good match against Chan although I made many mistakes in service, and I double-faulted a lot, especially in the first set,” Wanjala, who won silver at the African Games in Ghana in March alongside her partner Okutoyi, said.

For her part, Chan said: “It is my first time to compete in the Billie Jean King Cup. I’m happy with my performance, but I feel I could have done better. My opponent had the power which caused me a lot of problems.”

Mauritian coach, Bernard Thomas, was satisfied with the performance of Chan, who is the youngest player in the week-long competition.

Auburn University student Okutoyi (world no.491), who inspired Kenya to win bronze during last year’s edition at Billie Jean King Cup Africa Group III tournament, was happy to have finished the job early against Jesoo.

Aggressive

“My plan was to be aggressive from the word go, and I am happy it worked,” Okutoyi said, adding that qualification for the Paris 2024 Olympics was still on her mind, even as she strives to compete favourably in Billie Jean King Cup Africa Group III tournament

Jesoo said she was honoured to play African Games champion Okutoyi, but felt pressure throughout her match.

Kenya team took the clay courts in high spirits after Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba announced that the government had injected Sh14 million towards the success of the 12-nation event. Part of the money will go towards allowances of the team.

Before Monday, June 10th’s clash, Kenya and Mauritius had only faced off once, way back in April 2000 in Europe/Africa II Pool “A” in Estoril, Portugal when the tournament was called Fed Cup. The islanders triumphed 1-0 against Kenya who were represented by Esther Mbugua and Evelyn Otula.

In another Pool “B” match held on Monday, Sada Nahimana (world no.364) inspired Burundi to stun last year’s finalists Tunisia 2-1.

South Africa, who are back in Group III after being demoted from Europe/Africa Group II, humbled Namibia 3-0, as Zimbabwe welcomed newly-promoted Madagascar with a 3-0 thumping in Pool “A”.

Nigeria, who finished fourth last year and were the only side to beat Kenya in the last edition, trounced Uganda 3-0 in Pool “C”. Barakat Quadre defeated Patience Athieno 6-0, 6-1 and Divine Nweke saw off Winnie Birungi 6-0, 6-0 in singles. Ghana defeated Botswana 2-1.

In today’s fixture against Tunisia, Kenya will be hunting for revenge after their last meeting ended with a 3-0 win for the North Africans in April 2004 in Marsa, Malta in Europe/Africa III Play-offs.

WTA ranking points are not awarded for Billie Jean King Cup participation or victories. There is also no prize money.

Kenya has played in the Billie Jean King Cup for 15 years since making their debut in 1991. Okutoyi holds the national record for most total wins (11-5), most singles wins (7-3) and most doubles wins (4-2) at Billie Jean King Cup.

She is also the youngest ever player to represent Kenya at the annual event after she made her first appearance in 2018 aged 14 years, two months and 19 days.

Kenyan football fans in Malawi cheer Harambee Stars against Côte d'Ivoire,"Sixty Kenyan football fans have travelled to Lilongwe, Malawi, to cheer hosts Harambee Stars against Cote d’Ivoire in their fourth Group “F” match of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers at Bingu National Stadium on Tuesday.

The match will kick off at 4 pm Kenyan time on Tuesday, June 11.

Under their umbrella body - Kenya Football Fans Federation (Kefofa), 20 fans touched down at Kamuzu International Airport on Monday at around 9 am, while another 10 supporters are expected to arrive Tuesday morning.

The first batch of about 40 fans jetted into Malawi on Saturday.

Apart from paying for their tickets to Malawi, the supporters are also catering for their accommodation and meals.

“We love Harambee Stars and that is why we have sacrificed to travel to Malawi and give them support when they face the African champions. The 12th army is very important in any match, and we hope that our presence at the stadium will motivate them to perform well,” said Kefofa president Francis Liboyi.

International matches

Football Kenya Federation (FKF) was forced to seek an alternative venue for Kenya’s matches against Burundi (last Friday) and Cote d’Ivoire since no stadium in Kenya meets the standard for hosting international matches.

Due to logistical challenges, the fans failed to make it for the Stars’ match against Burundi at the same venue. The match ended 1-1.

Public Service Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria had promised to avail a 50-seater National Youth Service bus to ferry the fans to Lilongwe.

However, the plan was aborted at the eleventh due to bus mechanical challenges. From Nairobi to Lilongwe is 1991.3 kilometres and at least 31 hours’ drive.

Liboyi said the organisation has also sent a communication to Kenyans living in Malawi and the neighbouring countries to show up at Bingu National Stadium to cheer the team.

He said FKF will provide them with match tickets.

5000 Malawian Kwacha

Regular and VIP tickets will retail at 5000 Malawian Kwacha (about Sh368) and 20000 Malawian Kwacha (about Sh1474) respectively and will be available today outside the stadium.

Aware that a positive outcome for Kenya against the Elephants will need more than just performance on the pitch, Stars coach Engin Firat has rallied Malawians to throng the stadium and cheer Kenya.

“It is not a normal match because you don’t play against the African champions every day. I also hope that since Malawi is now our second home, the people from Malawi will help us to make a big impression in the match,” said Firat after their match against Burundi.

After three matches, Cote d'Ivoire tops the pool with nine points, three more than second-placed Gabon. Stars are third with four points, same as Burundi while Gambia are fifth with three points.

Bottom-placed Seychelles have no point.

Greenlight for Gikomba traders to sue Nairobi county in demolitions row,"Over 200 second-hand clothes (mitumba) traders in Gikomba have been allowed to file a fresh case challenging a decision by the Nairobi City County government to demolish their premises sitting on a 2-acre parcel of land valued at Sh1 billion to put up a fire station.

Justice Sammy Aswani Opande allowed the traders' lawyer Danstan Omari to file a fresh case seeking orders to stop the demolition of the stalls they have operated for the last 78 years.

He gave Omari two hours to file the substantive suit plus annextures of evidence which include licenses issued to the traders by the county government to operate.

The Judge heard that part of the evidence will be a video clip of President William Ruto who assured the traders they would not be evicted when he bought a shirt from a trader at Sh100 during the 2022 campaign period.

""The plight of the traders must be guarded jealously against the aggressors who have received licenses levy and now they have turned against the hopeless claimants,"" Mr Omari told the judge.

The court was further informed two traders have since died after their stalls were pulled down by the county government bulldozers two months ago.

The judge had earlier declined a plea by the traders to amend their earlier pleadings, which had omitted evidence to prove authority to operate in the area.

The traders comprising senior citizens aged between 50 and 80 years prayed for the court's intervention saying they had nowhere to go if the decision to kick them out of their business premises was not quashed.

The judge heard the traders have been operating on the premises since 1936.

The plea to file a fresh case was vehemently opposed by the county government lawyer Didda Halakhe who said the county government wanted to put up a fire station which is a project with public interest.

In his brief judgment, Justice Opande allowed the application by the traders to file a fresh case saying it has merit and not capricious.

The judge also waved an earlier order requiring the traders to pay costs of the earlier case which they had sought to amend saying they cannot be subjected to the double jeopardy of having their premises demolished and bearing costs of the suit.

"Parliament seeks urgent hearing of appeal on tax waivers to Japanese staff, firms","Parliament has written to the Court of Appeal over the delay in the hearing of a case challenging tax waivers granted to Japanese workers and companies.

In a letter to the deputy registrar of the appellate court, Parliament noted that a suspension of the judgment quashing Section 13 of the Income Tax Act for six months, will lapse this month yet the appeal has not been heard.

The High Court had in February last year declared the section unconstitutional, stating that then-Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani had no powers to grant the waiver.

“The orders are set to lapse on 19th June, 2024 yet the appeal has not been heard and determined, which may have the following ripple effects,” Andrew Emacar, who represents Parliament said in the letter.

Mr Emacar said one of two effects was Japanese consultants, companies and employees would be forced to pay income tax, thus breaching one of the conditions precedent to the grants extended to Kenya by Japan.

The other was that all applications for exemption or waiver of tax under the different statutes, which run into hundreds in a day, have to undergo public participation.

High Court judge Dennis Magare had ruled that exemption or waiver of tax can only be granted by Parliament through legislation and after the same is passed as a money bill as provided in the Constitution, and after public participation.

The judge also quashed Section 13(2) of the Income Tax Act, saying it is unconstitutional to the extent that it authorises income tax waivers through a notice in the gazette and for specified persons without regard to Article 210 of the Constitution.

Mr Yatani had exempted income tax for businesses, consultants and workers earned from 15 projects funded by Japanese companies valued at Sh328 billion.

In the appeal, Parliament and Treasury argued that following the quashing of the section, there is no legal framework for tax exemption, yet Article 210 of the Constitution envisages a scenario where one may be exempted from paying taxes.

The court heard that without the exemption, there is bound to be a level of apathy, especially among investors such as those under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) programme, who ventured into investment in the country following the waiver.

According to the Treasury, the exemptions were granted under a contract between the Kenyan and Japanese governments. Revising the terms and imposing taxes after they had already started the projects in Kenya, the Treasury notes would be changing the substantial terms of the contract between the two countries without negotiations, which might lead to stalling of ongoing projects.

Justices Daniel Musinga, Asike Makhandia and Mumbi Ngugi suspended the decision for six months from December 19, pending the hearing of the appeal.

“In the circumstances, it seems to us that given the far-reaching nature and enormity of the declarations and orders issued by the trial court, an order staying the coming into effect of the declarations of invalidity of the impugned Legal Notice and unconstitutionality of Section 13 of the Income Tax Act is merited,” the judges said.

"Shine on your way, Njambi Koikai","It is a testament to Njambi Koikai’s dedication to her craft that just three days to her death she was enroute to the next show in her popular Street Empire series.

“She was on her way to catch a flight to Kitale last Thursday when she fell ill and asked to be taken to the hospital,” recalls her long time DJ collaborator, Selector Technix.

The popular reggae MC was making the trip ahead of the show that was scheduled for last Sunday. As fate would have it, she died at Nairobi Hospital on Monday night following a long battle with endometriosis. These countrywide tours turned the 38-year-old into a much-loved personality and she used her influence to relentlessly call attention to the effects of the disease that had tormented her since teenage.

Njambi’s path to stardom started fortuitously. In April 2008, the Jamaican dancehall artist Turbulence who was in Kenya to headline what was dubbed The Peace Concert in the aftermath of the country’s post-election violence, was scheduled for a breakfast interview at Metro FM, then an all-reggae radio station, operated by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. Among the fans who were eagerly awaiting the star best known for the hit song “Real Warrior” was Daystar University student, Njambi Koikai, then interning in the KBC Newsroom. All she wanted was an opportunity to take a picture with her idol.

Loud scream

But when she approached the host of the show (the writer of this article) she was given a better offer: How about a chance to sit in the studio during the interview and ask some questions directly to Turbulence. She jumped at the chance, of course, and come the next day, she turned up bright and early at Broadcasting House, armed with her professional camera (this was pre-smartphone era). When the turbaned guest walked into the studio, Njambi let out a loud scream that appeared to startle Turbulence and his entourage. Her on-air reaction attracted the attention of listeners including Sabina Chege, then the Controller of Commercial Radio at KBC, who was tuned in while driving to work. “Who was the young girl screaming on air?” she enquired after the show. During the conversations that ensued, Njambi impressed the Metro FM management with her energy, and passion for reggae and within days she officially joined the breakfast team.

She didn’t possess the appearance of your typical reggae MC. Her favourite style at the time of neat skirts, starched blouses, along with her spectacles and teeth braces, gave her a rather nerdy look. But beneath the exterior was an ambitious, tough, street-wise operator. “When reggae was being played in River Road I would ask for the mic and they would say “no way you cannot.” And I was like “I was born in the ghetto and I will make it,” she later recounted.

After gaining on-air experience, she moved to present her own Drive Time show and the Club Metro at the weekend and adopted the stage name Fyah Mumma, from the Jamaican singer Queen Ifrica. “She brought an unparalleled energy to every session, always pushing boundaries and striving for excellence,” recalls her Metro FM colleague MC Junior Dread.

It was also at Metro FM that her long-time association with Selector Technix, who was then a member of the Black Supremacy sound system, started. “She enrolled at the Black Supremacy DJ Academy where I was the head trainer but even though she had the passion to be a DJ, she was taking too long to learn,” recalls Technix.

Reggae music

“So, I suggested ‘why don’t you forget this DJ thing and instead focus on being an MC. Thankfully she took my advice seriously and the rest is history.” Together they formed a DJ-MC partnership that has taken reggae music to every town across Kenya.

“We had an amazing chemistry since 2009 and even when she was going into hospital Njambi was always positive that she would bounce back.” When the KBC management took the decision to shut down Metro FM, Njambi was deeply aggrieved but she still picked herself up and returned to the Newsroom where she worked as a Newsreader on Channel One News before resigning from the public broadcaster on March 1, 2014.

She later worked for QFM and Trace Radio. Her battle with endometriosis was the motivation to become the face of the campaign on the importance of early detection and treatment of the disease “It is important for us to inform girls that period pain is not normal,” she said recounting her pain of 19 years and the more than 20 surgeries. She recorded a song called Rejection and Pain in 2016 to document that journey. Mary Njambi Koikai was born Jan 24, 1986 in Nairobi.

She graduated from Daystar University in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication (Electronic Media). At the same time, she studied French at Alliance Francaise where she met the members of Sauti Sol and became the group’s first Manager from 2006 to 2008. She was also an actress and theatre director with Heartstrings Ensemble from 2004 to 2009. In 2010 she enrolled at USIU-Africa for a Master’s degree in International Relations and French.

Njambi contested the Dagoretti South parliamentary seat in 2022 as an independent candidate. Following her death, tributes have also been paid by Jamaican reggae stars, including the legendary Burning Spear and Gramps Morgan of Morgan Heritage.

Uhuru Kenyatta: How William Ruto is frustrating me,"Kanze Dena speaks on Uhuru Kenyatta's retirement benefits

The silent war between former President Uhuru Kenyatta and his successor William Ruto, which dates back to Kenya's 2022 succession race, has burst into the open, with the former detailing his pains at the hands of the latter.

In a classic case of reversed roles, Mr Kenyatta— who was accused of mistreating and plotting to block Dr Ruto, then his deputy, from ascending to power— on Monday openly bewailed frustration and mistreatment by State House.

Through his spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo, Mr Kenyatta accused Dr Ruto of refusing to pay for his office and denying him budget for two consecutive financial years.

“In the financial year 2023/2024, which ends in a few weeks, the budget allocation to this office was 503 million shillings. The year is ending without the office having any access to this allocation. The total amount for the two years that we have not had access to is approximately 1 billion Kenya shillings,” Mrs Mararo said.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the disbursements, she said Mr Kenyatta was “waiting with bated breath” to see if the Sh579 million allocated to him will be honoured.

“The quagmire that the office is in is that the office cannot substantiate what has been used and where the monies have been used since several requests and attempts to get budget returns from the accounting officer (at State House) have fallen on deaf ears,” she said.

She noted that whereas salaries and medical insurance had been paid, no other monies spent could be accounted for by the office of the former president.

Speaking at the Uhuru Kenyatta Institute in Nairobi, where Mr Kenyatta puts up in a private office he pays for, Mrs Mararo revealed that her boss had not received new vehicles as stipulated in the Presidential Retirement Benefits Act.

The former commander-in-chief, she said, is forced to move around using the old transition fleet that he used while handing over power— vehicles that State House refused to fuel.

“The office would like this to go on record that after transition, a conversation on the purchase of vehicles as required by law commenced between the two offices,” she said.

“Identification of the vehicles was done, down to the color of the said vehicle, then the conversation froze. To date, no discussions have been revived. We do not know if the cars were purchased or not.”

Mr Kenyatta, she noted, also takes great exception to the mode of communication that State House has adopted to address his office.

“State House chooses a verbal form of communication on official issues or chooses not to respond to correspondence generated by this office. This includes the requisitions for fuel and maintenance, office operations and facilitation, pending renewal of contracts and budget returns,” she said.

She said there is need for written communication to maintain transparency and order.

The former Head of State also decried alleged harassment of his staff by State House operatives who make calls at night.

It also emerged that Mr Kenyatta has been paying the salaries of two of his senior officers— Mrs Mararo, Secretary of Communication, and Mr George Kariuki, Secretary of Administration — after State House refused to renew their contracts.

The two have not drawn government salaries since Mr Kenyatta handed over power Dr Ruto after he defeated the former president’s preferred successor Raila Odinga.

"JSS teachers sacked, two days after they called off strike","Thousands of Junior School teachers on contract who were on the just concluded strike, have been sacked, two days after they ended their go-slow.

According to copies of the termination letters issued to the teachers on Monday, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) cited professional misconduct as the reason for the young tutors' termination.

The number of sacked teachers was not immediately established.

Last month, the commission issued ‘show cause’ letters to 7,357 teachers on the controversial ‘internship’ programme.

The termination letters were dated June 6, 2024, but were distributed to head teachers on Monday, June 10.

“Reference is made to the show cause letter in which you were accorded an opportunity to explain the reasons why your engagement as an intern should not be terminated on account of professional misconduct.

""The commission has carefully considered your response and found the same to be unsatisfactory,” reads one of the letters.

Another one reads: “The commission has noted that you failed and/or ignored to provide any reason for your absence from duty as required vide the afore-mentioned letter. In view of the above, the commission has decided to terminate your internship with effect from June 6, 2024.”

Among those who have received dismissal letters include Omari Omari, the spokesperson of the teachers' lobby that has been agitating for the employment of the teachers on permanent terms.

“I was given my letter today after I reported to school (Karen C Primary in Lang’ata sub-County). We went to the regional director to seek audience but were informed that the termination is final since they regard us as interns,” he told Nation.

Why Kenya has lost its lucrative exports market share,"Kenya’s failure to diversify the goods it sells abroad has hit its performance in key lucrative export markets, leaving it trailing its regional peers Uganda and Tanzania, an analysis by the World Bank reveals.

In its latest Kenya Economic Update, the World Bank notes that Kenya has mainly relied on the shipment of a fixed basket of products — a position that has seen it lose market share in the key European Union (EU) bloc.

Moreover, the analysis pointed out, that Kenya continues to bring into the international market products that are produced by many other countries, which has denied it an opportunity to enjoy huge margins when pricing.

“Kenya’s exports have significantly underperformed, both in nominal and in real terms. The approximate cause for this is that the country has diversified little during the last few years,” said the World Bank.

Read: Exporters feel heat of EU retailers airfreight ‘ban’

The global lender cited the 2023 Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity, a data visualisation tool, which showed that as of 2021 Kenya ranked 46 out of 133 countries in terms of the diversity of its export basket, moving down its place in the ranking by nine positions in the past 15 years.

In the review period, Kenya added 14 new products to its export basket, 41 less than neighbouring countries like Uganda, which added 20, Tanzania (22) and Ethiopia (25).

“Moreover, the country has lost competitiveness in markets that it already exported to. For example, Kenya has steadily lost market share in the EU—its main market for agricultural exports. Exports to the EU rely on the same products (flowers, coffee, tea, avocados, green beans) than two decades ago,” added the report.

“This marked decline contrasts sharply with other comparator countries like Peru and Morocco−which have considerably increased their export product ranges in the EU during the same period. Peru, for instance, tripled the number of exports to the EU above $10 million from 11 to 37, while Morocco almost doubled them from 25 to 48 during the same period.”

The country’s exports of goods and services as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP), or the size of the economy, fell from 21.5 percent in 2011 to a low of 9.6 percent in 2020, pointing to erosion in competitiveness.

One of the reasons for Kenya’s underperformance is its failure to diversify its export products, which are mostly agricultural products, including flowers, tea, coffee, beans, and avocado.

Read: Unpopular mango varieties lock out Kenya from EU

Except for a brief period when Kenya exported sizable quantities of titanium, Kenya’s exports have mostly been raw agricultural produce. Attempts to add value to these products, including fruits, coffee, and tea, have barely been successful.

Moreover, there has been little, if any, sophistication of Kenya’s exports in the last 10 years, with the country’s export basket primarily composed of low-complexity products.

Because Kenya’s export basket has not expanded its level of diversification and sophistication through the years, the country has fallen six positions during the period in the economic complexity index (ECI). Currently, Kenya ranks 80 out of 133 countries in complexity.

“Exports are not particularly unique, and thus the fact that Kenya’s export products are produced by many other countries reduces firms’ profit margins, making it harder for them to compete,” added the World Bank report.

Indeed, Kenya’s export sector exhibits an unstable pattern at the firm level, with a high rate of firms entering and exiting the export market annually. Post-2012, the landscape has seen a significant reduction in long-term exporters, coupled with a rise in single-year exporters, according to the World Bank.

“Nearly half of all exporters (44.7 percent) are now on an average year, not having exported in the previous year. These new exporters, although plentiful, have a minimal share in total exports, and their longevity is limited, with only 42 percent surviving beyond their first year,” added the World Bank.

The World Bank noted that while Kenya has made inroads in the East African bloc, it still struggles to compete outside those markets.

“More than three-quarters of manufacturing exports are destined to the East Africa Community (EAC) members or landlocked neighbouring countries for which Kenya serves as a transit point.”

Read: 34 plant shutdowns reveal Kenya manufacturing woes

And even then, the reason Kenya is doing well in the EAC is goods it exports to the EAC —mainly final products such as steel, pharmaceuticals, and processed food— attract the highest common external tariff (CET) rate of 25 percent when they come from outside of the EAC. Kenya exports its goods to neighbouring countries duty-free.

“However, as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) progressively reduces tariffs, Kenya will need to boost the sector’s trade integration and competitiveness to rely less on the CET.”

The underperformance in exports has also had an impact on Kenya’s fiscal health as external debt services costs have risen faster than export earnings. Ordinarily, exports should be the main source of foreign exchange (forex) earnings.

These forex earnings should then be used to repay external loans denominated in foreign currencies including dollars.

"I earn Sh27,000 as an accountant and spend Sh26,700; should I go back to college and study nursing?","My name is Carol. I am 29 and single. I work as an accountant, earning Sh27,000. My rent is Sh3,000, water and electricity,  Sh1,200, food and a supplementary budget for emergencies, Sh10,000, personal care Sh10,000, and transport Sh2,500.

I have a debt of Sh120,000 that I took to pay for my sibling’s vocational college fees. This debt is in default.

I am not progressing in my career and I think this is because of AI. I am considering quitting and changing to nursing. I plan to go back to my parents and then go to nursing school, but I don’t know how to raise the fees, how long this would take, and if this is the right thing to do. Am I too old? How do I manage my money so I can achieve all this?

Chacha Nyaigoti Bichang’a, a financial coach at Chachanomics Consulting Firm and the author of Mastering Your Money advises:

Your total expenditure is Sh26,700 leaving you with a negligible balance of Sh300. This implies that you are living from hand to mouth with a net salary of Sh27,000. That is why your debt of Sh120,000 is in default because you cannot repay it with your exhausted salary. To address your financial challenges, you need to do the following:.

Review your financial situation. Re-examine how you spend your salary and identify what you can do to cut down on unnecessary expenditures. For example, it is not clear how much exactly you spend on food and the supplementary budget for emergencies. The figure of Sh10,000 is perhaps a general estimate. Monitor your expenses on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to determine where every shilling goes. Cut down your expenditure on personal care, which consumes Sh10,000 (translating to 37 per cent of your salary). You can save more than Sh5,000 a month. You can do hair that can last at least two months, buy cosmetics and other adornments in bulk once in three months and forgo other unnecessary related expenses.

Use the 50/30/20 budgeting guide. Spend 50 percent (Sh13,500) on necessary expenses like rent, electricity, food, and transport, then spend 30 percent (Sh8,100) on emergencies and investments. Lastly, spend 20 per cent (Sh5,400) on wants or unnecessary expenses that do not sustain your life on a day-to-day basis, such as personal care, fashion and trends. But because you have a huge unpaid debt, you can forgo this and concentrate on repaying the loan.

Have a debt repayment strategy. Your unpaid debt of Sh120,000 requires you to make adjustments to your budget and squeeze on discretionary expenses or you want to get some money to start repaying the debt. You can also channel the money meant for saving towards clearing the debt first then embark on a robust saving and investment scheme. Set aside Sh10,000 every month to repay the loan and in 12 months you will have cleared it. You should know the difference between a good debt and a bad debt. A good debt is able to repay itself but a bad one is financed from your salary and a different source of income. It is not clear how much interest is charged for the loan you took to pay your sibling’s vocational college fees. The debt itself is a liability. Make sure you save some money in an interest-earning money market fund for such expenses.

Start a side hustle. To supplement your small income, scan your immediate environment and identify a problem that you can solve by providing an essential service. Use your accounting skills to do part-time jobs like auditing for businesses, organisations and institutions at a modest fee. Register an audit or accounting firm that offers accounting services. You can also do part-time teaching during your free time in various institutions that offer accounting courses and earn extra money that can enable you to repay your debt, save and invest more.

Set SMARTER financial goals. Your goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. In terms of time, the goals should range from short-term (three to 12 months) to medium-term (two to five years) and long-term (five years and above). One of the short-term goals includes repaying the debt in one year. You can decide to save Sh5,000 in a money market fund and Sh5,000 in a Sacco in two years once you have cleared the outstanding debt. A long-term goal can be to take a Sacco loan in five years and invest in real estate.

You are still young and have plenty of time to plan your finances wisely. Strive to acquire financial literacy by enrolling in a personal financial coaching programme, and hiring the services of a financial coach and mentor who can walk along with you to accomplish your financial plans. Remember, you cannot solve the same financial problem with the same mind that created it. You need a different software, mental reprogramming and reconditioning for you to get the desired outcomes.

On your quest to change professions, you should be guided by your qualifications and whether nursing is something you are passionate about. Age is not a major factor as you are still young. In fact, if you were to enrol for a nursing diploma in March 2025, you could be a qualified nurse by age 32. The upside to this is that you will have two careers, one that you can practice full-time (nursing) and one that you can use as a side hustle (accounting). Financial implications will be there as nursing is a full-time course that might require you to take a lengthy sabbatical from work, and probably move back in with your parents, not to mention the fees and related study costs that might be as high as around Sh450,000 at the end of the course.

Kajiado cleric sues car firm for Sh50m in defamation case,"A Kajiado-based cleric, Bishop Tinga Ole Turere of the Global Cathedral Church, has moved to court seeking Sh50 million in compensation from CarMax East Africa Ltd allegedly for defamation.

In a case filed at the Milimani Law Courts, Bishop Turere had sought orders against the car dealer, its agents or servants from repossessing, transferring, interfering or advertising by way of sale of public auction or private treaty or otherwise disposing of the motor vehicle, whose registration number is KCV 550B.

The court had issued an order on May 16 restraining the company “whether by themselves, their agents, their employees and/or servants from sharing the plaintiff’s personal data, information and/or defamatory messages on a public or private platform, social media or otherwise” pending the hearing and determination of the case.

According to documents filed in court by Bishop Turere’s lawyer, Mr Mathew Muoki, the cleric wants the car dealer to admit liability, retract the defamatory social media posts and pay him Sh50 million in damages.

""The words in the impugned messages and social media posts are defamatory of our client who is a highly respected church leader. The message was intended to portray our client as a deceitful, dishonest and unethical person,"" reads part of the demand letter from the plaintiffs' lawyer Mathew Muoki.

In a reply to the demand letter written by James Njeri & Co Advocates on June 7, 2024, on behalf of CarMax East Africa Limited to Mathew Muoki Advocates, the law firm argued that Bishop Turere had not been defamed by asking him to pay the outstanding sums for the vehicle he is currently using.

Furthermore, on 30 May 2024, Bishop Turere escalated the matter to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner.

The bone of contention is a Sh6.5 million car that Bishop Turere bought from CarMax on December 28, 2019. While Bishop Turere insists he owes the company Sh1,302,500 payable in monthly instalments of Sh100,000, CarMax East Africa Ltd  says the debt is Sh1,543,000.

According to the agreement seen by the Nation, Bishop Tinga was to pay Sh3,250,000 and the balance of Sh3,250,000 was to be financed by the bank.

Re-negotiations of the repayment plan have been reviewed by both parties separately with Bishop Ole Tinga pledging his land LR No Kajiado/Kaputiei North /20602 on 27 October 2020 as collateral.

Why men don’t marry the woman they struggle with,"If everything goes according to plan, I should be getting married in a few years. Nataka mniombee. This is not something I have thought about actively, but it shall be pressed upon me, much like taxes, much like my gender.

Prevailing conditions make it untenable for me to live alone. I hosted a shindig at my place this weekend, and I kid you not, this was the first time my refrigerator was this full. I didn’t even know that my oven has a timer and that you can use electric plates to make tolerable, if not sufferable ugali. Someone’s daughters scrubbed my kitchen sink so clean, I have postponed buying a mirror.

Apparently, it’s public knowledge that lemon is not just a fruit but also a cleaning agent. And that you can use your pillow not just for your head, but also your tummy to elevate the nini during nini—but this is a family newspaper and my mother expects me in church this Sunday and you know what I mean.

How do women know all this stuff? These are not the reasons I will get married but the reasons I will stay married.

Also Read: Mantalk: Why do good men cheat?

Since campus, I have what? One close friend who got married, but that marriage lasted as long as the lifespan of a Gengetone’s rapper music career, so that’s probably not a good example.

The rest have just taken custody of people’s daughters, promising one day to put a ring on it, but that hasn’t stopped them from milking the cow, appropriating resources, and buying extra pillows to elevate the nini during nini, if you catch my drift. I don’t think this says good things about me.

I have a theory that these men are unlikely to end up marrying these women because said women remind them of their struggles.

They started together in the trenches, from a bedsitter in Roysambu, through the odd jobs in Githurai, through the trying traffic jams of Thika Road, but God has been good and now they crossed over from that side of Tom Mboya Street to this side of Moi Avenue, moving from Kanairo to NBO.

Also Read: Why a woman will rarely forget when a man cheats

Things are looking up. But every time the man turns, and looks at his woman, he sees the struggle. Aluta continua. Which is why he won’t marry her. She is a reminder of where he has come from, not necessarily where he is going.

Hear me out: The woman you struggle with is not automatically the one you thrive with. The scars of the struggle condemn her – she is too masculine, a tad aggressive, extra chirpy. Because as every man knows, to dig yourself out of the trenches, you become the shovel itself. In the trenches, there is no time for feelings. Hapa kazi tu. Please do not pretend to not know what I am talking about.

See, when you finally make it out of the hood, sometimes, the woman fails to lose these aggressive qualities.

They are ingrained in her, battle scars. But men want a girly woman, not a softer man. Feminine, not feminist.

A trophy, a symbol that you made it, like the President with his friendly jet. I mean, look at how the President switched up on us. He campaigned on a hustler’s narrative, and made his bones through sheer shrewdness, but when he got what he wanted, he moved to his glitzy friends, those who can “pay” for his jet. Campaigning, cajoling, convincing…it was all pure theatre, a rugged and risky masculine burlesque.

If I am correct about this, which I am, then the explanation for men not marrying the women they struggle with is the same as for women marrying successful men.

The pretty girl is a representation of where the man can go. And for the girl? Who doesn’t know that a woman’s greatest perfume is the fragrance of her man’s success? I am a man; I know these things. When the alligator comes out of the water and tells you the crocodile is sick, do you doubt him?

Granted, some people marry their childhood sweethearts. I know several. But they are the exceptions that prove the rule. Now that you made it, now that life is good, we want a bad bi---, a “loved one”, the kind of girl who says goodbye in the rain, this is the law of reciprocity. What goes up, must come down.

That’s why you will see men with a 20-something pretty young thing with a stomach flatter than my mother’s chopping board, those girls who speak with a vocal fry and can pull off any accent; the ones who think Roysambu sounds like the name of a rare armpit disease. (Apropos, there is nothing good that comes from Roysambu—there are no baddies in Roysambu, just girls with bad manners.)

Is this why marriage works? Maybe not. But it’s another reason it’s an attractive prospect, that there can still be a day for the underdog, that the hero gets the girl in the end. It’s coda to all the hours you put in the work, and this is relationship champagne over here. It sounds offensive, rude even, but the truth is an axe that breaks the mind free. The girl you struggle with reminds you of where you’ve come from, the girl you thrive with reminds you of where you could go.

This is the bottomless gulf between what we publicly admire and secretly desire, between what we say we want and what we actually want, between the people we marry and the people we love. So that time when she comes from Turkey with more pillows, and that night when her body still looks slim and her nyash’s still nyashing and girlish and she puts the pillow from Turkey under her tum-my to elevate the nini during nini—you feel ripe with tenderness and rich with love and feel 28 again and thank God you worked this hard.

At that moment you wife this girl, this trophy that reminds you of where you could go, this symbol of success, because this is the only reason most men do not marry the girls they struggle with.

We still date in marriage: Fun things we do to keep our love alive,"They say it is far better to revel in solitude than to yearn for companionship. Yet there is always a persistent, innate longing for a partner, a life companion, or a soulmate.

As Joseph Roux said, isolation kills.

Life can be hard, laden with stress, disappointment, and frustration. Add an uncaring partner to the mix, and it becomes unbearable.

Marriage, especially when you find the right partner, one who makes you laugh, brings out the best in you, and knows your love language — can soften any blows or curveballs that life throws at you.

Read: Planning to get married? Ask each other these questions first

In the honeymoon phase of any relationship, it is easy to find fun activities to do together. But as time goes by, neglect may creep in and loosen your bond with your partner.

The daily struggle to stay on top of your career, be a good parent to your children, and pay all your bills can hurt any relationship.

For this reason, marriage counsellors advise couples to always find ways of strengthening their bond amid the hustle and bustle of life.

This week, four couples share the routines and activities that have kept their marriages alive and strengthened their bond over the years.

Joshua Bosire and Ruth Mwende

Joshua and Ruth have been married for a year. The two work at the same company, Jayb Events, as CEO and director.

Couples who work together often take work home, and their professional life may overshadow their love life.

“We noticed that we had prioritised our company more than our relationship. My wife would see me more as a business partner than a marriage companion. That’s when we decided to create fun activities that we could do together,” Joshua says.

They set aside time to watch movies together, go on adventurous road trips and adrenaline-pumping like zip-lining.

They have set aside specific days exclusively for bonding. They soon realised they both had a passion for creative writing.

“I realised that Ruth loves writing. In our company, we offer photography and videography services, and I noticed that my wife was so creative. She would make funny and interesting captions and some short intriguing comments to accompany the photos. Our clients were so impressed,” he says.

Recognising that spontaneity and surprises make relationships less monotonous, Joshua and Ruth embraced impromptu gestures of love.

“We have date nights where we just enjoy each other’s company. Every weekend, we go for either dinner or lunch. A memorable experience was when we tried the Truth or Dare game. It made us get to know more about each other and also realise each other’s preferences and fantasies,” Joshua says.

Naomi Shinda

Naomi is a lecturer, a mother and a wife. She has been married for three years now.

“When our first child came into our lives, we realised the importance of carving out time to keep our relationship vibrant and alive. To make our marriage work, we decided to create some fun activities that we do together,” she says.

We play video games, binge-watch TV shows, dance, and go on road trips.

“We realised that when we do such fun activities together, we stay more connected,” she says.

Amid their busy schedules, the two prioritise quality time.

“We set aside a specific time for ourselves every day. Whether it is unwinding together after a long day of work or simply enjoying each other’s company, we make it a point to be present and fully engaged with each other.”

However, Naomi reveals that balancing work, personal commitments, and spending time with her husband requires discipline and sticking to a strict schedule. Discovering new hobbies together has proven to be a delightful journey for the two.

From cheering on their favourite football teams to one partner learning how to drive under the patient guidance of the other, these shared experiences have strengthened their bond.

Additionally, Naomi says that spontaneity and surprises play a crucial role in keeping their relationship dynamic.

“He surprises me with gifts, and I also reciprocate. If we have time and money, we go on evening dates just to relax.”

The two have also established traditions that they both cherish, like praying together every evening, hugging and kissing before leaving the house, and coming home with a small gift to show appreciation.

“These rituals serve as reminders of our love and commitment to each other.”

She says that date nights are non-negotiable for them, whether it is a cosy night in, or a romantic dinner out.

“One memorable experience that brought us closer was when I taught my husband how to make ugali, a traditional Kenyan dish. It was a hilarious yet heartwarming moment that reminded us of the importance of learning and growing together, both in the kitchen and in life.”

Wycliffe Ngoti and Lydia Ngoti

A campaign period in 2020 almost broke the relationship that Wycliffe and Lydia had built for more than 10 years.

Wycliffe is a consultant in the hospitality industry, while Lydia is a nurse.

Lydia says that her husband engaged in vigorous campaigns in Nairobi’s Kibera by-elections in 2020 after the death of the then Member of Parliament, Ken Okoth.

“He was so busy that we had no time together. This is when we realised that there was a need for us to come up with fun activities to reconnect.”

“We started singing in the church choir and going for choir competitions inside and outside our parish,” she says.

The duo adds that they always create time for each other at the end of each month.

“We are strict with our designated time, which we spend doing various activities at home. Basically, there is no technique, although each activity is assigned its own time.”

Wycliffe Ngoti and Lydia Ngoti built their bond by conducting door-to-door evangelism.

The couple agrees that finding a neutral, fun activity for them is a big challenge.

“We can decide to do my husband’s way this time, next time we do things my way.”

Apart from singing in the choir, the two also enjoy travelling.

“We have made it a tradition to travel to the village at the end of the year unless we have some unforeseen circumstances that make us go upcountry in the course of the year. The change of environment alone strengthens our bond,” Wycliffe says.

Going on holidays to be intimate away from their normal home environment makes things fresh and exciting.

What spiced things up in their marriage was when they were chosen as the best couple by a youth couple in their church.

“This really brought us together and motivated us as a couple.”

*Anne

Anne and her partner have cultivated a deeply intimate routine that enriches their relationship daily. Each morning, they deliberately rise an hour earlier and use the quiet time in bed to share their dreams, concerns, and plans for the day.

These moments help them connect, solidify their bond, and set a positive tone for the day. Their intimacy extends beyond the morning hours, encompassing small yet meaningful rituals that punctuate their daily lives.

“After spending time in bed, we shower together. This is a fun activity that we really value. Those 15 minutes in the bathroom may seem mundane to some, but for us, they are sacred. It is where we shed the stresses of the day, where we open up about our triumphs and challenges, and where we strengthen our connection, one drop of water at a time.”

Evenings become the canvas upon which their bond truly flourishes. Whether cooking together, canoodling while watching a movie, or on a spontaneous adventure, each moment becomes an opportunity to deepen their connection.

They avoid going to clubs and going on drinking sprees and instead prefer engaging in activities that cement their bond.

In the digital age, staying connected takes on new dimensions for Ann and her partner. They use platforms like Instagram to find adventures they can share, and exchange posts of places to visit, and activities to try.

“Yet, amid our quest for unity, we understand the importance of individuality. We give each other space to pursue our own interests, nurture our own friendships, and maintain a sense of self within the confines of our relationship. It is this balance of togetherness and autonomy that keeps our love alive and thriving, even in the busiest of times.”

Beatrice Cornel and Cornel Odhiambo

Beatrice Cornel, a 30-year-old behavioural researcher, and her husband, Cornel Odhiambo, have been happily married for five years.Their relationship is deeply rooted in their faith, with God at the centre of their lives.

Together, they engage in various spiritual activities, including prayer, attending church, participating in door-to-door evangelism, and volunteering at charitable events.

For them, these activities are not just about serving others; they are opportunities to strengthen their bond as they navigate their spiritual journey together.

However, for fun, Beatrice says that they gossip.

“It is our thing. We talk about anything and everything, no holds barred, as long as nobody’s feelings get hurt.

It is liberating, I tell you. And when life gets so busy, we keep the communication lines open. Calls, texts, WhatsApp messages…whatever it takes to stay connected and updated on each other’s day.”

Beatrice Cornel and Cornel Odhiambo watch movies together every weekend and love to have hilarious conversations.

Dinner holds a special significance for Beatrice and Cornel. It provides the perfect time to come together, share a meal, and reinforce their love for one another.

“Lately, I have been making an effort to come home early just so we can keep those conversations going.

From jokes to serious stuff, we talk about it all. It is something I never thought I would enjoy so much, but here I am, loving every minute of it.”

Spontaneity is a key element of their relationship, with surprises and impromptu date nights keeping the romance alive.

Despite having different interests, they communicate openly, find common ground, and make compromises to ensure their relationship thrives while staying true to themselves.

They have also established rituals, such as spontaneous outings, to maintain a sense of connection and excitement in their relationship.

Travelling is a shared passion and fun activity for them, and they love exploring new places and trying new things as a couple.

“One of our favourites moments was on Valentine’s Day last year. We did not plan to do anything, we just went with the flow and ended up at Taidy’s Suites in Nakuru for a magical evening. It is moments like those that remind us why we fell in love in the first place. Our love knows no bounds. It is not about schedules or timetables; it is about living and loving in the moment.”

"I earn Sh27,000 and spend Sh26,700; should I change careers?","My name is Carol. I am 29 and single. I work as an accountant earning Sh27,000. My rent is Sh3,000, water and electricity Sh1,200, food and a supplementary budget for emergencies Sh10,000, personal care Sh10,000, transport Sh2,500.

I have a debt of Sh120,000 that I took to pay for my sibling’s vocational college fees. This debt is in default. I am not progressing in my career and I think this is because of AI.

I am considering quitting and changing to nursing. My plan is to go back to my parents and then go to nursing school, but I don’t know how to raise the fees, how long this would take, and if this is the right thing to do.

Am I too old? How do I manage my money so I can achieve all this?

Chacha Nyaigoti Bichang’a - a financial coach at Chachanomics Consulting Firm and the author of Mastering Your Money

Your total expenditure is Sh26,700 leaving you with a negligible balance of Sh300. This implies that you are living from hand to mouth with a net salary of Sh27,000.

That is why your debt of Sh120,000 is in default because you cannot repay it with your exhausted salary. To address your financial challenges, you need to do the following:

Review your financial situation. Re-examine how you spend your salary and identify what you can do to cut down on unnecessary expenditures.

For example, it is not clear how much exactly you spend on food and the supplementary budget for emergencies. The figure of Sh10,000 is perhaps a general estimate.

Monitor your expenses on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to determine where every shilling goes. Cut down your expenditure on personal care which consumes Sh10,000 (translating to 37 per cent of your salary).

You can save more than Sh5,000 a month. You can do hair that can last at least two months, buy cosmetics and other adornments in bulk once in three months and forgo other unnecessary related expenses.

Use the 50/30/20 budgeting guide. Spend 50 per cent (Sh13,500) on necessary expenses like rent, electricity, food, transport, then spend 30 per cent (Sh8,100) on emergencies and investment.

Lastly, spend 20 per cent (Sh5,400) on wants or unnecessary expenses that do not sustain your life on a day-to-day basis such as personal care, fashion and trends. But because you have a huge unpaid debt, you can forgo this and concentrate on repaying the loan.

Have a debt repayment strategy. Your unpaid debt of Sh120,000 requires you to make adjustments to your budget and squeeze on discretionary expenses or wants to get some money to start repaying the debt.

You can also channel the money meant for saving towards clearing the debt first then embark on a robust saving and investment scheme.

Set aside Sh10,000 every month to repay the loan and in 12 months you will have cleared it. You should know the difference between a good debt and a bad debt.

A good debt is able to repay itself but a bad one is financed from your salary and a different source of income.

It is not clear how much interest is charged for the loan you took to pay your sibling’s vocational college fees.

The debt itself is a liability. Make sure you save some money in an interest earning money market fund for such expenses.

Start a side hustle. To supplement your small income, scan your immediate environment and identify a problem that you can solve by providing an essential service.

Use your accounting skills to do part-time jobs like auditing for businesses, organisations and institutions at a modest fee.

Register an audit or accounting firm that offers accounting services. You can also do part-time teaching during your free time in various institutions that offer accounting courses and earn extra money that can enable you to repay your debt, save and invest more.

Set SMARTER financial goals. Your goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. In terms of time, the goals should range from short-term (three to 12 months) to medium-term (two to five years) and long-term (five years and above).

One of the short-term goals include repaying the debt in one year. You can decide to save Sh5,000 in a money market fund and Sh5,000 in a Sacco in a span of two years once you have cleared the outstanding debt.

A long-term goal can be to take a Sacco loan in five years’ time and invest in real estate.

You are still young and have plenty of time to plan your finances wisely. Strive to acquire financial literacy by enrolling in a personal financial coaching programme, hire the services of a financial coach and mentor who can walk along with you to accomplish your financial plans.

Remember, you cannot solve the same financial problem with the same mind that created it. You need a different software, a mental reprogramming and reconditioning for you to get the desired outcomes.

On your quest to change professions, this should be guided by your qualifications and whether nursing is something you are passionate about. Age is not a major factor as you are still young.

In fact, if you were to enroll for a nursing diploma in March 2025, you could be a qualified nurse by age 32.

The upside to this is that you will have two careers, one that you can practice full time (nursing) and one that you can use as a side hustle (accounting).

Financial implications will be there as nursing is a full time course that might require you to take a lengthy sabbatical from work, and probably move back in with your parents, not to mention the fees and related study costs that might be as high as around Sh450,000 at the end of the course.

How US is daring the world to find a dollar alternative,"The United States is merrily chipping away at the pillars that hold up the dollar as the world's reserve currency, with the latest blows coming from some powerful Americans questioning the rule of law following the conviction of Donald Trump.

In doing so, it is effectively daring the rest of the world to find an alternative - and so far, it appears to be winning.

The attacks on the legal system in the aftermath of former President Trump’s conviction follow other moves that are seen by some as the United States throwing down the gauntlet to the rest of the world.

The country has radically increased the use of sanctions as a punitive foreign policy tool. And it is adding on an immense amount of debt, leaving hapless foreigners who seek the safety and depth of its markets to fund its excesses.

Over the past three weeks, I have been asking financial services executives, global investors and other experts in Asia and the United States how long they think the Americans can keep at it without meaningful blowback. Several of the sources requested anonymity to speak candidly about the situation.

These conversations showed consternation is growing, both at home and abroad, about the consequences of US hubris. But despite trying, no one so far has been able to find a credible alternative or expects one to emerge anytime soon, and they have partly themselves to blame.

In Asia, for example, people are asking with increasing urgency what's their 'America plus 1', as they search for ways to reduce their US exposure and boost non-dollar trade flows.

But attempts to build such systems are slow-going or haven't gotten traction. And rising authoritarianism, threats to individual and property rights and geopolitical tensions have meant that even if US assets are less attractive than they were before, other options are worse.

A recent survey, for example, shows central bank reserve managers plan to increase their dollar holdings over the next 12 to 24 months as the rise in global geopolitical tensions and need for liquidity draw them to the currency.

""Perhaps ironically, the US dollar's strength is, in part, due to its near-unchallenged safe-haven status,"" said Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, who served on former President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. ""That said, most investors don't understand geopolitics and the dangers that lurk below the surface – until it's too late.""

Dollar's dominance

At its core, the dollar's dominant role in the world draws from the United States' democratic principles. It is supported by the massive size of its economy, the depth of its markets, and the strength of its institutions and the rule of law.

The belief in democracy runs deep. Last week, I asked US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has been in government since 1997, whether partisan politics had made the job of officials like him harder. A conservative-leaning US appeals court had struck down one of his signature initiatives that morning.

""I believe in this constitutional system that we have. It's messy,"" Gensler said. ""It's democracy.""

Nevertheless, the messiness is testing some of the underpinnings of the dollar's global appeal.

Attacks on the US legal system have increased after the Trump verdict in a New York court. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for example, called it a ""kangaroo court"" on the social media platform X, saying ""the verdict represents the culmination of a legal process that has been bent to the political will of the actors involved.""

A major investor based in Asia said potential threats to US institutions were also worrying. Any debasing of the Federal Reserve's authority -- as Trump allies are reportedly contemplating -- would affect the dollar’s credibility, the investor said, adding that such a development could see a double-digit depreciation of the currency.

Trump's campaign for his Republican presidential bid has played down such reports of what conservative groups might be planning.

Thicket of sanctions

A senior New York-based financial services executive who was travelling in Asia said he is hearing from clients who think the US and Western financial policy is ""undermining the dollar and the Western financial system more broadly.""

He pointed to an ""ever expanding thicket of sanctions"" as one reason.

And the West is pushing the envelope further. The financial executive said the discussion that the West might seize some $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets that were blocked over Ukraine undermined the United States' safe haven status. ""The West crossed a Rubicon there,"" the executive said.

An October 2021 Treasury Department review of sanctions found such designations had increased to 9,421 by that year from 912 in 2000. It noted at the time that ""American adversaries — and some allies — are already reducing"" their use of the dollar.

An Asia-based investor said he was watching another court case closely to test the strength of the rule of law: ByteDance's challenge of a US ban on TikTok. He is watching for the evidence that the US government would produce to back up claims of the app being a national security threat.

If no proof is publicly offered, then it would ""feel that the checks and balance, the independence of the legal system, may not be there -- at least in this case,"" the investor said.

But then he added that even that may not turn him away from the United States. It's still more independent and better than many other places, he said.

Hope for women with fistula as more repair centres on the way,"When Magdaline Aoko ,67, stepped out of Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital on November 1, 2023, the joy written all over her face said it all. For the first time in 20 years, the mother of seven would finally get to interact with her friends without making them uncomfortable, something that had been made impossible by her health condition.Having lived with obstetric fistula for two decades, Magdaline, a resident of Kanyadoto in Ndhiwa Sub-county, had been deprived of her social life and suffered physical and psychological pain as well as social stigma. Her movements were limited to her compound as the condition would make her pass urine without control.

Trouble started in 2003 when Magdalene visited a local health facility in search of family planning services. Having given birth to 14 children, her family advised that she be placed on birth control. She chose tubal ligation — a permanent form of birth control in which a woman's fallopian tubes are tied or blocked.

But little did she know that the procedure would cost her her social life for the next couple of years. Magdalene notes that she started passing urine without control a few days after leaving the hospital. This was the beginning of a painful 20-year journey.

She bought medicines in different pharmacies while also avoiding taking liquids, but the condition got worse.

“Whenever I stepped out of my house, those around me would hastily disappear or cover their noses and mouths,” says Magdalene. Others would even spit in front of her, something that made her feel like an outcast.

To avoid the stigma, she resorted to spending most of her time indoors.

When she finally gathered courage to visit a health centre, she was diagnosed with obstetric fistula, an abnormal opening between a woman's genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum; causing urinary and faecal incontinence. Doctors explained that the condition arose from a botched tubal ligation procedure that she had underwent earlier on.

The condition, she was told by health workers, could be reversed. However, she could only get the services out of the county due to lack of equipment and qualified personnel in her home county.

She had to endure the stigma until November 2023, when she underwent corrective surgery at Homa Bay County Referral Hospital during a free medical camp.

The surgery was supported by the United Nations Population Fund, Mpesa Foundation, Africa Medical and Research Foundation, Beyond Zero, Flying Doctors Society of Africa and the county government.

More than 50 women benefited from the corrective surgeries.

The women cited lack of equipped facilities and trained health practitioners as the main factor derailing management of the condition. This is even as a number of counties are yet to put up health centres that can offer fistula corrective surgeries.

“I am glad to have received treatment. However, my biggest worry now is where to go for check-up since we do not have health experts in the county who attend to the condition,” she said.

Siprina Achieng, also diagnosed with fistula in 2008, has for the past 15 years been avoiding taking liquids to limit chances of passing urine while in public places.

The condition, she says, started after prolonged labour while giving birth to her fifth child.

She was advised to go to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital for the corrective procedure.

“I could not travel in the same vehicle with other passengers since those around me were always complaining due to the foul smell,” says Siprina, adding that hiring a vehicle would have been expensive.

As a result, she ended up spending 15 years confined to her house. According to the Ministry of Health, currently, Kenya  has only 10 health facilities attending to fistula cases .

A majority of fistula patients access medical care during medical outreaches, which don’t happen frequently.

But there is good news. In an effort to make the services more accessible, the government has announced plans to build five more fistula centres across the country by next year.

Dr Edward Serem, the head division of Reproductive Health at the Ministry of Health, said they are also going to train more fistula surgeons in efforts to move away from operating on women with the condition in medical camps.

“The number of fistula repair health facilities will increase to 15 even as we target to add the number medical experts specialising in fistula, which currently stands at 10,” said Dr Serem.

The maternal health expert said that although the medical camps have been helpful, they are ineffective since the women always go back home without a specific health facility for follow-up.

As a result, some of the women end up experiencing post-operative infections, which can result in death or prolonged stay in hospital.

“If any procedures are done in medical camps, we will ensure that the women are attached to a facility for regular check-ups; but the ultimate goal is to facilitate fistula repairs continuously and avoid waiting for the camps,” said Dr Serem.

According to the World Health Organization, every year, between 50,000 to 100,000 women worldwide are affected by obstetric fistula.

And in Kenya, about 3,000 women develop fistula every year. The ministry also estimates that children die in 90 per cent of pregnancies where a woman develops fistula.

A report from the Global Fistula Map says about 24,000 women in Kenya need the corrective surgeries. Only 2 000 accessed the services in 2021, leaving a backlog of patients in need of the services.

Anger as graft claims rock eviction drive in Mathare and Mukuru,"Dozens of residents in Nairobi’s Mukuru Kayaba slum are among the victims whose names are missing from the list submitted to administrators for the Sh10,000 payout from the government’s flood relief kitty.

Those who spoke to the Nation on condition of anonymity claimed fraudulent activities had marred the whole process.

Speaking on Sunday, June 9, Starehe Deputy County Commissioner John Kisang directed that the missing names of genuine victims be submitted to the South B office and a copy of the list be sent to him.

“We cannot allow illegalities to take place in the government’s office. We shall check to verify and if we find that someone was involved in corruption, he or she will be held accountable,” Mr Kisang said. The government had promised to give every household Sh10,000 ahead of an exercise to remove structures built on riparian zones along rivers Nairobi, Ngong and Mathare.

Lack of transparency

Questions are now being raised over the ongoing demolitions in Mathare, with a section of residents claiming that they are being forced to part with bribes for their homes to be spared.

Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) officials who visited the area at the weekend lamented that people with disabilities (PWDs) were being neglected.

“There is lack of transparency in the distribution of the money and even aid meant for victims does not reach the hands of the PWDs,” he said, asking the government to look after women and children as well. Still, I Rise International School Director Susan Irungu told the Nation she had been approached by unnamed officials with bribe demands to stop the demolition of the institution.

“They demanded Sh1 million but I refused,” Ms Irungu said.

The school’s CEO, Mr Nocolo Govoni, wondered why the State had condemned the school for being built on riparian land despite the institution recently receiving a certificate of operation from the Ministry of Education.

Furthermore, he said, officials from the National Environment Management Authority inspected the facility and gave it a clean bill of health.

“Why did they issue us with a certificate if we are on riparian land?” Mr Govoni posed.

"Cars, fridges, TVs top list of collateral for Sh5.1trn loans","More Kenyans are mortgaging household items including televisions, fridges, tables, and sofa sets to secure loans as borrowers turn to expensive short-term credit to meet daily needs after real wages dropped for the fourth consecutive year.

The Business Registration Service (BRS) under the Attorney-General’s office reveals that 100,985 pieces of household items were used for loans in the year to June 2023, which is more than any other type of movable property.

The BRS, formerly known as the Registrar of Companies, is the custodian of the Movable Property Security Rights (MPSR) registry, through which creditors such as banks list their rights over goods used by borrowers as loan securities.

Household items are increasingly being used as security to secure low-value loans because they are readily available, and for creditors, these items can easily be auctioned to recover defaulted loans.

Motor vehicles were the second most used movable assets that borrowers used to secure loans, with creditors registering 60,200 vehicles during the period.

Furniture and equipment were also heavily used for borrowing, with 51,483 and 36,236 pieces respectively used to secure loans during the period as livestock (34,638) closed the top five most collateralised movable assets.

The increased use of these goods comes when separate surveys indicate that more households are tapping loans to meet their daily needs such as food, health and rent costs. This is happening when pay increases have for the fourth year in a row lagged inflation, narrowing households’ disposable income.

“During the period between July 2022 and June 2023, the most preferred type of movable collateral used to secure credit included household items, motor vehicles and furniture,” said BRS.

Other top movable assets that were charged against loans include stock trade (8,002), acquired property (3,131), securities (2,573), inventory (1,890), crops (1,495) and bank accounts (1,333).The list also includes intellectual property (610), documents title (529), consumer goods (257) and negotiable instruments (23).

According to the BRS, movable assets – in addition to immovable property such as land and buildings – were used to secure Sh5.1 trillion worth of loans during the period.

“The cumulative amount of credit facilitated by MPSR from July 2022 to June 2023 amounted to approximately Sh5.1 trillion,” said the agency.

This comes when individuals and firms are navigating a turbulent economic environment underpinned by high taxation and inflation which has the business environment worse.

Although the economy grew at 5.6 percent in 2023 from 4.9 percent in 2022, it struggled to generate new jobs, and real wages shrank in the face of low pay raises and high inflation.

The 2024 Economic Survey published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) said the average pay increase in 2023 was 2.8 percent, while real wages adjusted for inflation fell by 4.1 percent. This meant that annual real wage earnings per employee in 2023 decreased to Sh667,300, or Sh55,608 a month, from Sh696,144 or Sh58,012 monthly in 2022.

Firms also froze pay increases last year as they experienced higher operating costs due to inflation and higher taxes, combined with reduced purchasing power among their customers due to the same factors.

Employers have also warned that it will take longer for pay raises to return to pre-Covid levels, with firms fretting over business uncertainties despite the economic rebound. Taxes proposed in the Finance Bill 2024 are also likely to weigh heavily on businesses, should they be approved later this month.

This combination of low pay increases and high inflation has, therefore, resulted in growing household consumption pressures and cash flow headaches for businesses, forcing them to release assets to secure loans.



Kenya enacted the Movable Property Security Rights Act in 2017 which provided a legal framework that governs the use of movable property as collateral which led to the establishment of the register in May 2017 to replace the chattels registry.

This has enabled borrowers to use such assets to secure loans, while lenders have gained more confidence to lend to such borrowers as such assets cover their outstanding loans in case of default.The increased demand for loans, as well as the growth in the formalisation of collateral use, has seen more creditors join the market.

According to the BRS, some 170,124 creditors issued loans to borrowers during the period, marking an increase of 40.19 percent compared to 121,350 creditors in the previous year.

Over the last five years, most of the household loans in Kenya have been spent on food, school fees, rent and other subsistence needs, in a departure from when credit was mainly used on investments and buying assets such as houses, land and motor vehicles.

Banks have said that borrowing for short-term needs has been a key driving factor in the growth of their loan book.

They have also seen a steady increase in the stock of non-performing loans, reflecting the tough economic conditions facing borrowers.

At the end of January, the latest data from the Central Bank of Kenya shows, the volume of bad loans in the banking sector stood at Sh638.4 billion, equivalent to 15.1 percent of the sector’s gross loans of Sh4.22 trillion. A year earlier, bad loans amounted to Sh496.6 billion or 13.4 percent of the total.

Car imports signal rebound after plunge,"A fall in motor vehicle imports witnessed over the past two years has eased out, signalling recovery on the back of stabilising exchange rate and improved availability of dollars, analysis of official data shows.

Traders and households spent $267 million to ship in motor vehicles in the first four months of the year, largely unchanged from $268 million in a similar period a year ago.

The 0.37 percent drop is an improvement from the 14.65 percent fall last year from $314 million, according to provisional data from the Central Bank of Kenya and the Kenya Revenue Authority.

Dealers last year complained of the wracking impact of a weakening shilling on businesses amid difficulties in accessing adequate dollars for small traders. They also cited the high cost of bank loans in an environment of high inflation that had eroded the purchasing power of households.

The double-digit drop in expenditure on vehicle imports in the past two years running, however, appears to be improving going by the data.

However, the dealers are cautiously optimistic about an upturn this year, citing a stabilising foreign exchange market.

“The exchange rate is beginning to turn. It has been difficult to import vehicles and vehicle parts because we needed to buy dollars to get these materials from abroad. Aside from the bad [exchange] rate, it was also hard to get dollars,” Rita Kavashe, managing director at Isuzu East Africa, said in an interview with the Business Daily in March.

The shilling had gained about 15.6 percent between the beginning of the year and April, trading at about 133 units to the dollar compared to 158 at the start of the year, according to CBK statistics. The increased expenditure on vehicle imports will likely be cheered by the Treasury.

Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u had last November in the Budget Review and Outlook Paper (BROP) cited a drop in motor vehicle, cosmetics and alcoholic drinks imports as one of the reasons for the shortfall in excise duty collections.

Motor vehicle imports are among the major sources of taxes and a drop in the imports cuts revenue receipts for the KRA.

Importation of vehicles, which is restricted to units manufactured not more than eight years ago, attracts a duty of 35 percent. The imports also pay excise duty ranging from 25 percent to 35 percent, depending on the size of the engine as the standard 16 VAT also applies. Excise tax is charged on the landed cost of the car and import duty while VAT is on the resultant value.



Last year’s slide in the value of the shilling made car imports more expensive, prompting some dealers to cut orders at a time demand also dropped. “Business [for secondhand car dealers] is very low and banks have become very strict on financing the purchase of cars,” Charles Munyori, the secretary-general for Kenya Auto Bazaar Association, which represents second-hand car dealers, had said late last year. “Purchasing power is also down and, therefore, dealers have been forced to venture into other businesses to survive.”

Read: Prices of imported used cars to drop on strong shilling

The automobile market is, however, still grappling with the high cost of credit which has limited purchase of the units, especially new cars.

Banks are charging as much as 25 percent interest for financing the purchase of cars, according to dealers.

The cost of credit has generally remained high after the CBK’s Monetary Policy Committee raised its benchmark interest rate by six percentage points since May 2022 to counter a recent wave of inflationary pressure.

Increasing the central bank rate makes borrowing more expensive as lenders use it as a base on which they load their margins and risk profile of individual borrowers.

The high interest rates and high taxation have depressed local demand for new cars as most of the orders are financed by banks, industry data shows. Sales of new motor vehicles fell 17.66 percent to 2,271 units in the first quarter of the year, according to data tracked by the Kenya Motor Industry Association (KMI).

The KMI data shows Isuzu East Africa and CFAO Motors Kenya, which control about three-quarters of the new vehicle sales on average, were among the hardest hit dealers.

CFAO, which a year ago bucked the industry trend of flagging sales, posted a fall of 21.6 percent, the fastest year-on-year drop among the biggest dealers in the review quarter.

The firm that sells brands such as Toyota, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Hino under one roof following the merger of Toyota Kenya and DT Dobie operation in May last year processed orders for 755 vehicles compared to 963 units a year earlier.

Market leader Isuzu East Africa’s sales contracted 12.3 percent to 1,030 units from 1,174 units in the prior year. However, the market share of Isuzu, which sells pick-ups, buses, trucks, and sport utility vehicles, increased to 45.4 percent in the review quarter from 42.6 percent the year before.

Simba Corp, which holds multiple franchises including Mitsubishi and Proton brands, however, bucked the trend after growing sales by a modest 2.8 percent to 255 units. This helped raise its share of the market to 11.2 percent in the review quarter from 9.0 percent the year before.

Inside Kenya’s five-year plan to enhance gender equality,"The government has launched a five-year plan to enhance gender equality.

The State Department of Gender and Affirmative Action last week launched the 2023–27 plan that seeks to undertake the constitutional mandate of advancing gender equality, non-discrimination and empowerment of all women and girls.

The plan, among others, seeks to reduce gender disparity in public and private spheres, prevalence of gender-based violence, female genital mutilation and other harmful cultural practices.

Read: Gender equality isn’t a competition but a unifying force for progress

It also aims to enhance opportunities and capacity for women and other vulnerable groups to participate in national development and reinforce evidence-based decision-making on gender issues.

Gender Cabinet Secretary Aisha Jumwa said the plan is aligned with Vision 2030 and its fourth medium-term plan under the social sector pillar.

Ms Jumwa added that at the core of the strategic plan is the bottom-up economic transformation agenda (Beta) for inclusive growth.

“The gender sector will play a crucial role to ensure achievement of aspiration and various interventions in Kenya Vision 2030.The state department commits to working towards the achievement of a society free from gender discrimination and violence,” she said.

The launch is in fulfilment of the Public Service Commission (Performance Management Act) Regulations 2021, which stipulated that every public institution should develop its strategic plan in a participatory manner.

Read: Real measure of women’s inclusion is at the grassroots

According to Chapter Four of the Kenyan Constitution, on the Bill of Rights, every person is equal before the law and has the rights to equal protection and benefit of the law.

Women and men have the right to equal treatment, including the right to equal opportunities in political, economic, cultural and social spheres.

The law prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination. The state is expected to take legislative and other measures, including affirmative action programmes and policies designed to redress any disadvantage suffered by individuals or groups because of past discrimination.

Kenya has in particular been lagging behind in the area of women participation in political leadership.

Read: Gender equality takes backseat in government plans

According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, Kenya still lags behind in the representation of women at both houses, with only 23 per cent compared to Rwanda, which has the highest percentage score of 61 per cent.

Other East African countries include Burundi with a percentage score of 38, Tanzania with 37 and Uganda with 35.

Interestingly, the youngest nation in Africa and the newest member to the East African Community–South Sudan–performs better than Kenya with 28 per cent.

However, it’s not all gloomy in some areas as Kenya has nearly achieved gender parity in education at all levels, ensuring inclusive, quality education for all by 2030.

Read: About gender equality, Kenya is not there yet

The enactment of the Constitution and the Basic Education Act of 2013 emphasises the right to education for all children, regardless of gender.

This legislation also stresses the elimination of gender discrimination in schools. Over the recent past, Kenya has made significant strides towards achieving gender parity in education on a national scale.

Kericho’s Robin Magrer wins Nation Classic tourney,"High handicap golfer, Robin Magrer, beat a field of 135 golfers at the high altitude Nyahururu Country Club course, to claim the overall title in the second leg of Nation Classic Golf Series at the weekend.

Little-known Magrer, playing off handicap 27, produced 46 points for his first victory at the Nyahururu Course.

“The last time I played here, I had a very rough time and I returned a poor score, so I promised myself to put my head down today and see how I play this time round. I am very happy and excited to have emerged the winner here,’’ said Magrer.

It was also a great outing for former Nyahururu Country Club captain Nderi Ndiani, who birdied the sixth and 10th holes, and bogeyed three holes for a total of 40 points to claim the First Division title, beating Samuel Mwang by one point.

In Division Two for those playing off handicap 11 to 19, Nakuru’s Francis Githuku won with 38 points, same as G. Sahota who took the second prize. High handicapper Peter Wainaina carded 43 points to clinch the third division title ahead of Teresia Ndegwa on 42 points.

Samuel Kingori emerged the best guest with a score of 39 points, with Duncan Mbuthia claiming the staff prize on 32 points.

Aday before the tournament, Nation Media Group donated text books worth over Sh200,000 to Kiheo Comprehensive School in Nyahururu. The donation was supported by, among other corporates, Panari Hotels and Resorts, Taifa Sacco, and Expeditions Maasai Safaris. Speaking during the prize-giving ceremony Nation Media Group Chairman Dr Wilfred Kiboro said the club has made tremendous improvement over the years.

Improvements

“You have done a lot to improve almost every facility, from the Club House to the golf course, and I congratulate the management committee on that,’’ Kiboro said.



He congratulated the club’s greenkeeper for work well done on the golf course, saying the club can now compete effectively with any other club in the country.

“We have been coming here for many years, and have supported the club to uplift its club house facilities. We will definitely support you when you open the second nine,’’ Kiboro, who is also a member of the club, said.

The club’s chairman, Kieru Wambui thanked NMG for having hosted one of the events in this year’s Nation Classic Golf series at the facility.

“You have been a big support of this club and we urge you to continue supporting us as we endeavour to improve our facilities and make Nyahururu Sports Club a club of choice’’ said the Chairman.

The third leg of this year’s series will be held at Nyali Golf and Country Club in Mombasa on July 13, 2024 and will be open to players from Malindi Country Club, Mombasa Golf Club, Vipingo Ridge, and Diamonds Leisure Golf and Beach Resort.

"SGR passengers down by 65,833, revenue up 33pc on higher fares","Passenger numbers on the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) dropped by 65,833 between January and March this year, new data shows, in the wake of hiked fares even as revenues jumped.

Data from the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) shows that 531,673 used the train in the period, down from 597,506 between January and March last year.

The sharp drop came in the wake of a decision by the KRC to hike fares by 50 percent, with passengers paying Sh3,000 between Nairobi and Mombasa one-way up from Sh1,500 effective January this year.

But the hiking of fares drove the passenger trains’ revenues to Sh80,819,035 in the period, a 33 percent rise from Sh660,155,283 booked in the same period last year.

SGR, popular as Madaraka Express is however struggling to break even with expenses outstripping revenues, leaving the train to rely on taxpayer money to fund operations and also payment of the multi-billion loan that was tapped from a Chinese bank to fund the construction of the railway from Mombasa to Naivasha.

“This (allocation) implies that the SGR project is supported by the taxpayer which is an indication that the project is struggling to break even six years after the operationalisation of the passenger and freight services,” the budget committee of Parliament said last week while approving budgetary allocation for the trains.

SGR’s passenger numbers dropped to 192,376 in January— the first month of the fares— which was a drop of 22 percent from 247,011 passengers who used the trains in January 2023.

Revenues peaked to a monthly high of Sh312,443,190 in January this year, a jump of 19 percent from the Sh261,959,811 collected in January 2023.



KRC hiked fares for both first class and economy coaches and for both inter-county and the express train, attributing the decision to high prices of fuel which significantly increased operational costs.

The raised fares took a hit on Kenyans who are grappling with the high cost of living, forcing the majority of the travellers to turn to road transport.

But the increased fares have compensated for the loss in passenger numbers, which will boost the trains’ efforts to reduce reliance on the Treasury.

Operating costs of the SGR are not readily available although past documents tabled in Parliament showed it cost about Sh18 billion to operate the passenger and cargo trains, with fuel taking a huge chunk of the money.

Kenya tapped a $3.75 billion (Sh489.71 billion at current exchange rates) from the Chinese lender to fund the construction of the railway from Mombasa to Nairobi and later to Naivasha. SGR operates express passenger and cargo services from Nairobi to Mombasa and an inter-county service.

Last week, Parliament approved ShSh901 million from the Exchequer in the year starting to fund the completion of the passenger ticketing system and an integrated security system.

SGR operates express passenger and cargo services from Nairobi to Mombasa and an inter-county service with stations at Athi River, Emali, Kibwezi, Mtito Andei, Voi, Miasenyi as well as Mariakani stations.

"Banks splash billions on tech, talent to keep fraudsters at bay","Banks are splurging billions of shillings on updating and acquiring new software, retraining staff, and hiring new talent, highlighting the increased anti-fraud war amid rising threats on the sector that holds nearly Sh6 trillion in customer deposits.

Top commercial banks including KCB, Equity, Co-operative Bank of Kenya, NCBA, Stanbic Bank of Kenya and Absa Bank Kenya have all reported heightened attempted fraud, pushing them to invest in systems and people to fortify defences to detect, prevent and manage these threats.

NCBA, for instance, spent $31 million (Sh4.04 billion) in a modernising system to “fortify its cybersecurity infrastructure” while Absa, which last year lost Sh49 million to fraudsters and thwarted attempted fraud worth Sh498 million, says it was forced to purchase new fraud systems as well as upgrade.

Other lenders stepped up training of staff on the ever-evolving trends in fraud and dismissed employees aiding theft. KCB handled 48 disciplinary cases related to fraud in which it dismissed 22 employees as 26 resigned during the investigation, noting that its disciplinary process is “an effective means of deterrence of fraudulent activities.”

Banks say last year was particularly bad with incidents related to fraud, data privacy, cyberattacks and cybersecurity threats increasing. This manifested in different forms including social engineering, phishing, and ransomware attacks.

“Cyber risk continues to increase within the financial industry with more sophisticated attacks being meted on banks by exploiting vulnerabilities within the banks’ network and core banking systems to facilitate fraud or disrupt business operations,” said Stanbic Holdings in the latest annual report.

Diamond Trust Bank (DTB) said two of its “most challenging” customer experience issues for last year were service dilution and fraud, adding that the year presented increased incidents of reputational risk exposures related to cybersecurity and fraud, particularly around social engineering and ransomware attack.

DTB said prevalent and emerging trends are now centred on “loan and mobile banking fraud and embezzlement.”

Read: Ex-Co-op Bank staff charged with Sh2.2 million theft

“For mobile banking fraud, individual customers proved to be the vulnerable link, inadvertently sharing confidential information with fraudsters posing as representatives of banks or mobile service providers,” said DTB.

Banks have had to respond through new investments from markets such as the US and India, with the likes of Cooperative Bank of Kenya (Co-op Bank) and Stanbic migrating to new core banking systems. Co-op Bank rolled out a $50 million (Sh6.5 billion) system dubbed Finacle to, among other things, cut downtime incidents and enhance the security of transactions.

“Acknowledging the escalating threat of cyber risks within the industry, we have fortified our defences to detect, prevent and manage these threats. To enhance our staff’s ability to mitigate emerging threats, we conduct regular trainings on anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), with over 7,100 trainings having been conducted in 2023,” said Co-op Bank in the annual report.

The increased investment in the anti-fraud war has also come on the back of regulators imposing stricter guidelines and enforcement mechanisms that expose banks to huge financial fines when fraud or customer data leakages occur.

KCB said it last year frustrated 249 fraud incidents but did not mention the amount of money at stake. The lender reacted through training in the areas that had process lapses and improved controls on app sign-ups and Vooma wallet deposits. These efforts, it says, significantly reduced the number of social engineering cases.

KCB says it has now restricted Vooma mobile wallet top-ups to their own number and enhanced security features on the mobile banking app activation such as the use of one-time PINs, which has cut exposure of customers to social engineering.

“In 2023, exposures to successful fraud reduced by 70.5 percent compared to 2022, with the main drivers being internal and mobile banking-related frauds. The reduction was attributed to our continuous actions to reduce fraud losses through the constant review and enhancement of control standards,” said KCB.

The lender says it has invested in a new anti-fraud system that has automated the detection of fraud across banking systems by enabling the identification of unusual behaviour.

In July and August last year, Kenya’s digital infrastructure became the target of cyberattacks through a series of distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) that affected both public and private institutions.

KCB says the wave of cyber-attacks in the region has heightened its focus on building a defence against “nefarious threat actors” by investing in people, processes, and technologies.

“The organisation has and continues to make significant investments in cybersecurity controls across the various layers of technology, to ensure that the organisation can prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats and attacks,” said KCB.



The growing threat and sophistication of cyberattacks, coupled with the increasing digitisation of banking products and services as well as the use of third-party partnerships have served to increase the sector’s exposure to security risk.

DTB said it invested in advanced fraud detection tools and monitoring systems for real-time transaction monitoring, fraud analytics, and customer verification procedures to help identify and prevent fraudulent activities promptly.

“We also rolled out a defence-in-depth strategy, anchored on zero-trust architecture, which is a security architecture built to reduce a network’s attack surface, prevent lateral movement of threats, and lower the risk of data breaches,” said DTB.

The lender also developed a cloud computing policy to govern migration to and adoption of cloud technology. It expects to continue to invest in cyber and operational resilience this year.

The race to improve systems has also triggered a talent war in specialised roles such as information technology as the banking sector spends millions of shillings on upskilling existing employees but lose them to competitors.

Equity, which in mid-April this year suffered theft of Sh179.68 million by 551 account holders who received and fraudulently transferred the money to 11 banks and several M-Pesa accounts within seven days, has responded by beefing up its anti-fraud team.

The lender last month opened recruitment of key roles including a senior fraud manager for payments, a senior fraud manager in charge of insurance and investment, senior manager for security, and a fraud risk analyst.

Equity Group CEO James Mwangi said: “It has been embarrassing seeing our customers being social-engineered and losing money.”

NCBA says it has invested in “cutting-edge” technology such as cloud migration, data quality management, server upgrades and robust protocols.

The lender says investing in the utmost protection of customers’ financial data and personal information is one step ahead in addressing cyber security threats.

NCBA says stricter guidelines and enforcement have left banks with no option but to significantly invest in technology, personnel, and infrastructure to avert erosion of trust and fines that come when customers lose money or information leaks to the public.

“Financial institutions found themselves grappling with the complexities of compliance, as non-compliance posed severe financial and reputational risks, prompting a fundamental reevaluation of risk management strategies,” says NCBA.

Absa says it targets to overhaul its backend processing by not only automating it but also augmenting the automation with machine learning and artificial intelligence to drive operational efficiency and enhance early fraud detection.

“Fraud and cyber-insecurity remain potent challenges for financial institutions, exacerbated by social engineering challenges and ever-shifting fraud trends requiring increased vigilance and responsiveness,” notes Absa.

Anti-money laundering (AML) and fraud prevention have become a focal point for regulatory compliance efforts, with authorities such as the Central Bank of Kenya and the Financial Reporting Centre ramping up efforts to combat financial crimes and illicit activities. This is especially after Kenya was last year grey-listed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog.

Read: Banks raise spending on tech for customer service, fraud fight

Banks were required to implement robust AML controls using advanced technologies to enhance transaction monitoring and detection capabilities.

Kenya closed 2023 as one jurisdiction under increased monitoring by FATF and is working with the watchdog to address strategic deficiencies to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing (ML/TF/PF).

Lenders are projecting that Kenya’s efforts to get itself out of the grey list countries—jurisdictions under increased monitoring due to strategic deficiencies in countering ML/TF/PF risks—will see deeper regulatory scrutiny amid increased exposure to fines and penalties for non-compliance.

“Given this reality, we expect regulators to impose stringent requirements for safeguarding customer data and infrastructure, mandating comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks and regular assessments. This will likely increase the cost of compliance for NCBA Group, particularly given our broad relationships with global financial partners,” said NCBA.

President Ruto calls troops to order on rising wrangles in UDA,"President William Ruto has called his troops to order following escalating wrangles among United Democratic Alliance (UDA) leaders.

Dr Ruto- the UDA party leader, is reported to have addressed a myriad of issues affecting the party, including petitions calling for the removal of the party’s officials and National Elections Board (NEB) members.

According to insiders at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held at State House, Nairobi on Saturday, even though the perceived tiff between Dr Ruto and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua was not addressed, the President gave the leaders a dressing down, warning them against using his name in their political manoeuvres.

The President also directed that a National Steering Committee (NSC) meeting be convened to help resolve challenges facing the secretariat. Three members of staff are expected to appear before the committee.

This comes at a time when politicians and top government officials have joined in the public exchanges, issuing conflicting public statements. It is reported that the various WhatsApp groups also turned explosive, with the President and the DP sitting as silent listeners.

“The President and the DP deliberately shoved aside talks and exchanges on the infighting and the problems at the secretariat,” disclosed a source privy to the deliberations at the NEC.

The meeting is reported to have lasted from 3pm to 8.30pm.

Avoiding to weigh in on the public spat among leaders, the President is said to have instead focused on party issues.

“The meeting focused more on the elections where the NEB and the elections and nominations disputes resolutions committee submitted reports,” another official informed the Nation on condition of anonymity.

The President is reported to have pressed on the need to obey court orders. And as a result, the meeting resolved that the Narok and West Pokot elections stand postponed.

""Where the courts have issued orders stopping the election, we have to postpone. We must respect court orders,"" President Ruto told the meeting.

Exposing the deep-rooted problems in running UDA party affairs, the NEB was represented by the whole team led by chair Antony Mwaura, however, the Elections Dispute Resolution Committee (EDRC) only had the chairperson Joy Mdivo present.

Prior to the meeting, the Nation has established that there was drama around the venue for the NEC meeting.

“They wanted the meeting held at the party headquarters so as to deny the DP the routine presidential briefing that's done at State House before any meeting,” an MP told the Nation.

The elephant in the room was a petition seeking the removal of secretary-general Cleophas Malala.

However, things are said to have become complicated when four other petitions seeking the removal of Treasurer Japheth Nyakundi, Chairperson Cecily Mbarire and Mr Mwaura, the NEB chairperson, emerged.

The meeting resolved that the petitions were weak and, therefore, not admissible.

Electoral disputes continue to derail President Ruto’s ambitious grassroots polls as intense competition rocks the party.

Emergence of factions

There have been reports of the emergence of factions following the polls that kicked off on April 26 in seven counties, with protests being witnessed in some areas over disputes.

In Nairobi where DP Gachagua and Governor Johnson Sakaja have locked horns over the process of elections, Dr Ruto urged for a quick political settlement to allow the polls to proceed.

Mr Gachagua is said to be fronting Embakasi North MP James Gakuya against Mr Sakaja for the Nairobi county party chairmanship post.

Mr Malala hinted at the possibility of consensus in some areas to forestall fallout.

“Our focus is to strengthen the party. So any method that is geared towards achieving a strong, united party is encouraged...But in the same breath, I would like our members to approach the elections with an open mind of winning or losing. That is the basic principle of democracy,” Mr Malala told Nation.

Even as the disputes continue to rock the party, President Ruto gave a nod to phase two of the party elections to begin on June 22 in 13 counties. These are Mombasa, Uasin Gishu, Nyandarua, Tharaka-Nithi, Machakos, Kisii, Bungoma, Siaya, Taita-Taveta, Wajir, Tana River, Kwale and Marsabit counties.

The Head of State reportedly asked Mr Mwaura to proceed with county level elections in the counties of Homa Bay and Busia, whose constituency polls were not challenged.

The NEC meeting is also said to have addressed the contentious issue of the composition of the National Delegates Conference (NDC). NEC is said to have adopted the formula of sharing delegates based on the presidential vote that each county returned to the UDA presidential candidate in the 2022 elections.

This process will see counties that garnered more than 50 per cent produce 20 delegates each to the NDC, with others below that mark sharing other slots on a pro-rata basis. The third and fourth phases will take place on August 10 and August 24 in 15 and 12 counties, respectively.

In a statement after the NEC meeting, Mr Malala noted that the committee emphasized that “discipline is the engine that oils the party.”

“This follows recent occurrences where party members violated election rules and regulations and instances where party members contradicted and or disrespected senior party officials,” said Mr Malala.

"Kenya eyes Sh65bn foreign inflows on Europe, Asia economic upturn","Kenya is eyeing a growth of at least $503 million (Sh65.4 billion) in diaspora remittances this year compared to last year, riding on higher inflows from Europe and Asia as global economic prospects improve amid falling inflation.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) is projecting a year-on-year growth of 12 percent in remittances this year, which would raise the total annual flow from $4.19 billion (Sh544.7 billion) in 2023 to $4.69 billion (Sh610 billion) in 2024.

This would be the fastest annual growth in remittances in percentage terms since 2021, when the volume of cash Kenyans abroad sent home rose by 20 percent to $3.72 billion (Sh483.6 billion) as global economic activity recovered as the Covid-19 pandemic was brought under control.

In 2023, the cash sent home grew by four percent, while the growth in 2022 stood at eight percent.

The projected 12 percent growth, according to CBK Governor Kamau Thugge, is a conservative estimate, meaning that the expansion in remittance volumes could even be higher if the pace of growth over the first four months of this year is maintained.

Read: How Kenya plans to net Sh1trn from diaspora

In the four months to April, remittances grew by 20 percent to $1.6 billion (Sh208 billion) compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

Should this pace of growth be maintained over the remaining eight months of the year however, the annual increase for 2024 would jump to $838 million (Sh109 billion), beating the previous record of $750 million (Sh97.5 billion at today’s rate) that was seen in 2018.

“We have revised our projections for growth in remittances [in 2024] from the previous five percent. Although so far this year they have grown by 20 percent, we have been fairly cautious in our balance of payments and we have assumed an increase of only 12 percent,” said Dr Thugge in a briefing on the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Thursday.

“Therefore, there is likely the possibility of overperformance in the current account if we can get remittances to grow by 20 percent.”

Several factors have driven the faster growth in volumes this year, including lower inflation in key source markets such as the US and the UK, which has helped raise the volume of disposable income available to be sent abroad by workers in these countries.

The growth of the Middle East as a destination for Kenyan migrant labour has also boosted the volumes from the region, particularly Saudi Arabia which has since last year overtaken the UK as the second biggest source of remittance dollars for Kenya.



Sharp growth in remittances from other markets such as Australia, Germany, the UAE and Canada this year has also boosted the overall growth in volumes.

In the first four months of the year, volumes from Australia have gone up by 92.4 percent to $51 million (Sh6.63 billion), Canada by 82.8 percent to $40 million (Sh5.2 billion), UAE by 61 percent to $36 million (Sh4.7 billion) and Germany by 54 percent to $75 million (Sh9.8 billion).

Meanwhile, the US remittances rose by 8.5 percent to $840 million (Sh109.2 billion), Saudi Arabia by 16.7 percent to $138 million (Sh18 billion) and the UK by 27.6 percent to $131 million (Sh17 billion).

“The US continues to be the main source of remittances, but remittances are coming from many countries, so to that extent they are resilient…that is why we have been able to sustain the increase in volumes even when there is a slowdown in global economic growth,” added Dr Thugge.

Going forward, the anticipated rate cut in the US later this year has the potential to boost flows from the country, especially if Kenya maintains its attractive interest rates that can attract investors seeking better returns away from the US.

For Kenyans living abroad, participation in the local government securities market has also been made easier by the introduction of the CBK’s electronic bonds platform known as Dhow CSD.

New imagery tech brings photography to the blind,"Kenya's blind community can now feel photography and experience what their visually-abled compatriots see thanks to a tactile photography innovation that promises to boost inclusion.

The immersive technology lined up a Kenyan debut in October this year utilises elevated prints which exhibit features such as soundscapes, audio descriptions as well as braille for a perceptible experience that helps users connect with the images and the stories they tell.

The technology showcased during the Gitex Africa 2024 expo hosted in Morocco a fort night ago impressed the blind and the partially blind attendees.

Dr Hamid Nabil, Morocco’s first-ever blind student to achieve a PhD termed the experience inspiring, noting that the world of imagery had been shrouded in mystery for many people living with visual difficulties.

“I believe that this initiative can give an approximatively clear view in a way that will make people discover the world of image in a way that is exclusively adapted to their situation and to their needs,” Dr Nabil the Business Daily during the expo.

He added, “The idea can be a source of inspiration in the sense that it can be integrated in different areas, especially within our educational systems. It can actually pave the way to future undertakings related to the production and development of curriculum programmes that are exclusively prepared for visually impaired students.”

In an interview with the Business Daily on the sidelines of the expo, Canon, the tech multinational behind the innovation, said the tactile photography is set to transform the experiences of blind users and bring them closer to those of their visually-abled counterparts.

“It will give people who have difficulties in seeing a chance to feel photography and experience what those of us with well-functioning eyes can see,” said Canon’s business-to-consumer (B2C) business director Rashad Ghani.

So, how exactly does it work?

Mr Ghani explained that descriptions of pictures taken are translated into braille which further eases the comprehension for people who have difficulty in seeing. They can also touch the elevated print and feel or sense what exactly is captured.

“This new service opens up the world of photography and enables more blind and partially sighted people to experience the emotive stories through the physical touch of these iconic images. It is to see the possibilities of textured print and to see in action how technology can make art more accessible for people with sight loss,” said Mr Ghani.

Canon has already tested the innovation in Europe and debuted it in Morocco. Mr Ghani said the technology is set for distribution to other prime markets with Kenya being earmarked for October this year.

“We chose Gitex as an opportunity to showcase and collaborate with the organisers so that the launch is with a bigger audience. So from here now, we will move to different countries and we should be in Kenya by October.”

At the expo, Canon’s exhibition featured works from its ambassadors across the globe as well as from world-renowned photographers, with visually impaired attendees expressing their reactions after interacting with the technology for the first time.

Canon has however left markets guessing on the pricing of the service, with Mr Ghani only stating that charges will vary across different markets due to among other factors, fluctuating taxation regimes in different countries.

CBK tightens interbank rates to lower credit costs,"The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has tightened the gap between interbank rates—the rate at which banks lend cash to each other in the short term, with its benchmark lending rate as part of new reforms aimed at lowering the cost of credit in the economy.

The reforms involve controlling an interest corridor by setting the upper and lower limits of interbank rates and the CBK emergency loan rates in alignment with the prevailing Central Bank Rate(CBR).

Under the reforms, the interbank lending rates are expected to stick around 1.5 percent of the prevailing CBR, from 2.5 percent previously while the discount window rate – the rate at which banks can tap funds from the CBK as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues, including borrowing from each other--. has been lowered to three percent above the CBR from four percent previously.

In August last year, the CBK approved a new policy framework establishing the two limits with the view of reducing inefficiencies in the interbank market including segmentation of banks by size.

The apex bank now sees further chances of improving the interbank operations and the transmission of its interest rate decisions. “To enhance the effectiveness of the monetary policy implementation framework, the MPC considered and approved a recommendation to review the width of the interest rate corridor around the CBR from the current 250 basis points to 150 basis points,” CBK noted.

The additional reforms stemmed from the need to counter segmentation where smaller banks have faced steeper interest rates in the overnight lending market than their larger peers.

For instance, before the adoption of the modernized monetary policy framework, smaller commercial banks often borrowed at costs higher than the discount window rate which describes the rate paid for borrowing from the CBK as the lender of last resort.



Under the new framework, interbank lending rates are expected to stick below the discount window rate.

This implies that commercial banks unable to access funding from the interbank market should turn to CBK’s discount window for facilitation. The discount window provides secured loans to commercial banks on an overnight basis at a penal rate above the benchmark lending rate.

Read: Interbank loan rates rise to 7.9pc over tight liquidity

The punitive rate restricts banks from seeking funds in the market only resorting to CBK funds as a last solution.

While the reforms signal lower interbank rates, CBK says the move is not equivalent to the loosening of interest rates/monetary policy. “This is just a refinement of the current framework just to be able to make it more effective and for the transmission of monetary policy to be more direct,” CBK Governor Kamau Thugge told a media briefing on Thursday.

The average interbank rate currently tracks the narrower corridor having stood at 13.21 percent as of Wednesday.

The reforms on enforcing control over interbank rates are part of deal between the CBK and the International Monetary Fund after it emerged that banks for a long time ignored the CBR when adjusting lending rates to customers.

Banks take on digital lenders with mobile loans in market share race,"A majority of Kenyan banks have now turned to smartphone applications and mobile banking systems for lending to their customers as the rise of digital lenders eats into the market that was traditionally preserved for them.

The latest banking sector innovation survey by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) reveals that 74 percent of commercial banks in the country have now digitized their lending services, up from only 44 percent in 2022.

Credit, deposit, and capital-raising services have overtaken payments, clearing, and settlement as the most digitized function in banks, an indication of the increased importance Kenyan lenders have attached to it as digital lenders eat into their market.

“Credit, deposit, and capital raising services were the functional areas where most banks introduced an innovative product in the period January 1 - December 31, 2023,” CBK said in the survey report published on Friday.

This comes at a time when the banking sector regulator allowed even more digital lenders to operate in the Kenyan market, giving commercial banks a run for their money in the retail lending business.

Last year, CBK licensed 10 more digital lenders, bringing up the total number of digital credit providers in the country to 32, and an additional 19 got the regulator’s nod this year, intensifying competition in the business of lending to small-time borrowers.

Currently, there are 480 digital lending businesses in the pipeline, awaiting CBK's nod, and may soon enter the market intensifying the competition in the business. This seems to have unsettled banks, which have now also taken their lending digital.

Read: CBK issues licences to 19 more digital credit firms

Digitisation has become increasingly important for Kenyan banks over the last year as the majority of them actively engaged in and invested in innovative technologies to improve service delivery to their customers.

According to the report, the number of banks that leverage financial technologies to digitize and modernise their operations increased by 19 percent from 60 percent in 2022 to 79 percent currently.

Currently, only two percent of lenders do not actively leverage digital technologies to streamline their services but use fintech startups and third-party firms to offer digital solutions to their customer base.

Banks that embrace digital technologies through collaborating or partnering with fintech startups also dropped from 25 percent in 2022, to 9 percent last year, an indication that banks are increasingly opting to go digital.

After credit and payment services, the third most digitised functionality for Kenyan banks is now customer support services, followed by incidental business activities like bancassurance, and the least is investment management.

Help! Mom is a dictator,"My brother and I are abusing cannabis and other drugs. We know we need help. How can we help our father take charge of our home? He seems scared of her.

We will assume that you are in your late teens or early 20s. There are three issues that seem to be at play. The first has to do with what amounts to a weak man of the house and the other a strong and dominating mother. The third is that you and your brother are using drugs, perhaps to help you deal with the stress in the family.

Yours is primarily a marital/family problem between your parents. The two of you are collateral damage as the two bulls square it out in their marriage. Sadly, no easy solutions come to mind. Some possibilities include to either address your parents on how their relationship is making you and your brother feel or in the alternative you might talk to an uncle or aunt that you trust, and who your parents might listen to. Sometimes a grandfather could play a similar role.

Several years ago, we saw a young man in a similar situation. He had been arrested for possession of cannabis. Looking at him, the police officer concluded that the young man needed the help of a medical specialist. That was one of the earliest referrals from police stations to us.

We asked for the parents of the young man to come. The very loud-speaking mother drove very fast into the hospital in a pickup truck full of potatoes. Before any questions could be put to her, she pulled out a kiboko (whip) and asked us to show her where the spineless brut of a boy had been kept. To her, all the lazy boy needed was a few whiplashes, and he would soon be on the straight and narrow.

Told that this treatment was not recommended in this day and age, she drove out in a rage complaining that this sort of softy approach belonged to white American people and all men must have grit and take control of their lives.

She had no time for people like his father who could not stand up for themselves. She stated that she would not come back unless we allowed her to do what had worked for her father who used to drink too much. He was beaten almost to death by his mother, after which he did not touch another drink.

When the young man’s father arrived later that day, it was impossible to believe that he was the husband of the tigress that had rocked the entire hospital earlier that day. He was a little man, who wore clothes that had not been washed recently, and had a copy of the much-used holy Bible in one hand and a copy of a newspaper from the previous day.

He looked hungry and when he spoke, it was in a soft apologetic voice that essentially told us he needed as much help as his son, now well-sedated in his room.

For several minutes, the little man prayed. The prayer was not only for his now lost son who God must convert like the biblical prodigal son, but also for his wife. She was friends with the butcher’s son and this was shameful. Those present learnt a great deal about the family during this seemingly endless prayer. He continued.

The devil had first made himself manifest in his family through his wife who lost her way soon after marriage. She had damaged his male ego and like Samson of the Bible all his strength and confidence were lost. She would often ridicule his weak manhood even in public. He had turned to the church where he served as the head of the men’s fellowship, was in the choir, and was chair of both the building and fundraising committees.

To the world he was an exceptional leader, to his wife and family he was a spineless irritating father and husband. He had left all the “manly” duties including bringing up the boys as well as their discipline to their mother.

Through this single unsolicited prayer session, we learnt a great deal regarding the family dynamics. Like the biblical seeds that had fallen among the thorns, the children had been left to grow without parental care or supervision, as the mother made money at the market, and the father prayed.

Many months of family therapy failed to bring the couple back together but at least the boy went back to school.

Why Parliament gave techie Michael Macharia Sh1bn,"Tech firm Seven Seas Technology, co-founded by businessman Michael Macharia, is set for a boost after lawmakers set aside Sh1 billion to repay its dues owed by the government.

The National Assembly’s Budget and Appropriations Committee (BAC) has proposed an additional allocation of Sh1.55 billion to the Attorney-General’s budget on the Treasury’s initial estimates, out of which Sh1 billion will be paid to Seven Seas.

Mr Macharia owns 60 percent of the company. The allocation is a third of the Sh1.58 billion damages the government was ordered to pay the firm for breach of contract.

It is however unclear if the State has already paid the remaining portion of the damages.

“Increase Sh1 billion (recurrent) to settle pending bill owed to Seven Seas Technology Limited court arbitration,” said the committee chaired by Kiharu Member of Parliament Ndindi Nyoro.

The allocation is a major boost to the businessman, who took the government to court after a multi-billion-shilling contract he won was terminated.

Seven Seas, an IT services company, was awarded a Sh4.7 billion contract by the Ministry of Health to provide 98 government hospitals with technology for the Managed Equipment Service (MES) programme.

Part of the deal was the provision of teleradiology, which allows doctors in top hospitals to read X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and other medical images to treat patients in remote facilities.

The contract would, however, be terminated by the ministry in November 2019, triggering the legal battle that saw Seven Seas awarded Sh1.58 billion through arbitration by retired justice Aaron Ringera.

The arbitrator said the firm was owed the sum in unpaid bills and costs incurred by the firm before the contract was cancelled.

Read: Techie wins Sh1.6bn against State in cancelled IT tender

The firm’s claim for nearly Sh2 billion for lost profits was declined as this was not stated in the contract as a remedy for breaches.

If the payment is made, Mr Macharia will be among the lucky few businessmen and other victims of violations whose legal awards against the State have been paid. Courts have awarded damages totalling Sh150 billion against the government, Attorney-General Justin Muturi revealed last year.

Some of these awards have not been paid for decades, with beneficiaries losing hope of ever being paid compensation by the government despite the court awards.

The awards against the government include breaches of contracts for public tenders, unlawful dismissals, human rights violations, and other legal disputes.

The Treasury has been facing a hard time paying the awards which continue to rise, forcing the Attorney-General to propose strict laws to punish State agencies and officials responsible for the breaches to shoulder the awards.

“Going forward, I may be forced to recommend that State officers who are shown to be reckless in decision-making assume personal liability in certain instances,” said Mr Muturi last year.

In the meantime, Mr Macharia is so far enjoying a fine year after the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) earlier this year sparing Seven Seas from paying Sh610.56 million in taxes.

KRA had been given the go-ahead to collect Sh900.4 million in unpaid taxes from the technology company, but the two entities reached an out-of-court settlement which saw the firm lower its tax liability to just Sh289.84 million.

The taxman had slapped the firm with tax demands on August 27 last year for the period between 2015 and 2019.

"BasiGo, Kapu join WEF accelerator programme","Two Kenyan start-ups have been selected to join the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Technology Pioneers Community, giving them access to the organisation’s wide network of investors, mentors, and resources.

The two firms – BasiGo and Kapu – are among 100 other budding businesses from across the globe that have been selected to join the prestigious accelerator programme that boasts large multinationals such as Google and Spotify as alumni.

The program will kick off later this month, with the selected firms participating in the forum’s Annual Meeting of the New Champions in China, a gathering held regularly to brainstorm solutions to the globe’s challenges.

Along with the other startups joining the programme, the Kenyan firms will benefit from networking opportunities, technical support, mentorship, as well as visibility and recognition, but won’t get any financial grants or capital directly.

Verena Kuhn, WEF’s head of innovator communities, said the firms selected to join the programme this year are “revolutionising industries on a global scale.”

“These innovators are leveraging the most advanced technologies to drive the radical changes needed to confront the world's most urgent challenges,” Ms Kuhn said.

BasiGo is an electric bus manufacturer based in Kenya, but with a presence in Rwanda as well. It sells its buses on a pay-as-you-drive basis making them affordable to public service transport providers in the region.

Kapu, a social commerce platform founded by ex-Jumia executives, has been operating in Kenya since December 2022. It delivers groceries to a number of estates in Nairobi and expands into the rest of the continent.

The two firms are among only 4 from Africa that made the list, with the other two being Ghana’s Jetstream and Nigeria’s uLesson.

Only three other Kenyan startups have entered the programme before; the now folded Sendy, Access Afya, and aggrotech SunCulture, which was the only Kenyan firm that joined last year.

The program has produced many startups that have now grown to become worldwide multinationals, among them Google, Airbnb, and Spotify among others. The firms stay in the program for two years.

When chairman raps CEO publicly,"Watchmen at buildings, residences and car parks are, in my experience, some of the greatest purveyors of power plays. My power-play-biased mind interprets each watchman’s smirk as: “I hold the power to open or close this gate. You cannot come in unless I open it. You will recognise that power and kiss the ring of the askari gods before I let you in.”

Do you know who else holds power? A government regulatory authority. That power should be used judiciously so that the recipients of the regulatory authority’s services understand the objective of that use of power. What is the mischief that the rules and regulations are trying to cure?

If your regulated populace cannot understand that, they will view unjustified pronouncements as regulatory overreach and then grudging compliance and, often, regulatory evasion ensues. So you can imagine the uproar when the acting chief executive officer of the Kenya Films and Classification Board (KFCB) woke up one day and decided that YouTube is a dusty movie hall on Luthuli Avenue that he could walk into and thump his regulatory chest.

Towards the end of last month, the CEO sent out a series of individual letters to several popular Kenyan content creators and asked them to cease and desist from creating and releasing videos that had not received approval from the agency.

Quoting from the Film and Stage Plays Act, the CEO vituperatively called out content creators, frothing at the mouth with righteous indignation that these young and wildly successful creatives could purport to bypass KFCB’s regulatory power to authorise broadcasting, possession, distribution and exhibition of film and broadcast content in the country. Globalisation met the provincial and orthodox postulations from a red-carpeted, wood-panelled CEO office.

The CEO was likely emboldened by a highly publicised rapping of a Kenyan musician who had been hauled into the KFCB board room a few months earlier in March 2024 and read the riot act for publishing music videos. Quoting from their own press release, the KFCB management said that the artist “….was hard-pressed to explain why he had blatantly contravened Sections 4 (Part II) and 12 of the Cap 222 governing the creation, broadcasting, possession, distribution, and exhibition of audio-visual content in Kenya. The artiste was further put to task over the use of vulgarity, nudity, indecency, and violent dancing styles in his content, specifically in the ‘Niko Uchi’ song, among others.”

The acting CEO has been playing his part well in “protecting children from harmful exposure” and had issued a press release a year ago in April 2023, detailing the excruciating pain that he was undergoing at the loss of values demonstrated by videos being shared across Kenyan social media. But context is key.

The same place that the Kenyan content creators are posting their content is one in which creators all the way from Timbuktu to the Pacific island of Vanuatu can also be found by internet-enabled Kenyan children. The challenge for parents is how to limit access to harmful content. The challenge for KFCB, which their website already demonstrates they are doing, is to ensure continual engagement with these digital platforms including TikTok to discuss content monitoring and moderation.

Anyway, the chairman of the KFCB board of directors swooped in from left field to save Kenyan content creators who were just Netflix and chilling. A former radio presenter himself, the chairman issued his own statement on social media posting, “Our content creators should be supported all the way. They should be encouraged and supported 100%...I have directed the management to withdraw the notices and organise an engagement with all the stakeholders. We should be talking about thousands of opportunities if not hundreds of thousands of jobs in the digital media.”

It is a sad, scratch that, horrifying day when the chairman of a board has to come to the same unlicensed for broadcasting social media and air the organisation’s private lingerie to dry. The truth of the matter is that a board chair cannot direct management to do anything. Particularly when he is not an executive chair.

However, the board can. While everyone toasted the Pyrrhic victory over what appeared to be regulatory overreach, what was lost in the celebration was the greater governance overreach that had occurred. And, more importantly, the public way in which it was done. As the acting CEO nurses his rapped knuckles, governance observers will be asking themselves if the chairman’s misplaced public directive was genuinely aimed at helping the “victims” or laying the groundwork for personal, simmering political ambitions.

Pap smear : ABCs of cervical cancer screening,"It is advisable for all women between the age of 25 -65 years to have regular cervical cancer screening before you start experiencing initial symptoms when the abnormal cells are still treatable.

Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers if caught early. A simple test called the pap smear can save your life from cervical cancer. A Pap smear test can detect abnormal cells of the cervix before they become cancerous. These abnormal cells are usually very treatable without affecting your ability to have children.

Essentially, a pap smear test should be done every three years for all women aged between 25 - 65. HIV-positive women should have a pap smear test after every six months or one year from age 18 or at the time of diagnosis then annually thereafter.

How a pap smear is done

You will be asked to remove your undergarment and lie on your back. You will then be given a sheet to cover the lower half of your body. The nurse or doctor will place a speculum in the vagina to enable them to visualise the cervix. This should not hurt if you allow your body to relax.

A small brush is then used to obtain some scrapings from the cervix (much like rubbing the inside of your cheek with a toothbrush). The cells are put on a slide and taken to the lab where a pathologist looks at them.

A normal pap smear means your cervix is normal and healthy. A pap smear may also show signs of infection or inflammation. However, it does not check for sexually transmitted infections, there are other tests for that. Abnormal cells are a sign of precancerous changes which require treatment.

Read: Cervical cancer is a common but preventable disease

In case abnormal cells are detected, you may be advised on either additional tests such as an HPV test to detect the human papillomavirus or a colposcopy. This test will give more information about the degree of changes in the cells. If the colposcopy shows abnormal cells or precancerous cells (dysplasia), these will have to be treated.

Your treatment options

There are several ways of treating the abnormal cells. The procedure for treating the abnormal cells can be done as an outpatient procedure or a day surgery case and you may go home the same day. You will be able to have children even after these procedures.

In case you had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you need to check with your doctor first to advise if cervical screening is necessary.

Read: Fighting cervical cancer with hand-held device

What about human papillomavirus vaccine?

It is advisable to get the HPV vaccine from your healthcare provider, especially if you fall within the recommended age bracket. The vaccine is designed to prevent infection in women who have not been exposed to this virus. They are best suited for girls and women between the ages of 9 - 26 years.

The vaccine does not prevent all cervical cancers, and therefore you will still need regular pap smears even though you have been vaccinated.

"Counties, Treasury set for first peer review summit","Counties and the National Treasury will this month hold the inaugural summit to review the performance of devolution and map the way forward in a bid to boost economic growth and service delivery at the units.

The Kenyan office of the New Partnership for Africa's Development- African Peer Review Mechanism(Nepad-APRM) and 12 counties that have undergone self-assessment under the initiative will headline the summit set for June 26.

Kenya rolled out devolution in 2013 but it has been a mixed bag of successes and failures with economic policies, taxation, revenue collection, and prudent use of public funds being the major bottlenecks.

“County Peer Review Mechanism (CPRM) will promote good governance practices and facilitate peer learning of best practices for balanced socio-economic development across the country,” Nepad /APRM Kenya says.

CPRM is a multi-agency tool to be used in not only the promotion and entrenchment of good governance across the counties.

Nepad /APRM Kenya has already undertaken public surveys, getting insights on the successes and challenges facing county leaderships in Bungoma, Trans-Nzoia, Nandi, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nyeri, Machakos, Makueni, Mombasa, Siaya, Busia, Vihiga and Kakamega.

The data was incorporated into the self-assessment reports of the 12 counties that will form the basis for the summit to be held this month at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre.

Peer reviews by the counties are also key in helping the units to fit their development agenda into the country’s Vision 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agenda 2063 of the African Union.

Nepad is the economic development programme of the African Union and was formed more than two decades ago to eradicate poverty, promote sustainable development, integrate Africa into the global economy, and accelerate the empowerment of women.

Counties have since 2013 dismally missed revenue targets, spent significantly huge amounts of money on salaries and allowances, and squeezed funds for development besides perennial issues of flawed procurement leading to losses of billions and stalled projects.

For example, in the financial year that ended June 2023, counties collected Sh37.81 billion against a target of Sh57.37 billion. The units have also been breaching the law regarding expenditure on development projects compared to that on salaries, allowances, and benefits.

The devolved units have also been on the spot over poor delivery of health services and roads, with the failures attributed to poor decisions and lack of prudence in the use of money.

Counties are also grappling with questionable policies on taxation and economy which have significantly hit the investor climate.

Stars prospects a worry,"National football team Harambee Stars' stuttering performance in the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers Group F campaign is a major cause for concern.

In their latest home match, in Lilongwe, the Stars played out to a one-all draw with a lowly Burundi's Swallows in Lilongwe. Supporters had expected them to bag all three points but that came a cropper.

The match was played in Malawi since Kenya lacks a stadium that is certified by Fifa to host an international game. Nyayo Stadium and Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, both in Nairobi, and currently closed for renovations, had been declared unfit for matches. Kenya has also lost away 2-1 to Gabon’s Panthers before recovering to defeat Seychelles, another low-ranked team in African football, 3-0.

That, and with African champions Cote d’Ivoire as the next opponent for coach Engin Firat’s side in Lilongwe tomorrow, effectively leaves Kenya with a huge task to a first-ever Fifa World Cup Finals.

The Srars' struggle is despite being accorded by the government adequate resources to prepare them, including high-profile friendlies with Russia, Qatar and South Sudan. Besides, Firat seems not to get it right with his team selection, including inviting several foreign-based players, like Bruce Kamau from as far as Australia, only to drop them days to the match.

The constant bickering between Football Kenya Federation officials and legal battles ahead of its elections do not provide for a conducive environment for the national teams to perform. Many thought Kenya stood a chance after the World Cup was expanded from 32 to 48 teams with Africa given nine slots to the 2026 Finals to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. With Kenya in line to co-host the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations alongside Uganda and Tanzania, a significant shift in preparations and management of the team is required lest they become the whipping boys

"Why sustainability reporting must be year-round activity, not annual ritual","Sustainability or ESG (environmental, social and governance) accounts have become the mainstay of corporate reporting. Public and private sector leaders recognise the importance of providing a complete and connected picture of how their organisation creates value for stakeholders and positively impacts people’s lives.

Investors are equally demanding non-financial information and disclosures to understand how non-financial concerns or sustainability/ESG matters impact short-, medium- and long-term financial viability. Not-for-profit organisations are equally embracing sustainability reporting to communicate impact to donors to sustain funding for their activities.

Therefore, organisations need to recognise the common pitfalls of sustainability reporting, avoid them and leverage these reports for their benefit with their stakeholders. The sustainability landscape has evolved in the past few years, and some common principles and concepts are shared by the sustainability reporting frameworks and standards countries and regulators apply. The pitfalls could be legion and here are a few.

Organisations must ensure that their sustainability reports are prepared using a framework or standard. Organisations that do not apply a reporting framework or standard fail to demonstrate accountability and transparency with their stakeholders because there is no basis for them to be held accountable. Similar to how financial statements apply reporting frameworks such as IFRS or IPSAS, sustainability reporting should be prepared using a reporting standard such as GRI or IFRS S1 and IFRS S2.

Another risk not easily recognised when preparing sustainability reports that organisations should avoid is doing so in silos that are disconnected and inconsistent with other reports or information about the very organisations. For example, organisations need to ensure the information in their sustainability reports is aligned and connected with the information in their financial statements.

In extreme cases, such misalignment could result in significant risks of greenwashing by organisations as information included in their reports need to be reflected or accounted for in their financial statements.

Also, organisations must ensure that sustainability reporting is a year-round exercise and not a year-end exercise. Too often, organisations only begin to prepare their sustainability reports at the end of the financial year, which does not enable them to provide a comprehensive view of their performance on sustainability.

Good succession planning vital to family business,"Family-owned businesses are the backbone of many economies. They are renowned for promoting innovation and creating job opportunities, and Kenya is no exception. However, their success pivots on strong leadership, a sound business model and meticulous planning for the future.

Succession planning is the roadmap for continuity that ensures generations’ hard-earned legacy is preserved and driven forward into the future. Yet, amidst the multitude of business successes and operational challenges, it is one crucial aspect that is often overlooked.

In Kenya, the consequences of neglecting succession planning are all too familiar. We often see how the absence of clear legal frameworks and comprehensive estate planning of respectable families and their businesses has led to ownership disputes, hefty tax burdens, and operational disruptions following the passing of a family patriarch or matriarch, fracturing family bonds cultivated over generations.

But why do families often overlook the importance of succession planning? Some of the reasons are a cultural reluctance to confront mortality, a lack of awareness about the complexities involved, the fear of relinquishing control and the misconception that succession planning is a task best left for the distant future. While these fears are powerful deterrents, especially in Africa, the consequences of inaction are far worse.

Family bonds

A well-defined succession plan will strengthen family bonds by outlining ownership transitions, minimising tax burdens, and ensuring smooth handover through strategic estate planning—with minimal business disruption.

Founders of family-owned businesses should seek expert guidance to navigate the intricacies of succession planning. Advisory firms specialising in estate planning and business succession offer invaluable assistance in crafting tailored strategies that align with each family-owned enterprise’s unique needs and goals. From drafting wills and trust agreements to devising tax-efficient transfer mechanisms, these firms play a pivotal role in facilitating proactive planning and maximising the benefits of succession.

As the Good Book says, a good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children; the current generation needs to ensure mechanisms are in place that will create an enabling environment for the next. Through succession planning, businesses can ensure that the inherited values of the family continue to be reflected in the company and vice versa, providing the family’s legacy and shared purpose transcend generations.

As Kenyans continue to set up economically strong family businesses, they must consider robust succession planning continue. It is time for these businesses to recognise the value of planning future-proofing and proactively take steps to secure their legacies for future generations.

Data governance: The three essential considerations for responsible AI,"Data is the lifeblood of AI models, providing the information they need to function effectively and improve over time. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Ensuring high-quality, secure, and private data is paramount for the effective and responsible use of AI technologies.

The world of AI is undergoing a revolution, and it’s bringing a powerful new asset to the table. AI’s ability to crunch massive data and automate tasks transforms industries, uncovering hidden business opportunities and streamlining operations.

This technological leap is granting organisations a competitive edge, boosting productivity, and paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries. By embracing AI, they can unlock immense business value and become leaders in this exciting new era.

But without data, there can be no AI. All algorithms and models use data to calculate a solution or generate an answer to a question. In essence, data is the lifeblood of AI models, providing the input they need to function effectively and improve over time.

Responsible AI (RAI) is all about using AI technology ethically, fairly, and responsibly to minimise risks. It involves putting guardrails in place to ensure AI is used for good. Data governance therefore plays a critical role in RAI because the data used to train AI systems is fundamental to their decision-making.

Data access in AI must be governed by strict privacy and security controls. AI models should be granted access only to data that is essential for their operation and for which they have the appropriate authorization.

Preparing high-quality, secure, and private data for AI is therefore paramount. Data quality is critical as it directly influences AI outcomes, while security and privacy are essential to protect sensitive information and comply with regulations.

Although all aspects of data governance are important, these three areas stand out because of their significant impact on the performance and trustworthiness of AI systems. A comprehensive governance strategy that addresses these areas will facilitate the effective and responsible use of AI.

Leaving your data unprotected against AI can be a costly gamble. Hackers can leverage AI to launch targeted attacks, leading to hefty fines, legal battles, and expensive recovery efforts. Even if a breach isn’t malicious, the reputational damage can be crippling.

Exposed data also puts you at risk of identity theft and manipulation by AI systems designed to exploit personal information. Investing in data protection is therefore an investment in your security and peace of mind.

When AI systems access incorrect data in the corporate world, it can set off a cascade of harmful outcomes. The reliability of the AI’s outputs may be compromised, raising questions about its trustworthiness.

For example, biases in the data can skew the AI’s judgments and violate an organisation’s commitment to impartiality and diversity. Such a breach of trust in the AI’s accuracy can have long-lasting negative effects on its acceptance and use.

Legal issues are a major concern, too, as the mishandling of data can result in regulatory breaches and noncompliance with ethical standards. And diverting resources to unproductive AI projects can lead to financial and operational losses.

Strict data governance will mitigate these risks and ensure that AI remains a reliable and efficient business tool. Implementing AI systems can be exciting, but navigating the ethical considerations is crucial. Here are some suggestions to keep you on the right track.

Align your AI goals with your organization’s values. Aim for a positive social impact. Transparency is key: you should be able to explain how your AI makes decisions. This builds trust and allows for human intervention if needed (and it is part of the European Union’s AI Act).

Data governance lays the foundation for RAI. Use diverse, high-quality data that reflects the real world to minimize bias and involve people from various backgrounds in the development process to ensure fair outcomes. Implement robust data-security measures to protect user privacy and comply with data-privacy regulations.

RAI is an ongoing process. Regularly monitor your AI system’s outputs for bias, and refine your data and algorithms as needed. Be open to learning and adapting as AI technology evolves and societal norms change.

Data governance is a key part of the responsible use of AI technologies. So, put some effort into the quality and protection of your data – it’s your most valuable asset, after all – to avoid negative consequences such as compromised AI outputs or legal and financial issues.

School meals key to child welfare,"The Finance Bill, 2024 has come as a shocker to not only the taxpayers but also recipients of government services. The axe of austerity has fallen, indiscriminately chopping off the budgets for important social expenditure such as the national school feeding programme.

The programme has been a lifeline to many school children countrywide, making a major contribution to increased school attendance rates. It also reduces stunting in children, improving nutritional outcomes and thus their learning outcomes.

From a social protection perspective, scrapping school feeding would have a profound effect on the children who depend on it early into their life-cycle. It will also negatively impact the country’s human development index in the short term and, more importantly, have a disastrous long-term effect as regards our overall national human capital discourse.

The lack of clarity as to whether it has been scrapped or merely reallocated a different vote is even more worrisome and signifies a larger problem of poor policy articulation by the government.

Social protection

Scrapping of school meals would jeopardise numerous social protection partnerships developed over a long period to support such programmes and claw back the gains in extending the right to education to children from vulnerable households, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions, where it is a huge motivator to school attendance and retention.

Granted, the national government is facing a myriad challenges with financing its agenda and other obligations such as sovereign debt management. But there ought to be a better way of achieving fiscal austerity without defunding critical programmes.

The programme also links with the Kenya Kwanza government’s ‘Bottom-Up’ agenda, which seeks to give the vulnerable a fair shot at life through quality and affordable or free education. The programme is indispensable to the government’s basic education and social protection agenda.

Step up blue economy policing to protect fishery resources in Kenya,"The impacts of continued illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities have contributed to food insecurity and a loss of revenue for many low-income and least-developed countries.

The IUU fishing also represents a serious human rights issue: aside from the theft of fishery resources, there have been documented cases of forced labour and human trafficking.

For instance, data by Environmental Justice (EJF) reveals that Chinese vessels were linked to 86 unique cases relating to 177 suspected or confirmed offences of IUU fishing or human rights abuses in the South West Indian Ocean region between 2017 and 2023.

Half of these cases involved vessels owned or controlled by state-owned enterprises or enterprises in which the Chinese government has a partial interest. Of the 95 long liners currently believed to be authorised to target tuna in the South West Indian Ocean, 47 percent are linked to cases of IUU fishing and/or human rights abuses. For the 39 non-tuna fishing vessels, the figure is 26 percent. Therefore, many experts agree that drastically reducing the ability of IUU fishing activities to persist is a key component of poverty reduction and effort to achieve food security in the world’s most vulnerable coastal regions.

Data by the Automatic Identification System indicates that potential annual economic values associated with IUU fishing in Kenya and Tanzania stand at $10,963 and $31,321, respectively. Some nations in the South West Indian Ocean suffer potentially higher losses due to IUU fishing, such as Tanzania, representing roughly 45.8 percent of total losses in resource potential (around $65.4 million).

The greater losses to Tanzania are likely due to the higher export value of species from the area, as well as a high level of suspected unreported catch.

In Kenya, there are only seven industrial longliners targeting swordfishes within the exclusive economic zone of Kenya catching about 300 metric tonnes per annum despite the huge potential.

The tuna catch limit allocation for Kenya is low because we are catching less than island states such as Seychelles and Mauritius due to a small tuna fleet mainly dominated by artisanal fishing vessels that rarely submit substantive data on their catches.

The private sector is essential in supporting the development of a blue economy in Kenya, however, the government has a huge role to play in creating enabling policies and strategies.

The office of the attorney general also is supposed to look at the draft for verifications in line with the law before it is sent to Parliament. Public participation plays a huge role, after getting the public input it is taken back to parliament for another reading. If they are content it is put into a motion so it can be approved.

Fisheries management has traditionally been at national level, with little integration across the region. Sustainable management and utilisation of blue economy resources should incorporate the provisions of several regional, and global fisheries frameworks.

The government hasn’t effected the Oceans and fisheries policy, the National Plan of Action- IUU fishing, as well as the national blue economy strategy, among others, as well as reviewing the national tuna fisheries management and development strategy.

In recent years, there has been increasing activity from artisanal and small-scale fishers. This expansion has caused conflicts with the trawl sector, which are exacerbated by the trawlers’ high levels of bycatch discarding, where some of those species form part of artisanal fisheries’ targeted catches.

In addition to the high bycatch, the declining status of shrimp, prawn amongst other stocks is of great concern, as these species are low in the food chain and directly impact the health of other species, including those of commercial importance such as tuna.

Stymie the giraffe meat craze fuelling poaching,"



Stymie the giraffe meat craze fuelling poaching





The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) literally has a tall order on its hands: The threat posed by poachers targeting the huge, beautiful and graceful long-necked giraffes for meat, which is being mostly sold in refugee camps in the northeastern region. Locals and refugees believe eating the meat can enhance sexual desire. The bizarre fad is fuelling a poaching war that is bound to have disastrous consequences. The government agency’s key mandate is to protect wildlife, which is the country’s rich natural heritage. Wild animals are a major tourist attraction, yielding the revenue the country badly needs.

Quite disturbing, therefore, is the news that giraffe meat has become rather popular in Garissa County over a weird belief that it is an aphrodisiac. This is worrying just like the illegal hunters who slaughter elephants for their tusks and rhinos for their horns.

In China, the rhino horn is traditional medicine but has also been increasingly used as a status symbol, displaying wealth and success. This has spawned a lucrative market in Asia that could drive rhinos into extinction. Giraffes and antelopes are becoming the most hunted animals by the locals. Refugees, mostly from Somalia, do not have livestock and see these wild animals as an alternative source of meat.

Last week, police arrested four men who had reportedly killed a giraffe, amid reports of the animals being slaughtered on a weekly basis. There is a need for heightened surveillance and monitoring to help curb poaching. Body parts and hides are going to illegal domestic and foreign markets.

Though not necessarily threatened with extinction, the giraffe is covered under the laws protecting iconic species. The new threat poses a huge risk as it could erode the gains in wildlife conservation. It could ultimately dent tourism, an industry that is a top foreign exchange earner.

KWS and the local administration must move quickly and stem this new dangerous trend. They should boost game wardens' capacity as they sensitise the public on the vital contribution of wildlife to tourism and overall economic prosperity.

This holistic approach is not only pragmatic but essential in the context of rapid technological advancements that are reshaping global job markets.

The linguistic proficiency of, say, a student of Chinese provides substantial cultural and communicative benefits. But to transform this ability into tangible career opportunities, integrating complementary professional skills is vital.

For instance, adding expertise in human resources, accounting, management, engineering, business, tourism, hospitality, agriculture, climate or the blue economy will create a unique, versatile and highly sought after skill set.

Artificial intelligence

The urgency of this integration is accelerated by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its increasing role in language translation and interpretation. Current AI translation tools and apps like Google Translate, Baidu Translate and Deep L can perform translations with over 90 per cent accuracy, challenging the traditional translators and interpreters. This technological shift makes it necessary to acquire competencies that AI cannot replicate—like critical thinking, interpersonal communication and specialised industry knowledge.

In Kenya, Chinese was introduced in the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) in 2019 among other foreign languages like French, German and Arabic. Chinese learning falls under the people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cooperation between African countries and China in the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (Focac), due later this year.

The 2024 Joint Conference of Confucius Institutes in Africa, held on May 31, included a breakout plenary session on “Models of Cooperation between Confucius Institute and Chinese Enterprises and the Development of Chinese Plus Programme”. Its implementation basically means learning the Chinese language and a professional course. This is solely in line with the CBC and the Competency-Based Education and Training (CBET) policy framework that emphasises skills and competencies. This method is gaining popularity, especially in the technical and vocational education training (TVET) institutes, and is promoted in Luban workshops globally. A Luban workshop at Machakos University was jointly established with Tianjin City Vocational College.

Chinese tourists

The advantages of this integrated approach are countless. First, it broadens career opportunities. A bilingual accountant can work in international finance while a professional proficient in Chinese and tourism management is better placed to cater to the growing influx of Chinese tourists worldwide.

Secondly, it increases employability in an increasingly competitive job market. Employers seek candidates with more than just language skills. This has been echoed in various career fairs and expos.

Educational institutions and policymakers must recognise and support this integrated learning approach. Universities should offer interdisciplinary programmes that combine language studies with professional training. Students of Chinese language should diversify their skill set. Enrol in professional courses or acquire practical skills that complement your Chinese linguistic abilities.

Whether through formal education or hands-on experience, for instance, for Chinese translators who double as tour guides, enhancing one’s professional competencies alongside language learning significantly boosts employability and career prospects.

Jumwa: Why Kenya Kwanza may have an uphill task in Kilifi,"Gender Cabinet Secretary Ms Aisha Jumwa has raised concern that Kilifi politicians allied to President William Ruto may have a hard time getting the support of the electorate, claiming that the region is being sidelined in terms of development.

Speaking during the County dissemination for the government’s Fourth Medium Term Plan 2023-2027 forum in Kilifi, Ms Jumwa said it was unfortunate that the Kenya Kwanza leaders would have nothing to show to the electorate at the grassroots when questioned about what the government has in store for them in the next four years.

Ms Jumwa criticised the team handling the Fourth Medium Term Plan 2023-2027 for sidelining Kilifi in key development projects to be implemented under President Ruto’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda.

“As we were going through the report, I saw infrastructure developments of 6,000kms among others but in other regions… they have broken down the projects. You find a bridge is being constructed, this road…and I told them you know when you are going to Kilifi and there are roads that we know are so dear to us but they have not been listed, how will that be? Because we are going to tell the people and they will go to the ground to see the projects being implemented by the President within the four years but if there is nothing for us then there is no need of going,” she said.

The Fourth Medium Term Plan is the last five-year Medium Term Plan of the Kenya Vision 2030 and will transition the country to the next long-term development blueprint.

According to Ms Jumwa, she brought to attention the lack of key projects for Kilifi in the plan.

“Even after the team promised to go back to the National Treasury and review the projects, unfortunately, there is nothing for Kilifi,” she said.

The CS cited the industrial park project that was yet to commence in Kilifi even after the County Government allocated sites.

She said as Kilifi leaders, they expected to see the implementation of different projects in areas where the county government has given land to the national government for development purposes.

“I am wondering why there is nothing for industrial parks in Kilifi while we see the project has started in other regions yet this is a national government programme but not even laying of the foundation stone has been done. It should not be that every time there is no money in Kilifi we are told there is no money,” she added.

The Gender Cabinet Secretary said the County government had released land in Kayafungo in Kaloleni and Gongoni in Magarini Sub-counties for the construction of industrial parks.

Ms Jumwa said the national government was also not clear on the allocations of the cashew nut and coconut crops that are of great economic value to the people of Kilifi.

In addition, she said the national government has failed to consider dairy farming in Kilifi where the county had the potential to produce milk for the commercial sector, as well as the Blue Economy.

However, Ms Jumwa stated that she was happy that the County Commissioner and the County Government were able to address the issues on land that was allocated for the affordable housing project.

Nairobi County misses revenue target of Sh19.9 billion,"The Nairobi County Government, under the leadership of Governor Johnson Sakaja, will not meet its revenue target for the Financial Year 2023/2024, which is Sh19.9 billion.

While the governor was optimistic about achieving his target based on changes introduced since he took office, the county is missing the target by Sh7 billion.

The County Chief Officer in charge of Revenue Administration, Mr Wilson Gakuya, reveals that even if the county fails to meet the target, it will still record the highest amount collected since the onset of devolution.

Mr Gakuya said that based on projections of the revenue streams, the county will surpass the highest source revenue recorded under the leadership of Dr Evans Kidero when he was in charge of the county.

""We are already at about Sh12 billion with a few days left in the month. The worst case scenario is that we will surpass the highest target during Governor Kidero's time of Sh12 billion and be able to collect Sh13 billion,"" said Mr Gakuya. In an interview, the Chief Officer stated that while the county will miss its target, the upward trajectory in terms of performance is promising.

""The structures we've put in place are what's going to make it happen.

By the time we get to the next financial year, it will be better because of the structures that have been put in place.""

The county revealed that the introduction of the Unified Business Permit, which was meant to consolidate licenses, has borne fruit as residents can now pay their rates without having to wait as long as before.

""We are doing well but we are not where we should be, the signs are there with continuous improvements, and that is why we can collect the highest revenue that has ever been collected in Nairobi.""

Mr Gakuya attributes the success to the controversial revenue collection system known as the Nairobi Revenue System (NRS), developed by the government and used since the defunct Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS).

This comes amidst a pending report from the Nairobi County Assembly Ad-hoc Committee, which was set up to investigate the system following allegations that revenues have been dwindling since the county adopted the system.

""We are not here to defend the system, but as the Nairobi County Revenue Authority, my interest would be to adopt a system that can help me mobilise as much revenue as possible. We have to look at the bigger picture. Our system is one that the Nairobi County government has no problem using. It is a super system. By the end of March this year, the county had collected Sh9.4 billion in parking fees, single business permits, building permits and approvals, build boards, and advertisements leading in revenue collection.

Also, they said the recent floods which saw the governor suspend excavating and new buildings, and the free-parking weekends as the reasons why they did not meet the target.

“The idea (free parking on weekends) was to encourage all Nairobians to come to town on weekends knowing that there will be no harassment from the inspectorate, and knowing they won’t pay and to do their business. By doing their business, the economy thrives. We must see the impact that it has on the global economy.”

Junior Starlets put one foot in World Cup,"Kenya has put one foot in the 2024 Fifa Under-17 Women’s World Cup after a 3-0 victory over Burundi yesterday in the fourth round of the qualifiers played at Abebe Bikila Stadium in Addis Ababa.

The return leg match will take place at Ulinzi Sports Complex in Nairobi this Sunday, with the team expected to jet back to the country on Monday and proceed directly to camp at Stadion Hotel in Nairobi.

To secure their World Cup spot this scoreline means that Kenya needs a draw of any kind, a win or to prevent conceding more than three goals when they host Burundi.

Striker Lorna Faith was the first to see the back of the net to score a goal in the 11th minute before midfielder Marion Serenge doubled the lead in the 43rd minute, granting Kenya an advantage in the opening half.

In the second half, Burundi could not come back to life as Starlets coach Mildred Cheche added salt to injury by introducing midfielder Susan Akoth, who scored a third goal in the 71st minute to give all the maximum points away from home.

Cheche made two changes to the starting lineup and it proved successful. She changed the final third and midfield and maintained the goalkeeper and defense from the squad that played in the previous match against Ethiopia at Ulinzi Complex last month, a game that Kenya won 3-0 on aggregate in the third round of the qualifiers.

Goalkeeper Velma Abwire remained in goal, supported by defenders super captain Elizabeth Ochaka, Christine Adhiambo, Kimberly Akinyi, and Lorine Ilavonga.

In the midfield, Rebbeca Odato swapped positions with Serenge, as Odato played as a midfielder and Serenge as an attacker.

In the attacking force, strikers Joan Ogola and Valarie Nekesa were benched for Quinter Adhiambo and Lorna Faith.

Kenya had received a bye in the first round but proceeded to the second round to face the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), who later withdrew from the tournament before kicking a ball.

On the other hand, Burundi also received a bye in the first round but faced Botswana in the second round, winning 4-1 on aggregate, and then emerged victorious against Djibouti with a 24-0 aggregate score in the third round.

In other matches across Africa, Zambia triumphed 3-1 over Morocco on Saturday at Heroes Stadium in Lusaka, Zambia on Saturday, June 8.

Zambian striker Namute Chileshe in the 13th, 24th, and the 82nd minutes. Morocco’s consolidation goal came from Azraf Kautar in the 37th minute.

Elsewhere, Liberia was to host Nigeria on Sunday evening at Samuel Kanyon Stadium in Liberia.

Three top teams from the qualifiers from the CAF region will represent Africa in the World Cup as 16 teams from six confederations will battle on the biggest stage. World Cup tournament that will be held in the Dominican Republic from October 16 to November 3, 2024.

Who stole an infant's body and carried it away naked?,"Shock and panic gripped a family in Kamhinda Village, Komenya-Kowala sub-location in Siaya County after they woke up to an empty grave of their infant son 10 days after his burial.

Joseph Ochieng Origi lost his newborn son on May 28 just three hours after his wife delivered at Siaya County Referral Hospital.

“We carried the body and buried it within my compound but on Friday we woke up to find his grave wide open and the body missing,” said Mr Origi.

Mr Origi said that the bizarre incident has sent his family into confusion and panic.

“We were beginning to heal because that is all we could do. However, someone coming to carry the corpse at night is something that has sent chills down our spines,” he explained.

Origi said that up to this moment, they were yet to establish the motive behind the theft in the dead of the night.

Mr Origi disclosed that the child developed breathing complications right after birth before he died at the county referral hospital.

He said that what scared them even more was the realisation that the body was carried away naked. The clothes that they dressed the infant in were found next to the grave.

“It’s a nightmare, everything that the baby wore was left behind including his socks,"" he said.

The matter was reported at Mwer Police post and detectives have launched investigations into the matter.

The child passed away before being named hence hospital records only identify him as an infant of Mr and Mrs Origi.

In the Luo community, according to Mzee Christopher Awuondo, a grave is very important because people believe in the living dead.

“The presence of that grave within the homestead is significant because it’s a constant reminder to the living that once upon a time their kin lived with them. That is why graves would be created and banana stems or Yago buried to signify a grave,” he says.

Why did someone steal the body of an infant and carry it away naked? That is the puzzle the family and the entire village of Kamhinda can’t figure out.

Terrorism survivor who lost leg and eye yet to get compensation,"A decade later, a devastating explosion incident still plays in Simon Kinyua’s mind.

On that fateful day in 2014, Mr Kinyua had boarded a matatu from the Nairobi's Central Business District to Githurai. Little did he know that this would be the last time he would use his legs.

As they approached Roasters restaurant along Thika Superhighway there was a loud bang.

His mind went blank. For several minutes, he was unconscious, and upon regaining consciousness, he witnessed some passengers alighting while screaming.

“Several passengers remained inside the vehicle; they thought we were dead. I cried out for help, hoping to be rescued. When I looked at my right leg, I saw only bones,” he recalls.

A Good Samaritan volunteered to take him and other victims to St. Francis-Mwiki Hospital. He recalls that during the journey, he could hardly see. His vision was blurred.

“When I heard the doctor's voice, I asked him, 'How long will this pain last?' only for the doctor to inform me that I was going to undergo an operation. That is how they amputated my leg and I also lost my right eye,” Kinyua recalls.

He was taken for surgery without his relatives knowing his whereabouts as he had not made any calls to inform them about the accident. His wife, Mrs Edith Kinyua, who had arrived in town on the evening of the accident from upcountry, did not know her husband’s situation.

The following morning, she decided to visit the scene to search for her husband after hearing about the accident on the news.

“My husband had told me earlier that we would meet at home. When I arrived in Nairobi and called him, he didn't pick up something that left me worried about his whereabouts,” Mrs Kinyua said.

10 years later, Mrs Kinyua is always worried whenever she calls her husband and finds him unreachable.

“In the morning, I went to the scene and was informed that the victims were taken to St. Francis-Mwiki Hospital where I went to search for him and by good luck, I met him there,” recounts Mrs Kinyua.

There was a conflict at the hospital between the government and the private hospital as the government declined to pay the hospital demanding all the victims be transferred to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).

“The tension came about when the deposit that was required for my eye surgery was delayed by the government,” adds Kinyua.

According to the doctor at St. Francis Mwiki- hospital, his left eye could be corrected through surgery. This was therefore delayed until when the chief officer at Kasarani Police Station intervened leading to a successful transfer to KNH.

At KNH, Kinyua stayed for another week without eye surgery due to an unpaid bill from the government that was supposed to cater for his surgery.

“The government only paid a deposit of Sh45,000 which was not enough prompting the hospital management to ask all the victims of the explosion to register again. That day I left the hospital worried about losing the eye that had not yet been operated on. I knew my sight would be lost if I wasn't attended to promptly,” Kinyua explained.

However, he sought medical attention at a private hospital that helped him regain his sight. “The ups and downs at KNH would have made me lose my sight if it was not for a friend who took me to a private hospital that helped me regain sight in one eye,” he said.

Mr Kinyua now struggling to feed his family, is calling on the government for compensation. In a poignant narrative, he recounts the harrowing incident and the enduring challenges he has faced since that fateful day, highlighting the long-term impact of the tragedy on his life and the lives of his fellow passengers.

Read: Corrupt legal system a tragedy for accident victims

After 10 years, Kinyua has not received any communication regarding compensation and justice. He complained of being shuffled from one department to another.

“My efforts to get justice have been futile. I have been moving from one office to another without any clear communication,” says Kinyua.

According to police reports, the perpetrators of the incident were imprisoned, something that keeps Kinyua wondering why his compensation has been delayed even after getting all the documents required.

“The last communication I received was that the car owner has not come forward,” reiterates Kinyua. “I have a family that depends on me. This incident left me disabled and unable to do anything for my family,” Kinyua recounts after the car he was travelling in was bombed.

At that time, he had one hope that he wished God would fulfill.

“I prayed very hard not to die. I wanted to see my two children and my beloved wife,” says Kinyua.

Terrorist bombings were on the rise then.

Kinyua says, there was neglect as there was no thorough inspection of the passengers’ luggage before boarding despite the imminent threat of terrorism.

Israel-Hamas War: Palestinian death toll in hostage rescue raid rises to 274,"Cairo

Israeli forces pounded central Gaza anew on Sunday, a day after killing 274 Palestinians during a hostage rescue raid, and tanks advanced into further areas of Rafah in a bid to seal off part of the southern city, residents and Hamas media said.

Palestinians remained in shock over Saturday's death toll, the worst over a 24-hour period of the Gaza war for months and including many women and children, Palestinian medics said.

In an update on Sunday, Gaza's health ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed - up from 210 it reported on Saturday - and 698 were injured when Israeli special force commandos stormed into the densely populated Al-Nuseirat camp to rescue four hostages held since October by Hamas militants.

Israel's military said a special forces officer was killed in exchanges of fire with militants emerging from cover in residential blocks, and that it knew of ""under 100"" Palestinians killed, though not how many of them were militants or civilians.

On Sunday, three Palestinians were killed and several hurt in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Al-Bureij in the central Gaza Strip, while tanks shelled parts of nearby Al-Maghazi and Al-Nuseirat. All are built-up, historic refugee camps.

The Israeli military said in a statement its forces were continuing operations east of Bureij and the city of Deir al-Balah in the centre of the coastal enclave, killing several Palestinian gunmen and destroying militant infrastructure.

Israel sent forces into Rafah in May in it called a mission to wipe out Hamas' last intact combat units after eight months of war in which Israeli forces have bombed much of the rest of Gaza to rubble while advancing against fierce resistance.

Israeli tank forces have since seized Gaza's entire border strip with Egypt running through Rafah to the Mediterranean coast and invaded several districts of the city, prompting around one million displaced people who had been sheltering in Rafah to flee elsewhere.

On Sunday, tanks advanced into two new districts in an apparent effort to complete the encirclement of the entire eastern side of Rafah, touching off clashes with dug-in Hamas-led armed groups, according to residents trapped in their homes.

As of June 5, all but around 100,000 displaced people who took refuge in eastern Rafah after fleeing Israeli offensives further north in Gaza had left, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.

""All UNRWA shelters in Rafah have been vacated. Many of the people who were based in Rafah have fled up the coast seeking safer locations in both Khan Younis and the middle area (of Gaza),"" UNRWA said in a statement.

Palestinian medics said an Israeli airstrike on a house in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah killed two people.

The Israeli military said troops of its 162nd division were raiding some districts of Rafah where they had located ""numerous additional terror tunnel shafts, mortars, and (other) weapons"" belonging to Palestinian Islamist militants.

Hamas precipitated the war with a lightning cross-border attack into Israel last October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed during a brief November truce.

Israel's ensuing air and ground war in Gaza has killed at least 37,084 Palestinians, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said in its Sunday update. The ministry says thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.

Attempts by the United States and regional countries to broker a deal that would release all remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire have repeatedly stumbled on Israeli and Hamas intransigence over terms for an end to the war.

Gaza's conflict has destabilised the wider Middle East, drawing in Hamas' main backer Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah which has been clashing with Israel along its northern border for months, raising fears of all-out war.

Kikiko land row deepens as rival factions hold parallel polls,"The battle for control of the Sh100 billion Kibiko Keekonyokie Land Trust in Kajiado West Sub-county, Kajiado County, has intensified following the holding of parallel elections by rival factions.

On Tuesday last week, one wing declared long-serving chairman Moses Parantai as the winner while the other group elected Mr Moses Monik.

Kajiado County Commissioner Joseph Taari had cancelled the elections and cordoned off the ground citing security concerns. However, the Monik team held another election on Friday as per the gazette notice they had published in local newspapers.

At least 9, 000 Keekonyokie members are said to have taken part in the exercise. The group boasts of at least 16,000 members. Voting took place from 8am to 4pm, after which the returning officer declared Mr Monik as the chairperson. The Iseuri Mas elders (aged between 85 and 95 years) and religious leaders witnessed the polls.

""We have followed the procedures necessary for convening an AGM [annual general meeting]. Our elections have been conducted according to the law,"" Mr John Kiok, an outgoing interim trustee, said. His sentiments were echoed by another trustee, Mr Julius Ngomea who emphasised the need to follow the rule of law regarding matters pertaining to the Keekonyokie Trust Land

Mr Monik pledged to serve all members without discrimination. He further castigated his competitors for trying to incite members against each other by holding parallel polls.

""Members have spoken through credible polls. This marks the end of the wrangles and the two factions have become one unit. I promise to uphold justice and transparency in sub-dividing the land,” said Mr Monik. An Environment and Land Court sitting in Kajiado had on April 4 ordered the group to elect new trustees within 90 days.

Road to UHC: Two sides of the Universal Health Coverage coin – the supply side,"A healthcare expert remarked that Universal Health Coverage (UHC) conversations up to this point have focused on the demand side, spotlighting the 2.75% deductions, with little discussion of the supply side.

For quality service delivery, robust health infrastructure, and adequate human resources for health and commodities security are required. Over 400 rural health facilities recently rejected National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) cards over Sh6bn debt. Patients were required to pay out of pocket. Faith-based hospitals also decried over SH2Bn debt.

While the appointed Social Health Act Authority (SHAA) confirmed that the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) would process pending claims submitted to NHIF, health providers are apprehensive. Professional Associations have remarked that debts ought to be settled first. Previously, we highlighted key statements from the gazetted Social Health Insurance Act Regulations. Two big questions on Benefits and Tariffs remain central in determining how members can utilize the three Social Health Insurance Act funds.

Therefore, the Authority would be required to contract health facilities and providers, both within and outside Kenya, who would be part of their approved list of service providers, in a process known as empanelment.

Podcast: A breakdown of medical insurance in Kenya

It is expected that in these contracts would be terms, and conditions, following approval of tariffs. Health service providers would be required to submit claims to SHIF for review, approval, and payment within seven days. For specialised services, those not documented or for members who’ve surpassed limits, a pre-authorisation request would be required before offering services. Emergency services are exempt from these restrictions. Facilities and providers will be onboarded to a centralized digital platform, eliminating paperwork, and allowing for real-time processing and efficiency in operations.

Unlike in the past, where debts owed to health service providers have accumulated over the years, the claims process would be optimized for fast payment of providers.

Potentially, these might signify health facility boycotts would be a thing of the past. A clause within the regulations provides for the Authority to outsource claims processing in case of any bottlenecks. The third-party claims management providers would be limited to operating within zones and cannot process claims for more than three counties.

The digital platforms would also curb fraud cases that plagued the now defunct NHIF.

It is expected health service providers would be vigilant in seeking authorization or in submission of claims, to mitigate the risk of claims rejection. Some of the common errors would include offering services in a higher-level facility or outside Kenya without a referral form, not capturing biometrics or information required in the claims form, and specialized services without preauthorization, amongst others. This might explain an extra layer of administration that patients might have to undergo while seeking services – particularly when seeking care from the different levels of healthcare facilities.

Listen: Fulfilling UHC promise will require private sector

It is expected that healthcare facilities in both public and private sectors would be contracted and as such the key identifier would be the categorization of the facility. That is the classification of the facility, falling between levels 2 to 6, based on services offered, equipment available, and health workers cadre among other prerequisites.

It is important to understand the process health facilities will be subjected to, primarily to ensure the quality of services and efficiencies in the health systems. Perhaps it might also lend an ear to the concerns raised by healthcare providers regarding the need for clarity and systematic implementation of SHIF.

The progress towards Universal Health Coverage will depend on pillars on both the supply and demand side. A system of Universal Healthcare Coverage is essentially an attempt to coordinate and structure the funding, human resources, equipment, and everything else that will be needed to provide UHC so that the burden of health costs does not fall too heavily on any specific person or family.

"‘I use steroids, this is why you shouldn’t’","Several containers with different ingredients carefully sit on the black kitchen table; creatine monohydrate supplement, sea salt, Himalayan pink salt, bicarbonate of soda and half a glass of water.

A topless Antony Gachau Njoroge displaying his buffed broad chest, traps, defined Abs, and vascular muscular arms, adds a pinch of each content to the glass, then stirs and gulps with some sense of urgency.

The short video on TikTok cuts with the 30-year-old throwing a tiny blue pill (Viagra) into his mouth.

“That’s (blend) ideally my pre-workout routine. Viagra is the ultimate pre-workout ever made. It gives you one hell of a pump and a crazy endurance,” Anthony says as we drive to VMX Gym in Nairobi.

The electrical engineer by training isn’t your typical gym rat.

You would easily mistake him for a chemist or a pharmacist or better yet, a biologist. His speech includes vocabularies such as exogenous, endocrine, hypothalamus, anabolic, Trenbolone, Boldenone, and FGF23 (Fibroblast growth factor-23).

What Antony is, is a professional bodybuilder, one who openly uses steroids but is on a crusade to discourage the public from abusing the performance-enhancing drugs (PED) like he does.

As he picks his gym bag from the boot of his car ready for his Friday workout session, Antony swallows another blue pill.

“This is how it works, for the creatine to be effectively absorbed in your blood, three components are involved; Leucine which is an amino acid occurring in our body, sodium and dextrose monohydrate glucose. What Viagra does is to ensure there is enough blood flow to the muscle you are targeting to ensure there is enough supply of oxygen and nutrients. Viagra ensures you get the full benefits of your workout because the muscles are properly fed,” he offers.

According to his research, when Viagra was first made, it was meant to be a drug for hypertension disease.

“Viagra is a PDE5 inhibitor that blocks that very enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5. When that enzyme is blocked, your blood vessels relax, thus they open up more ensuring you get a better delivery of blood to the muscle targeted,” Antony elaborates.

At this point, I am curious and ask if the sustained erections associated with Viagra use affect him.

Antony lets out a loud laugh.

“Not at all, I never get a boner when working out. How can I be thinking of sex whilst I got 200 kilos on the squat rack? Huh! I only use Viagra when going to the gym.”

But why use steroids?

He says he has always been active. His first interaction with weights dates back to his college days at Kenya Polytechnic, now the Technical University of Kenya.

When he didn't have classes to attend, Antony and his college mates would visit the school gym to pass the time.

After graduation in 2019, he found himself more and more in the gym and not long enough after he fell in love with bodybuilding.

“I used to interact a lot with bodybuilders and I could see them ‘juice’ (use steroids) and as a novice, I did what I saw them doing. But that was until 2020 when I began doing my research on steroid use and then applying what I learnt to my routines,” he says.

According to him, a lot of Kenyan bodybuilders secretly abuse PED for fear of public condemnation.

“This whole conversation of PED abuse; as to whether they have used exogenous steroids or not, nothing can be further from the truth. Everybody who is in this bodybuilding industry uses,” Antony claims.

He goes on to emphasise, “Bodybuilding and steroids go hand in hand. Yes, they will tell you bodybuilding is nutrition, proper rest and training, but without the steroids even that nutrition will not be effectively utilised to give you that aesthetic look. I mean, look at my arms, do you think I could have achieved all this vascularity without steroids? Nobody does. The baseline of bodybuilding is basically steroids,” he surmises.

Kidney failure

Antony says he doesn’t imagine himself not abusing steroids for as long as he is into bodybuilding.

“We don’t have to use steroids but having been a natural bodybuilder for seven years, it was time to get to the next level and there began my steroid journey. Think of it as a job promotion or career progression. When you are doing something you are passionate about you will always aspire to move to the next level and for us bodybuilders, we’ve no choice but to hop on steroids,” he says.

How Antony also sees it is that bodybuilders who use steroids are considered to be in a league of their own compared to their natural counterparts. It brings some sense of honour and prestige.

“If you were to line up 10 random gym rats and ask them who is the reigning Mr Natural Olympia (bodybuilding contest), probably no one would know. But ask them, who is the reigning Mr Olympia they will tell you. In my case I would list for you the past 10 winners,” he poses.

Even then,  Antony is fully aware of the many risks he has put himself with death being the ultimate price many bodybuilders have paid.

The thought of developing hypertension due to the abuse of the synthetic man-made version of hormones naturally produced by the adrenal glands scares him, but not as much as losing his kidneys.

“I can’t imagine myself being on dialysis, my kidneys failing is my worst fear and this is why I wouldn’t encourage anyone to go this route. I am putting my life on the line, the risks are quite high but so are the results that come with it. You can hardly come across any opportunities if you don’t take risks. We only live once and it's good you make the best out of it.”

Antony injects himself with steroids almost every day to meet the required weekly dosage. This puts him at a greater risk of kidney failure and hypertension.

“High blood pressure scares every bodybuilder because once you develop HBP that means your kidneys will suffer the most. Unlike the liver which regenerates itself even when destroyed as it works to clear your body, for the kidneys if they are destroyed, that’s it. That means you will be on dialysis especially when old age comes and you can no longer use steroids,” he adds.

Antony, however, adds that he discovered a way of mitigating the risk of running down his kidneys.

“Every side effect of steroid use has a drug cure to it. To ensure I don’t develop hypertension as a result of the steroids I ensure my blood is never thick by taking aspirin after injecting myself with the ‘juice’. I also use high blood pressure medication and now that’s where I go back to Viagra use,” he explains.

Nonetheless, he reiterates his goal is to compete at the very top international levels and no one gets to those stages without the use of steroids.

“Our level of competition you can’t compete without steroids, everybody else is on it, that’s just how the game is played.”

The financial burden

And the steroids don't come cheap.

“These bodies are super expensive bro. To transform my body to be as it is, it’s quite a financial burden. My three months' expenses cost me an average of Sh200,000 just to be able to compete.”

The most common steroids used by bodybuilders, Antony says are testosterone injection, Trenbolone (a steroid used on livestock to increase muscle growth and appetite), boldenone that is administered on horses to enhance muscle growth, endurance and appetite, and masteron.

“Trenbolone is the most loved steroid in Kenyan bodybuilding. Healthwise, it’s a very bad steroid with scary side effects, but it gets the job done. It makes you a god while at the same time robs you of your mental health, you become aggressive, almost bipolar, messes up your kidneys and almost every organ but you’ve got to make some sacrifices for the gains,” he says.

With an upcoming event around the corner in November, Antony plans to use it for muscle gain.

“It gives you proper muscle definition, vascularity, muscle hardness and all the good things. I know I will go mad but I will drop it immediately after the competition,” he says.

Breast surgery

Sometime last year, he developed a bad infection on his right chest muscle that required surgery to correct it. The doctors had to cut open the chest muscle to make an incision and draw out the half-glass abscess (a buildup of pus) that had built up.

The right pectoral muscle developed an abnormal swelling accompanied by excruciating chest pains.

Antony had been injecting himself with the anabolic steroids on the chest muscles to grow them bigger.

“I have acknowledged that I use steroids but I use them with caution and concern. But my chest infection had nothing to do with the steroid but rather hygiene. Anyone injecting compounds to their muscles sometimes due to hygiene issues you tend to transfer dirt into the muscle,” he notes.

He describes the ordeal as a ‘workplace hazard’.

“That’s how I see it, it was an unfortunate event. I had been using a surgical spirit that over time went bad and I hadn’t noticed as I continued using it to sterilise the injected area. That is what got me the infection. A buildup of abscess of about 150 ml was drawn from my chest with the operation,” he says.

Antony’s popular areas of PED injection are the legs, glutes, chest and deltoid muscles.

Disclaimer

As the chat comes to an end he feels compelled to give a disclaimer. He says his sole purpose in opening up is to reveal what goes behind the scenes in the Kenyan bodybuilding world and thus shouldn’t be held responsible for any calamities.

“I am not a doctor, I don’t practice in this area of anabolic steroids. I do not sell steroids. I do not distribute. Sharing my experience is purely for information purposes. And my plea is do not use steroids, they are risky to one’s health with death being the ultimate price you pay,” he concludes.

St Bakhita Chuka Girls' play carries the day,"A play about resilience, hard work, humility and love dominated the unveiling of St Bakhita Chuka Girls High School in Tharaka-Nithi County on Sunday, June 9.

The play entitled Saint Bakhita, directed by Joan Muchina, was performed during the dedication of the new name for the institution.

It told the moving and memorable story of Catholic Saint Josephine Bakhita, a girl kidnapped from Sudan, who rose from slavery to become a Catholic sister and serve God diligently for the rest of her life.

The new name of the school, which includes the saint's name, was chosen by the students of the school, who had expressed a desire to change from the old name of the school to a new one that reflected the virtues that the students wished to emulate.

The school has been at the forefront of both academic and drama at both regional and national levels. The production of Saint Bakhita was just another feather in their cap, having featured prominently in the Eastern Region Drama Festival and the Kenya National Drama Festival this year.

Colourful ceremony

The new name was unveiled in a colourful ceremony led by the Rt Reverend Salesius Mugambi, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Meru, St Bakhita Chuka Girls Principal Joan Muchina and BOM Chairperson Jennifer Mugambi.

The play imaginatively and creatively tells the true story of Bhakita, a girl who was sold into slavery during the later years of the notorious slave trade in the second half of the 19th century.

The audience was taken through the eventful life of Bhakita, who was born in Darfur in 1869 and kidnapped at the age of nine. After being bought and resold five times, the girl was renamed Bhakita by her last buyers, the family of the Italian consul in Khartoum, Sudan.

The consul released her and took her to Italy, where she was baptised in 1890 and joined the Charity Sisters. Her life, as depicted in the play, was dramatic and full of events beyond her control, yet she survived to become a leading servant of the community. She was canonised in 2000 and is the patron saint of Sudan and of survivors of human trafficking.

Rev Mugambi said Africans today suffer from slavery in various forms and guises, from neo-colonialism to the agonising ordeals of Kenyans who travel to the Middle East and other countries in the hope of greener pastures, only to be forced to work in appalling conditions. He urged young people to avoid the lure of easy money as it can lead them into slavery.

""I urge all students as well as teachers, parents and society to emulate the humility of Saint Bhakita who overcame numerous challenges with patience and faith and triumphed in the end,"" the cleric said.

A giant mural

Saint Bhakita in the play was memorably portrayed by Glory Gacheri. Others in the cast were Glory Mueni who played Bhakita's Arabic master, Linn Pendo (Turkish Master), Roxanne Ntingari, Queen Wawira, Joy Nlirote and Blessy Kinya. The cast was directed by Joan Muchina, who is also the school's principal. She revealed that her students chose the name ""Saint Bakhita"" after being inspired by her story.

The ceremony also saw the unveiling of a giant mural of Saint Bakhita on the front wall of the school fence. This year, the school performed a choral verse in the National Drama Festival of Kenya and also excelled in the modern dance category.

The school's chairperson, Jennifer Mugambi, described the school as an embodiment of the new Competency-Based Curriculum, which allows students to excel in academics as well as other areas such as arts and sports.

Second chance? Why MPs are in the spotlight over Finance Bill petitions,"The spotlight is once again on the National Assembly Finance and National Planning Committee over ongoing public participation in the various tax proposals contained in the Finance Bill, 2024, amid worries that most of the input by stakeholders in last year’s Bill was largely ignored in the team’s final decision.

Over 600 stakeholders who have appeared before the Molo MP Kuria Kimani-chaired team have voiced their opposition to the Bill putting the team in the hot seat with a recent Infotrak poll saying four in five Kenyans are opposed to some major tax proposals in the Bill aimed at raising Sh300 billion.

In this years’ Bill, stakeholders have strongly opposed the proposal to introduce 2.5 per cent motor vehicle tax, reclassification of the VAT status of ordinary bread from zero-rated to vatable at 16 per cent and the Amendment of Section 51(2) of the Data Protection Act, which exempts the taxman from data privacy laws.

Removal of tax exemption of capital gains relating to transfer of title of immovable property to a family trust, and the repeal Section 14 of the Excise Duty Act, 2015 (EDA”) that provides for relief of excise duty on raw materials used to make excisable goods have also been a key concern to a majority of stakeholders.

The committee came under heavy criticism last year during consideration of the Finance Bill, 2023 now an Act after brushing aside major concerns raised by various sectors.

In 2023/24 budget issues brought up by stakeholders were raising VAT on petroleum from eight per cent to 16 per cent, housing levy which according to the original Bill was pegged at three per cent of an employee’s basic pay and the increase of income tax to 35 perc ent for those earning above Sh500, 000.

Doubling of VAT

The Kenya Association of Manufacturers projected that at least 16,000 were on the line with the enactment of the Finance Act, 2023 due to introduction of the housing levy and the doubling of VAT to 16 per cent that worsened the business environment for employers.

Passage of the Finance Act, 2023 also saw Matatu Owners Association announce a fare increase of 30 per cent.

Doubling of VAT to 16 per cent that was opposed by all stakeholders last year also saw the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) increasing fuel prices despite a court order stopping implementation of the Act.

“Epra has recalculated the maximum pump prices that will be in force between July 1, 2023 and July 14, 2023 taking into account VAT at 16 per cent,” Epra said in a statement after the President signed the Finance Act, 2023 into law.

Ignoring views of the public also wastes government resources as many bodies rush to court to stop implementation of various acts of the new law.

In the case of the Finance Bill, 2023, Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah and the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) went to court seeking stoppage of implementation of the Act citing various reasons including ignoring public views.

Despite almost all stakeholders rejecting introduction of the Housing levy, the committee only reduced the proposed percentage from three per cent to 1.5 per cent but still retained it in the final report adopted by the House.

The levy, initially proposed as a contributory scheme with an opt-out clause and a refundable savings plan, mutated into an uncapped tax based on gross income, and with no savings or refundable plan.

Also in the final report, the percentage was put at 32.5 per cent for those earning between Sh500, 000 and Sh800, 000 while those earning above Sh800, 000 were slapped with a PAYE rate of 35 per cent up from 30 per cent.

Lawmakers, however, retained the proposal to levy VAT on petroleum products at 16 per cent despite most stakeholders opposing it.

Other taxes that the committee retained despite the majority of stakeholders opposing include the three per cent digital tax, 15 per cent taxation on repatriated profits and the export promotion levy.

The Petroleum Institute of East Africa then submitted to the committee that it was opposed to the VAT increase as it would increase the cost of fuel by Sh12.56 and Sh12.76 per litre of diesel and petrol respectively.

Housing levy

Kenya Airline Pilots Association was among the bodies that opposed the housing levy arguing that most of its members had secured houses.

Article 118 of the Constitution states that “Parliament shall openly conduct its business and its sittings and those of its committees shall be in public and facilitate public participation and involvement in the legislative and other business of parliament and its committees

However, MPs have always turned it into a cosmetic exercise and have often bulldozed unpopular decisions such as the Affordable Housing levy that many stakeholders that appeared before the committee had opposed but was ignored and passed.

There were also proposals to make it voluntary or at least exempt those servicing mortgages.

Calls by stakeholders to retain eight per cent VAT on petroleum products was also rejected and instead the committee adopted the 16 per cent as was proposed in the Bill.

In 2018, the House rejected an eight percent VAT on petroleum products but former President Uhuru had his way after the House failed to veto his memorandum.

Parliament received at least 1,000 memorandum making it the Bill that received most memorandums from the public. Out of the number, 970 stakeholders rejected it but MPs still forced the unpopular decisions.

Plight of Kenyans

Mr Kimani while meeting various stakeholders this week pointed out that the committee was not ignorant of the plight of Kenyans, stressing that it is determined to make the best decision for the country.

“I have always emphasised that public participation is not an exercise in futility, it is enshrined in our Constitution and the aim is to hear as many Kenyans as possible in this particular matter,” Mr Kimani said. He also assured manufacturers that have also opposed the Bill that the committee will make the best decision to support manufacturers in the country.

Read: Poll: Majority of Kenyans opposed to Finance Bill 2024

“I want to assure you that we have all intentions to protect our manufacturers. We want to make Kenya a manufacturing country rather than a trading one”, Mr Kuria said.

On the proposed 2.5 per cent motor vehicle tax that has been opposed by nearly all stakeholders, Mr Kimani said the committee said they will make a decision based on the proposal made before them.

“We have received various proposals like increasing VAT from 16 per cent 17 per cent or increasing prices of petrol by three shillings and these are all options that we will consider. It does mean the tax has to go or stay, we have not made a decision yet and we will make a decision after listening to Kenyans,” Mr Kimani said.

He however expressed concern that while some stakeholders ask for zero rating of their products, they don’t transfer the benefits to their final price of the product or the service.

Committee vice chairman Benjamin Langat said they are not engaged in any public relations exercise assuring stakeholders that their views will be incorporated in the new Bill.

Kwame Owino, the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA-Kenya) Chief executive officer, said it is only MPs who can decide whether public participation is just a cosmetic exercise.

“For us, we were given an opportunity to present and we did that. We hope the committee will consider them,” Mr Owino said.

Ignoring public views and voting in euphoria have led to many MPs later realising some of the punitive taxes contained in the Bill.

At Under the Swahili Tree by Lake Naivasha,"‘I think this is a special place,’ Emma Forbes said, as she welcomed us to her new Under the Swahili Tree restaurant by Naivasha Lake.

“And it’s been an adventure,’’ she added. Within a few days of the opening, the heavy rains came, the water level rose, and the place was in rather than by the lake.

Just describing where it is along the Moi South Lake Road, I cannot do better than quoting the directions that was given to us: ‘it’s about 30 seconds from the junction with the Naivasha Road. Look for a purple gate with the Boffar Farm sign, between Blooming Suites and Party Island. Drive down the lane and park on the grass by the Kentwood. Walk up the footpath and hop on a boat!’

True. A small boat was waiting for guests, and the boatman punted us for about 200 metres of shallow water that had been a lawn until the rains came, up to a new long boardwalk.

Yes, it is a very special place. We had our lunch on the Pelican Deck, looking out over the waters to the blue hills in the distance and listening to the calls of a Sea Eagle. The menu is different from that of Emma’s Under the Swahili Tree in Karen, Nairobi. As you would expect, there are a number of fish dishes. You can have, for example, Naivasha Tilapia, ugali and greens with coconut sauce, or Swahili Snapper Curry, with chapati, rice and kachumbari.

Popular English dish

Knowing that Emma is English and that fish and chips is such a popular English dish that is what I tried – to see how it matched up with what I so often had in England. It matched up very well. The batter was crisp and the fish fell away in delicious white flakes. The chips were even better than the usual English ones, because they were tasty French fries!

Lut enjoyed the Halloumi burger with chimichurri and fries. Next time, I think I will try the Swahili BBQ chicken skewers with fries and dragon fruit kachumbari. You can also have BBQ pork ribs, cheese burgers, or bratwurst hotdogs.

Emma explained that the bricks for making the pizza oven that had been brought from Nairobi were under water, so pizzas won’t be added to the menu till the water level goes down. Fortunately, the restaurant is firmly built on stilts; otherwise it would have been a disaster rather than what Emma calls an adventure. As it is, there was a good number of guests that Sunday lunchtime – a group that mirrored Nairobi’s racial mix.

Certainly, the prices should not put people off, because they are reasonable – averaging about Sh1,500 . An excellent house wine was Sh600, and a glass of beer was only Sh250 .

Emma joined us for lunch; it was refreshing to be talking with someone who is so energetic, creative and confident. She argued that it is a great advantage that the restaurant is so close to the main Naivasha Road, because it is more accessible than other places further down Moi South Lake Road – and not in competition with them.

Swahili Tree

She is even offering a business lunch menu, which could be attractive to people working at the flower farms along the road or even people driving out from Naivasha Town.

Within a week or so, the Under the Swahili Tree will have another initiative along the lane leading to the Pelican Deck. This is a campsite called the Lagoon, with a cheaper ‘two sausages type’ restaurant, showers and access to a swimming pool.

For people at both sites, boat rides on the lake are available.

For us, it was a very pleasant long lunchtime at the Pelican Deck. We didn’t see Pelicans, but there were Cormorants perching on the skeletal trees out on the lake, the sun was glittering on the ripples of the water, and the Fish Eagles were still calling.

If Emma does the sort of things she does at the Karen restaurant, there will be always something new Under the Swahili Tree by Lake Naivasha.

Why couples become more alike over time,"Another possibility is that you met, fell in love, and changed your attitudes and beliefs to try to fit together better. And that continued over the years

You’ve probably noticed it yourself. Over the long term, you and your spouse seem to be growing more alike. Your likes and dislikes, emotions and health gradually converging.

You never become identical of course. But the way you each react to the world slowly becomes more similar. You start to like the same smells and tastes, your hormone levels begin to harmonise, and so does your response to stress. That’s not all to the good, though. Because, for example, whoever’s happier tends to become more discontented as the other gets more cheerful!

Maybe this all happens because we generally date people who are similar to us in the first place. You probably met each other because you were about the same age, enjoyed doing the same things, and had similar preferences, backgrounds and education. And if you already had a lot in common, it’s likely that you went on changing in similar ways over time.

Read: Here’s the recipe for a long and happy marriage

Or maybe you became more like each other because you spend so much time together, do a whole lot of stuff together, and like talking to the same people.

Another possibility is that convergence is just something that helps couples to connect early on. You met, fell in love, and changed your attitudes and beliefs to try to fit together better. And that continued over the years.

Or perhaps it’s all an illusion. Maybe you just feel that you’re becoming more alike, though actually you’re not. That’s certainly possible, because happy couples tend to assume that they both see things the same way. So if you’re worried about something, you want to believe that your partner also shares your concerns. That might not actually be true, but acknowledging it could cause conflict, or make you wonder whether perhaps you’re not with the right person.

So you stick with the easier option, especially as when you feel that you and your partner are seeing eye to eye on something, you tend to feel closer to one another.

Read: How wild spousal expectations destroy marriages

You don’t need to be similar to your partner in everything, of course, nor should you try to be. If one of you tends to get stressed easily, for example, it helps if the other tends to remain calm. Or if one of you tends to feel insecure, having a more secure partner can really help you to become more trusting. But despite all that, if you feel similar to one another, you feel more in love. Even if it’s all really just an illusion!

And there are usually a few very real differences between long-term couples, as you probably know all too well. What matters is that you and your spouse feel connected and understood, so that you can support each other and build your relationship. Recognising each other’s individual quirks also means that you can work on the things that make you unhappy. So that together, you can both change in ways that help you to become better people.

"David Thuo, the recreational runner on a 90km record-breaking marathon","David Thuo’s BMW car boot could be mistaken for an elite sports club locker room. Several pairs of the latest Nike racing shoes here, bottles of meticulously mixed hydration fluids there, a training mat, packed full-nutrient meals, running apparel…

What strikes me, in particular, is his rich repertoire of Nike racing shoes.

“The shoe that you have raced in shouldn’t be the shoe that you train in,” Thuo explains his multiple shoe collection, with each pair’s mileage clocked well documented on a running app.

“I have to have different shoes because they wear out differently. You need to have a shoe that is about to wear out, like this one that’s about to go off…this one is the one I have been training in for the Comrade’s Marathon, and this is the one I will run the Comrades Marathon with, and so I’ve started using it so that by the time I’m doing the Comrades Marathon the shoe will probably have covered 120 to 150 kilometres,” he says.

“These have done about 400 kilometres… I track them on (running app) Strava… and this is the one I ran with at the Tokyo Marathon. By the time I ran in Tokyo, the shoes had covered about 80 kilometres,” he says, taking me through the reasoning behind the several pairs of Nike racing shoes in his possession after an early morning run in Nairobi’s Karen.

“These are for the easy runs, I’m about to phase them off, and this is the main shoe for training now while this one is for the Comrades Marathon. By the time I’ve done the Comrades Marathon, it will be going to 200 kilometres, and then I will do another 200 kilometres with it and by that time I will get another pair as I prepare for the Sydney Marathon in September,” he says.

The shoe is a critical part of training because it takes eight times your body weight, so if you have worn-out shoes, you risk injury a lot.

“Because I’m also running on 100 percent tarmac, the shoes are a very critical part of my training,” he adds.

Such is Thuo’s attention to detail that even surpasses that of many Kenyan elite runners, even those with direct, lucrative shoe sponsorship from sportswear giants like Nike, Adidas, or Asics.

The Comrades Marathon that Thuo is talking about is happening today, Sunday, June 9.

It is a 90-kilometre challenge in South Africa and the world’s oldest ultra-marathon race traditionally run between the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg. It is one of the world’s most challenging ultra-marathon races.

Thuo is among a group of over 50 runners from East Africa, including over 30 from Kenya, 25 from Uganda and five from Tanzania, running in today’s Comrades Marathon.

Fifth time

It will be the fifth appearance at the Comrades Marathon for the 48-year-old Thuo, the owner and CEO of Dathon Ace, a Wilson Airport-based company that overhauls aircraft components for aircraft companies in Kenya and the East African region.

Thuo’s love for running also sees him operate the “Fitness with David” outfit that seeks to help individuals and corporates in Kenya and beyond to develop the best version of themselves through running.

“I have a motto ‘to inspire through running.’ Health is your biggest wealth because when that fails, nothing else matters,” he explains as he cools down from the morning run at a 3.2 kilometres “Vienna Loop” route he mapped out and named around Nairobi’s Karen Plains Road, Begonia Drive, Farah Road and Forest View Road.

In March this year, Thuo joined the exclusive “Six-Star Club” of runners that have completed all six, famous World Marathon Majors (WMM) races in Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York.

In Tokyo, he was among a group that set a Guinness World Record for ‘the most Six Star Finishers on a single day’, sailing past the 10,000 mark for total members of the ‘Six Star Hall of Fame.’

“Standing at any of our medal presentation areas always offers a reminder of the power of these six races, and what it means to the runners when they complete their journey,” Thuo reflects.

“The culmination of achieving something so amazing that so few have done is incredible—the journey of commitments, staying true to your dreams. Now I feel absolutely amazing and ecstatic. It’s all about the attitude in the waiting room—clapping for others waiting my turn,” he says.

At the Tokyo Marathon in March, nearly 3,000 medals were given out at the finish line to athletes who had completed all six majors, with Thuo completing the race in two hours, 38 minutes, and 59 seconds. Quite impressive for a recreational runner.

“My number one goal was to get over this “six-star” hurdle in Tokyo and to do it in under three hours, which is a recreational runner’s dream. I just came from running my second fastest time in the Valencia Marathon of 2:47:00 in December last year.”

Many of the runners participating in the Tokyo record had waited for this moment since first earning a place in the 2020 race, which was reduced to an elite-only field as the Covid-19 pandemic curtailed international travel and mass participation events all over the world.

“Runners continued to wait through 2021 and 2022 before travel restrictions for Japan were relaxed to allow overseas visitors to enter the country,” explains Thuo, who missed an e-mail that had gone to his junk folder containing his official invitation to last year’s Tokyo Marathon.

Prepping

He describes his running and work ethic, as a meticulous attention to detail.

“When I go home in the evening, I pack my hydration fluids for the following morning’s run,” he explains his daily routine.

“I use Maurten, which is the same hydration fluid elite like Eliud Kipchoge use. I mix the drinks depending on the distance. I do about 140 to 150 kilometres a week and when you put in so much work, a wrong drink can mess up with your entire training of weeks and months,” he adds.

“I don’t buy food because I want to eat something specific to my training,” he says, displaying his food bag that contains a protein drink for post-run recovery, eggs and vegetables, an evening snack and lunch with protein, vegetables, chapati and arrowroot. People ask me what I eat, I eat very little but very efficiently and properly,” he says.

He has ticked every training day (the micro wins on the way to the macro wins) despite a heavy work schedule.

“I am a business owner working 18 hours a day, but, luckily, I get to choose which 18 hours I work,” he says.

The difference between him and the elite athletes, he says, is that he has to go to work during the day.

“They will run, then sleep. But I’ve got a very busy job so when I get to work, I must focus,” explains Thuo whose regime sees him off to sleep by 8.30 pm, waking up by 3 am each day for his morning workouts.

Just how does Thuo juggle work, training and global marathons?

“A person's life needs to be holistic, and it is composed of many elements. I look at them [marathons] as the various aspects of wellness; physical, intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual, vocational, financial, and environmental. Of course, when it's a busy season of, say, work, family, training or as the case may be, one or a few could override the others but then when that eases off, you give to the others. I am, however, very clear. I am the goose that lays the golden egg, and I can't give what I don't have. I fill my cup first so that I have something to offer others. I, therefore, come first, and all else is second. This is how I look at things. Anything in the way of that then we have a problem,” he says.

So, what next for Thuo after completing the “six-star” in Tokyo?

“We say one finish line ushers you to the start run of another,” he says, “I am also the kind of person who believes there is always another level. That's why even with the delayed six-star, I still kept doing a lot.”

His target is to get to run in 10 Comrades Marathon editions and earn what they call a “green number.”

“Then who knows, I may shoot for 15, maybe 20. Barry Holland has run 48 of them (as of last year). Fathom that! I turn 48 this year. He has run 90 kilometres each year of the years I will have lived this year,” Thuo says.

Then there is the upcoming World Marathon Majors’ seventh star-eligible race in Sidney in September. Because of his speed seeding based on age, he has an automatic qualification to Sydney.

“There is so much to do in all spheres of life… we go to bed tired but grateful, but wake up hungry for the next level if we are driven and not mediocre,” he says.

To Thuo, running is indeed a metaphor for life.

“We draw life’s lessons from running. Even with all things aligned, you don’t always succeed, but the effort is not always in vain. The metaphor for life is discipline, consistency, focus, mental fortitude and learning from what doesn’t work,” he says.

Mucui: The Kenyan youngster eyeing success in Polish league,"Pursuing your dream in a different country comes with struggles and challenges.

For 24-year-old Kenyan footballer Cedric Mucui, pursuing football career in Poland has come with the challenge of adapting to new language, extreme weather conditions in the Baltic region, new food, and the excitement of meeting new people.

The sacrifices he has made to overcome these challenges, the left winger and central attacking midfielder says, what motivate him to keep going. Mucui currently plays for Talent Warszawa, a club based in Polish capital city Warsaw, and plays in the lower-tier league V. liga.

“In Poland, I played for Wilga Garwolin in the (fourth-tier league) 4liga where I signed my first contract for a year but I later moved to my current club Talent Warszawa, where I hope to finish the rest of my first season in Poland,” the first born in a family of three siblings told Nation Sport on phone from Warsaw yesterday.

Born and raised in Kenya, Mucui’s love affair with football started at a young age, his parents providing him with the necessary support to achieve his dream. For the Manchester United diehard fan, every kick of the ball carried a promise of greatness.

When he was 16, he took the crucial step of enrolling in Nairobi-based football academy called True Talents of Africa.

At the time, he was a high school student at Nova Pioneer, where he was surrounded by players with similar talent and aspirations.

For him, balancing football and school wasn’t as hard because the True Talents of Africa programme is integrated with the school programme so he would train on weekends and holidays.

“When I joined True Talents of Africa, the goal was pursue opportunities in the United States of America, Romania, Poland, Spain, and in the United Kingdom. True Talents of Africa seemed the real deal, and knew how the process works. I knew the director in person, so my trust had been won either way,” Mucui, who idolises Brazilian star Neymar, says.

He is privileged to have attended trials sessions with 2009 Kenyan league champions Sofapaka, but he was not lucky to be signed up.

During his time at True Talents of Africa, he showcased his potential and won the admiration of his coaches who helped him polish his skills.



This was a big move for him because as some of his friends continued with their education journey to university level, he took the risk to pursue football.

“One of the key achievements at my time in True Talents of Africa was winning the (age-group) Ligi Ndogo East African Cup in 2022.

“As a product of True Talents Africa, the Academy will always hold a special place in my heart,” he says.

He was meant to head to the United States of America on a sports scholarship but his application for travel visa was turned down twice.

“I chose a different country to continue my dream of playing abroad and with the help of the academy and its partners I ended up in an academy and agency in Poland called Sportsmate which helped me market myself ability-wise to the Polish market, and to secure a team in 4liga Poland. Later, I moved to another team in 5liga in the winter,” he says.

In future, Mucui hopes to play for the senior men’s national football team Harambee Stars.

"Women lead the way in octopus fishing, reaping bumper rewards","Tucked on the Eastern side of Lamu’s biggest island —  Pate — is a small, remote village known as Shanga Ishikani. It is one of the 10 villages that make up the Pate Marine Community Conservancy. A walk through the village reveals little infrastructure and activity, a stark contrast to the bustling mainland.

The main economic activity here revolves around the sea. There aren’t many opportunities, particularly for women, but the narrative is changing.

Amina Ahmed, a 40-year-old mother of five, has lived here all her life, taking care of her family and homestead. Like all the women in the village, Amina’s livelihood was for a long time dependent on fishermen, the traditional breadwinners. But today she is claiming that title —  she is a fisherwoman.

With just two long wooden spears and a bucket, her equipment is minimal, but sufficient. As we walk towards the ocean, Amina asks locals to join us even as we wait for a boat to arrive. Today is a special day that everyone has been waiting for —  it’s the octopus harvesting day.

About 15 minutes into the journey, unusual objects — bouys — stick out of the water, swaying to the rhythm of the ocean. Amina explains that these are boundary markers of a critical and protected zone called Ijamba Idodi in Ndo Pate within the Pate Marine Community Conservancy.  Here, fishing is restricted to certain times of the year, like today. So important is this zone that rangers, young men drawn from the community, have been employed to patrol it.

The high tide is receding and we head to the meeting area, where everyone is patiently waiting for the octopus fishing grounds to be opened. The grounds are normally closed off temporarily to allow the octopuses to grow.  “It’s our day to open the octopus closure. I am happy because I was chosen by the community to lead them in this venture and given the title ‘Mama Pweza’ —  mother octopus,”  says Amina.

Amina has earned the name because she has been leading a number of women in octopus fishing to sustain their livelihoods. Octopus is a healthy food that is extremely rich in many nutrients known to support optimal human health, but it also one of the hardest to catch because it is considered the most intelligent of all invertebrates. It has a head and eight arms, each with its own brain.

For years, the residents of Shanga Ishikani had struggled to make ends meet. They relied heavily on this area in Ndo Pate for seafood, but it became degraded, resulting in declining fish populations.

Mr George Maina, the Africa Fisheries Strategy Manager at The Nature Conservancy, an organisation that seeks to safeguard productive marine and freshwater fisheries, says this was a man-made problem, citing destructive fishing practices. “The use of illegal fishing gears is very common. There is also over-fishing of some key species, and this is as a result of weak management and governance of community institutions and other institutions in charge of fisheries”.

The drop in the fish catch took a toll on livelihoods. But in April 2018, the tides started turning when an opportunity arose for locals to go on a benchmarking trip to Madagascar to learn about best fishing practices and the benefits of octopus farming, thanks to The Nature Conservancy and other stakeholders such as the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT).

Hassan Yusuf, the Coast regional director of NRT, says farming octopuses was a viable option to explore due to their biological and ecological characteristics. “They mature fast, have a short lifespan of between 18-24 months, lay many eggs hence have a high survival rate, and they also have short movements. So you don’t require a big area to establish an octopus closure.”

The community realised that the venture could change their fortunes.

On the trip to Madagascar was Mahmoud Madi, the chairperson of the Pate Marine Community Conservancy, which aims at improving livelihoods through conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. “We asked the octopus farmers in Madagascar what had made them succeed. They said the first thing was that Beach Management Units had come together, and the second thing was women being on the frontline. They have a women’s association, and we replicated this back home. We trained our women and they started leading the way in octopus farming revolution.”

Science was critical in determining the location and size of the octopus closure. In December 2018, the women set aside 115 hectares. Three Beach Management Units came together and developed their own fisheries co-management plans and by-laws. But there was a catch. For this to work, the closures would be out of bounds for four months to allow the octopus to breed. They would open for just seven days for fishing.

However, the idea was met with resistance. And then there was a condition —  if the octopus catches were low, the plan would be abandoned. But the women were determined not to give up.

Hassan says: “When they opened the closures for the first time in April 2019 , they got 186 kilogrammes. It was not a good harvest. They immediately convened a meeting to discuss how they would improve. When they opened for the third time, they got 1, 500 kilogrammes.

This motivated them to keep going.”  Ijamba Idodi became Kenya’s then first and only sustainable octopus fishing project, established and run by women, who were defying the status quo.  Each octopus opening season kicks off with a competitive bidding process. The highest bidder gets to buy the entire catch throughout the opening period. The current market price per kilogramme is Sh150, but today, someone has put in a bid for Sh430 per kilogramme.

Octopuses, which like coral and clean water, are mainly fished during the spring tides when the low tide is at its lowest, exposing the reef flats. This makes fishing easier and safer for the women; especially those who cannot swim.

It’s 9am, and the women wade into the water. They look for tell-tale signs of tiny bubbles on the surface to indicate where a well-camouflaged octopus might be hiding between rocks and coral.

Amina suddenly announces that she has spotted a potential hiding place. She tries her luck. “It’s a struggle and not for the faint-hearted as it requires skills,” she explains. Eventually, she manages to get the octopus out of its hiding place. She notices it is missing some arms. “If I left it to die, it would be a loss to me,” she says.

We continue searching under the blazing sun, almost a kilometre away from the shore. Finally, we get one that is not hiding. With its quick and short movements, the octopus tries to get away, but Amina goes after it. It even squirts ink as a defence mechanism to distract her as it normally does to keep predators away. Finally, with a quick jab, Amina wins the chase.

Elated, she removes stones from the suckers on its arms and puts it in her container.

A few minutes later, we find another hiding place. But this one proves hard to get. “It has refused to come out and thus we will leave it here. That’s not my wish, but we can’t break the coral. Our duty is to conserve it,” says Amina.

The fishing expedition comes to an end at around noon and everyone heads back to the shore as the tide comes flowing in. The women meet at a point where the weighing of their harvest happens.

It has been a successful day.

Amina’s catch weighs 4. 27 kilogrammes.  From here, the octopuses are put in cooler boxes and transported to Mombasa for export.

Misbahu Awadh, a community fisheries expert, leads the fishermen and women in monitoring the catches. This is a key part of the project, providing important fisheries indicators that are useful for evaluating the closures.

“Initially, we didn’t know there were different species of octopuses. The experts from Madagascar also taught us how to identify the females and the males. Mostly, we catch the Sinea species as it stays in shallow waters.”

They also determine the octopus’ age by counting the suckers on its arms.

The short-term closures of the fishing grounds have proved to be a catalyst for conservation and the best practice in sustainable fishing of the octopus as it alleviates pressure on the ecosystem, allowing the area to regenerate and thrive.  The women save some money in a joint bank account. At the end of the year, the savings are split between Pate, Shanga Rubu and Shanga Ishakani Beach Management Units.

The women have used some of their earning from octopus sales to buy two boats.  The project has indeed transformed Shanga Ishakani. There are more buildings and electricity. And one building in particular, the pride and joy of the women, is set to change the lives of children The women started building a nursery school, which was completed by Lamu County government, which has also supported the octopus project by buying a boat, freezers, cooler boxes and other fishing accessories.

Octopuses are critical to marine ecosystems as they serve as food to other marine organisms and also feed on others, therefore bringing balance to the ocean. The octopus project in Nado Pate appears to be a working model —  it is improving livelihoods, enhancing women empowerment and also conserving marine ecosystems. News of its success is already spreading to communities as far as Kiunga, bordering Somalia, and there is hope of expanding the project along the Kenyan coast.

Crack down on terror recruiting agents,"These are terrible times, especially for youth, as devious groups exploit their desperation and vulnerability due to the rampant unemployment and helplessness. It is a serious national problem, but it is worse in the remote marginalised regions where international criminal syndicates have been recruiting and radicalising young people for terrorist groups. In some instances, traffickers promise jobs or safe passage to Europe and the Middle East but instead subject the recruits to exploitation and abuse. Somalia has over the years been a common destination for young people lured to join Al-Shabaab terrorists.

Recent reports indicate that shady recruitment agencies have been luring and ferrying Kenyan youth to as far as Libya. They actively operate in the northeastern and northwestern regions of Kenya. Recently, the people of Modogashe in Garissa County received a distress call about two young men, who had reportedly been kidnapped in Libya.

Video clips of the two allegedly being tortured sent shock waves through the region, forcing local leaders into action. There was a Sh5 million ransom demand and money was actually raised locally and sent to Libya. The two men are said to have been released but never returned home, which raises eyebrows.

Libya has in recent years been in the news over illegal immigrants being kidnapped and flogged as they sought to cross the sea and reach southern Europe. But for Kenyans who find themselves there, it is mostly about recruitment into terrorism.

Ironically, according to the International Organisation for Migration, Kenya is not listed among countries being monitored for the more than 700,000 immigrants in Libya. Niger, Egypt, Sudan, Chad and Nigeria feature prominently.

Security agencies should strictly monitor the clandestine recruitment agencies or agents behind this deadly racket tricking youth into believing they are being taken to Europe, only to be kidnapped in Libya. Garissa, Wajir and Mandera have reported cases of youth being held in Libya for ransom.

This transnational human trafficking violates the rights of the young people. There is a need for thorough investigations. The traffickers and their enablers must be stopped.

Seek alternative justice path,"While our court system is generally efficient, and one of the best in the region, it does not always deliver justice in each and every case. Sometimes, there are long delays that literally end up denying some litigants justice.

This is why it is not surprising to hear that Chief Justice Martha Koome is rooting for the development of alternative dispute resolution avenues. After all, she has first-hand experience as the top judicial officer, who has been involved in the justice delivery system long enough to know what works well and what does not.

Her most telling comment is that sometimes the formal justice system fails in some cases, and when this happens, it leaves the society divided and in deep acrimony. Indeed, this is why CJ Koome is encouraging fellow Kenyans and the justice sector to adopt reconciliation and mediation in resolving disputes. These are the key elements of the Alternative Justice System (AJS).

It is the inspiration behind the country’s first AJS centre that has been set up by religious leaders in collaboration with the Judiciary in Nakuru. However, this has been touted for years as a means to also help ease the endemic backlog of cases in the courts, complementing the formal justice system.

Indeed, it is simply a revival of the traditional dispute resolution methods that promoted unity and peaceful co-existence in Africa. Interestingly, the Nakuru centre is simply known as the House of Reconciliation, emphasising the need to be fair to the parties in a dispute.

The AJS is a simple and affordable means to quickly resolve disputes ranging from common crimes to family and property disputes to the satisfaction of all parties. More such centres should be established throughout the country.

Perfect Part causes shock 125-1 wicket in Hilary Needler Trophy,"Debutante, Perfect Part, (Cam Hardie 25-1), provided local owner, Keith Brown, a delightful gift, as he had been trying to win the 1,000 Hilary Needler Trophy, for 50 years. Perfect Part, who only cost $12,000, set aside seven seasoned youngsters, as a proponent for Royal Ascot.

Maw Lamb (Paddy Mathers 7-2), was the victim by half-a-length, because, he had endured a nightmare run after missing the break and getting stuck behind. Conditioned by Brian Ellison, Perfect Part's biggest attribute, apart from speed, is her willingness to shoot from the stalls like a rocket.

Shareholder (James Doyle 6-4), who cost €460,000, by comparison, is 4-1 for the Norfolk Stakes, after making a winning debut for Karl Burke - he has leading contenders for virtually all sophomore races at Royal Ascot.

Heading off Moving Force, in the Bet365 Trophy at Beverley, Shareholder is definitely one for the notebooks.

It was 2,060m, instead of 2,400m.

Lovely seeing ten loading - all smoothly and professionally. Dornoch, Seize the Grey, Mind Frame, and, Resilience, began proceedings up front. Sierra Leone (Flavien Prat 9-5), got bounced around after the gate but ran a blinding finish. Dornoch (Luis Saez 17-1), trained by Danny Gargan, managed to hold on from a cannon-shooting Mind Frame (Irad Ortiz Junior 4-1), Sierra Leone, and, Honor Marie.

Why healthcare players must evolve to meet modern consumer demands,"The healthcare industry is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by technological advancements, evolving patient expectations, and systemic shifts.

These changes are enhancing the quality of care and redefining how individuals access healthcare services.

Traditionally, people heavily relied on in-person visits to healthcare facilities, with little or no emphasis on preventative care. This limited access was particularly pronounced in rural and underserved communities where medical facilities and specialised care were often scarce.

In the past, the focus was predominantly on reactive care — treating illnesses and injuries as they occurred, rather than preventing them. This model of care often resulted in late diagnoses, more complex health issues, and higher costs for both patients and the healthcare system.

Preventative care, which emphasises early detection and proactive health management, was not a primary focus. Patients typically consulted healthcare providers only when symptoms became severe, missing out on the benefits of early intervention and regular health monitoring.

However, over the years, this scenario has rapidly evolved. Today, consumers are increasingly discerning about where and how they receive healthcare. The advent of digital health technologies, the internet, and increased access to information has empowered patients to take a more active role in their health management. People now seek more convenience, personalised care, and transparency in their healthcare experiences.

Adoption of telemedicine

One of the most significant advancements in healthcare access is the widespread adoption of telemedicine and telehealth services. Telemedicine allows patients to consult with healthcare providers remotely via video calls, phone calls, or online chat.

This is particularly beneficial for those living in remote areas, individuals with mobility issues, or those with demanding schedules that make it difficult to attend in-person appointments. Telehealth has expanded beyond simple consultations to include remote monitoring, virtual therapy sessions, and even some diagnostic services.

Another crucial advancement is the digitization of health records. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) allow for the seamless sharing of patient information across different healthcare providers and institutions.

This not only improves the coordination of care but also ensures that patients receive timely and accurate diagnoses and treatments. EHRs also facilitate better patient engagement, as individuals can access their health records, track their medical history, and be more involved in their own care.

Mobile health apps

Additionally, the proliferation of mobile health apps and wearable technology has empowered individuals to take charge of their health and wellness. Mobile apps can track a variety of health metrics such as diet, exercise, sleep patterns, and medication adherence.

Wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, provide real-time data on physical activity, heart rate, and other vital signs. These technologies not only encourage healthier lifestyles but also provide valuable data that can be shared with healthcare providers for more personalised care.

Access to medications has also been transformed through online pharmacies and home delivery services. Patients can now order prescriptions online and have them delivered to their homes, ensuring timely access to necessary medications. This is especially beneficial for those with chronic conditions requiring regular medication or those living in areas with limited pharmacy access.

Policy changes and innovations in health insurance have also contributed to improved access to healthcare. Governments and private insurers are increasingly recognising the importance of preventative care and are offering coverage for telehealth services, digital health tools, and wellness programmes. These policy shifts are making healthcare more affordable and accessible to a wider range of people.

Finally, the increasing demand from healthcare consumers for convenience and personalised care is driving the transformation of healthcare access. Patients today expect the same level of convenience and customisation in healthcare that they experience in other aspects of their lives. This demand is pushing healthcare providers to adopt more patient-centric approaches, offering services that are flexible, accessible, and tailored to individual needs.

At Jubilee Health, we are at the forefront of this transformation, innovating and deploying more patient-centric approaches.

Ruto walks back on plans for highrise buildings in Eastleigh,"President William Ruto has walked back on his plans to lift height restrictions for buildings surrounding the Moi Air Force Base in Eastleigh Nairobi and insisted that the national government is keen on safeguarding the airbase against security threats.

Dr Ruto who graced the 60th Kenya Air Force anniversary celebrations on Saturday, June 8, said that both the national and Nairobi county governments will work with the military command in the country to establish a framework for building restrictions surrounding the airbase.

“Let me also commit that in discussions with the county government of Nairobi, we will make sure that this facility does not lose its premium position. All the buildings that have been built beyond the height restrictions provided in law, we will work with the county to make sure that all developers keep to the standards we have agreed with the Kenya Air Force and the Kenya Defence Forces,” Dr Ruto said.

30 floors

His utterances are a big shift from his pronouncements in May where he gave the developers the green light to construct buildings of up to 30 floors.

“I am the commander-in-chief. In Eastleigh previously, you could not build more than a 12-storey building, but I have now declared that you can build up to 25- or 30-storey buildings so that citizens can get accommodation and live in a harmonious neighbourhood,” Dr Ruto told residents during a visit to Kiamaiko in Mathare.

During the recent Kenya Air Force celebrations, the Head of State also announced that the government will allocate resources to ensure the facility trains at least 200 pilots each year.

Thousands of guests at the event were treated to jaw-dropping aerial performances, aerobatic displays, and ground exhibitions by renowned aviation teams and cutting-edge aircraft from the military.

The Chief of the Defence Forces Charles Kahariri hailed the growth of the KAF and its role in securing the airspace in the country against security threats.

Formidable force

“The Kenya Air Force has grown into a formidable force not only in Kenya but also in East Africa over the past 60 years. It has demonstrated excellence in working in supporting the Kenyan Army, the Kenya Navy and other uniformed forces in securing our country. It has also participated in disaster response and emergency response in Kenya and beyond,” General Kahariri said.

The Commander of the Kenya Air Force Major General Fatuma Ahmed hailed the role of the KAF in several peacekeeping missions including the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) and Operation Linda Nchi.

“For the past 60 years, KAF has maintained its focus on the spirit and mission of securing the sovereign airspace of this country and improved its capability and capacity to respond to the emerging needs and threats. We have continuously provided air support, humanitarian support and logistical support,” General Fatuma said.

Kenya Air Force is one of the army forces that transitioned from the British Royal Air Force on June 1st 1964. The force is headquartered in Eastleigh Nairobi and has two other main airbases in Laikipia and Nanyuki.

The service has regained its status in the ranks of the Kenya Defence Forces following the events of August 21, 1982, where its personnel were involved in a coup to overthrow the government.

The coup was a plot by servicemen identifying themselves as The People's Redemption Council comprising Hezekiah Ochuka, as Chairman, Corporal Fenwicks Chesoli, Senior Sergeant Pancras Okumu Oteyo, Sergeant Joseph Ogidi Obuon, Sergeant Samuel Opiyo, Sergeant Richard Obuon, Corporal Fenwicks Chesoli, Corporal Ombok and Captain Agola.

Following the coup attempt, the government disbanded the Kenya Air Force and replaced it with the 82 Air Force. Its name later reverted to the Kenya Air Force following a High Court decision in 1993.

Suspected al-Shabaab militants kill 4 construction workers in Garissa,"At least four construction workers were killed on Friday, June 7 night by suspected al-Shabaab militants in the Bogyar area in Dadaab, Garissa County.

Dadaab Deputy County Commissioner Kipkirui Siele, while confirming the 10 pm incident, said four other people escaped unhurt.

All eight were non-locals engaged to renovate Bogyar dispensary by a local contractor.

“We had an incident where militants ambushed construction workers who were renovating a health facility in Bagyar area. We lost four people while four others escaped,” Mr Siele said.

According to Mr Siele, the attack could be due to business rivalry by local contractors.

""We have been having a dispute over the works at this facility and even clan elders got involved and a certain group was paid Sh150,000 to the work,"" the DCC revealed.

After the first group, comprising women, youths from the area also blocked the work wanting to be paid but it seemed their push was ignored.

""We are holding a suspect linked to the incident. He will help understand what exactly happened,"" Mr Siele said.

Dadaab Sub County Security Committee Chairman said the area has been experiencing resistance from locals whenever a development project is being undertaken.

""Earlier, we had been forced to provide security to a grader working on a public road passing through the area. The locals tend to block and dispute projects in the area,"" he said.

The affected construction workers arrived in the area on Saturday when materials were delivered but spent Sunday negotiating with locals over the work.

""Locals have been demanding to be given the tender to renovate the facility yet they had not applied for the same when it was announced. They claimed outsiders were getting tenders to work locally and we suspect this is what led to the attack,"" he said.

The bodies have since been taken to Mwingi where the workers had been sourced from.

""Our investigations are at an advanced stage and we shall be effecting more arrests because we can’t allow some people to operate in a lawless environment,"" Mr Siele said by phone.

"JSS teachers call off strike, give TSC one month to sort out their demands","Thousands of Junior Secondary School teachers, who have been on strike since April 17, 2024, have suspended their industrial action until July 5, 2024.

The intern teachers resolved to suspend their strike to pave the way for the National Assembly to pass the budget.

The 46,000 teachers have further urged their employer, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to employ them on Permanent and Pensionable terms. The graduate teachers were hired as interns in 2019.

Through their national spokesman Mr Omari Omari, the intern JSS teachers further urged TSC to release the circular about their confirmation to Permanent and Pensionable terms immediately after the budget has been passed.

“After a meeting of JSS County leaders, we resolved to suspend our demonstrations to pave the way for Parliament to pass the 2024/2025 budget on Thursday. By that date, we should have gotten communication on the status of the confirmation of the 46,000 teachers,” said Mr Omari.

46,000 interns

In a statement, the JSS teachers urged their colleagues to return to class as of June 10, 2024.

“Please note that this means the strike that began on April 17th, 2024 has not been called off, but suspended until July 5, 2024. By that date, we should have gotten communication on the status of the confirmation of the 46,000 teachers,” said Mr Omari.

Read: JSS teachers call off strike after deal with TSC

He said they have had a series of meetings with the National Assembly select committee on labour and its Education counterpart where they presented their demands.

Top among those demands is the confirmation of all the 46,000 interns.

“They agreed to our demands fully and presented them to the budget committee and have tabled the same in parliament and now awaits its passing,” he said.

Mr Omari said the committees urged them to suspend their demonstrations as they pass the budget.

The committee further requested the striking intern teachers to give TSC time to receive the money and prepare for their immediate recruitment.

“In respect of the seriousness with which they have so far handled our issues, and for the great love and care we have for the children of the poor Kenyan parents, we have decided to take their word and suspend our demonstrations,” he added.

However, he reminded parliamentarians that the ruling made by the courts that internship is illegal still stands.

Volunteers

“After consulting our legal team, we therefore wish to inform them that we shall go to the classes to teach from Monday not as interns, but as volunteers. We are doing this volunteerism because we seem to be the only people in the education sector who care for the children of Mama Mboga,” said Mr Omari.

Read: TSC now threatens to sack JSS teachers

He said they shall volunteer for the next four weeks to teach. However, if by the 5th of July TSC would not have made a communication on their confirmation they shall return to the streets.

“Teaching is a noble profession and we make sacrifices for the sake of the future of our nation, but TSC and the government cannot take advantage of our caring nature to enslave or exploit us,” said Mr Omari.

He said qualified and registered teachers should not be enslaved in the name of internship.

“We are still in pain and shocked that the government would actually use qualified teachers for years as slaves in this nation. But a strike is frustrating to our dear poor students. A strike is damaging and frustrating to us teachers. A strike is not something to be cherished,” said Mr Omari.

Last month, the National Assembly Committee on Education urged TSC to convert 26,000 interns to permanent employment beginning July 2024.

Nine die in Naivasha road accident,"At least nine people have died after a trailer rammed into the matatu they were travelling in at the VIP area, Maai mahiu, in Naivasha sub-county on Saturday evening.

According to Naivasha sub-county police Commander, Stephen Kirui, the lorry which was coming from Nairobi heading towards Narok direction lost control hitting the matatu which was also heading in the same direction.

He said that the matatu was ferrying passengers from Nairobi when it was hit from behind and rolled, hitting another vehicle.

According to Mr Kirui, out of the fatalities, those who died included five female adults, three male adults and a juvenile.

“We have had a terrible accident, which has claimed nine lives, those who were in one of the vehicles involved in the accident sustained slight injuries,"" said the police boss.

The eight people who sustained injuries were rushed to Oakland Hospital while the bodies were moved to Ume private mortuary.

Police arrest quack lawyer in Kisii,"A man has been remanded in police custody in Kisii after being arrested for allegedly impersonating a lawyer.

According to the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) - South Nyanza West Branch and police, the suspect, Benard Cheki Matware, was illegally practising under the name of Omariba and Company Advocates.

Mr Cheki had gone to the office of the Kisii County Lands Registrar, Mr Charles Ayienda, who eventually reported him to the police.

""The Lands Registrar, Mr Charles Ayienda, reported that a person claiming to be an advocate went to his office saying he was acting on behalf of his client, Venny Bosibori Ezekiel,"" Kisii County Police Commander Charles Kases said on Saturday.

The suspect had gone to the office to assist the unsuspecting client in obtaining land sale documents and, according to police, had obtained Sh40,000 from her.

When Mr Ayienda asked the suspect when he started practising, he was unable to explain, let alone produce a practising certificate.

Mr Kases said the suspect was arrested at the Lands Office and taken to the police cells.

""Forms duly signed by the suspect were recovered from him,"" Mr Kases said.

LSK South Nyanza West branch chairperson Benard Gichana, secretary general Justus Maeche and lawyer George Morara led members in warning individuals masquerading as lawyers in the region that their days were numbered.

""When we got wind of the incident, we went to the Lands Office where the suspect changed his story and claimed to be an employee of a law firm. He had documents including land sale agreements and transfer forms,"" said Mr Gichana.

Mr Maeche said such an incident was likely to undermine the confidence that members of the public had in the legal profession in their quest for justice.

""The client had paid the stamp duty in March but her transaction was still pending,"" Mr Maeche said, adding that they would not allow an unqualified and unregistered person to practise as an advocate in the region.

Mr Kases said the suspect would be taken to court to face charges including impersonating a lawyer and obtaining money by false pretence.

Exposed: How an intern hired staff for a government agency,"The National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) used an intern to recruit county coordinators for deployment across the country, an audit has revealed, exposing human resource management lapses at the agency set up to help Kenya reduce poverty and inequality.

The intern was part of an interview and selection committee that met with 235 candidates and hired 45 of them as county coordinators, though the process was marred by irregularities that saw undeserving people hired at the expense of qualified professionals, an audit has revealed.

""A review of the interview scorecards revealed that the interview panel included a human resources trainee. The intern was not appointed as a member of the interview and selection committee but participated in the interview process as a panellist, awarded marks and signed the interview score sheets,"" Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu reveals in a report on NGAAF for the year ending June 2023.

Ms Gathungu notes that NGAAF could not explain why the intern was involved in interviewing candidates for senior positions, nor could it prove that members of the shortlisting and selection committees had declared that they had no conflict of interest in the recruitment process.

""In the absence of the declaration, the integrity of the process may have been compromised,"" she says.

Established in 2015 as one of the government's Vision 2030 initiatives, NGAAF is mandated to address the plight of vulnerable groups by reducing poverty and inequality through improved access to financial facilities for the socio-economic empowerment of women, youth, persons with disabilities, vulnerable children and the elderly in the country.

However, the Auditor-General notes that the Fund continues to operate without a human resources plan or a Human Resources Management Advisory Committee, which is supposed to manage its recruitment processes, constitute interview panels and appoint its representatives to the interview panel.

""As a result, the recruitment process was in breach of NGAAF policy,"" it says, referring to the hiring of 45 district coordinators.

The report also faulted the process for failing to recruit people with disabilities, even though some of the 27 people who applied for the positions were qualified.

In Tana River County, the audit notes that the person hired as county coordinator came second in the recruitment process, but in an anomaly, his score was somehow raised from 47.8 to 60.3. A similar case was observed in Homa Bay County.

""Had the anomaly not occurred, the second ranked candidate who scored 56.6 (in Tana River) would have been the highest ranked candidate and therefore appointed instead of the person selected by the selection committee,"" it says.

""Records show that the successful candidate for Makueni County was rejected in writing by the County Patron and indicated her preferred candidate who was ranked second and subsequently appointed as County Coordinator.

""This was contrary to the provisions of the Human Resources Policy and Procedures Manual, which states that staff are recruited on the basis of merit after a recruitment exercise and not on the basis of personal preference,"" the audit added.

Walking the red carpet of my students’ competence,"One of the most satisfying parts of my ongoing celebration of my longevity is the joy I derive from following the spectacular successes and performances of my former students.

It would be invidious to mention names, as “success” seems to be the defining star on the breast of squads of my former charges.

Within the past few years, for example, I have marvelled at the reality of my having “taught” two Vice-Chancellors, Prof Aaron Mushengyezi of the Uganda Christian University, and the Reverend Canon Prof Jane Wangari Mwai of the Presbyterian University of East Africa.

Last Saturday, June 1st 2024, I literally walked the red carpet as a film star. This was at the launch of a film, a 13-part docuseries titled “Tuko Pamoja” (we are one/together), in which I feature as one of the performers.

The film is, largely, an oral history of present-day Uganda, and its main theme is that, despite the large variety of the communities that make up the national entity today, we are basically one people. We lived close to one another and interacted intimately in many ways, many centuries before colonialism “forced” us together.

The film was conceived and directed by Dr Cindy Evelyn Magara, a cineaste with the Nyati Motion Pictures and a lecturer in film and literature at Makerere University.

Dr Magara was one of my early students on my return to Makerere, but I only taught her Literature and Orature, and nothing about films. But she always had a keen interest in the area, and after her Master’s degree at Makerere, she proceeded to Australia, where she specialised in film, honing her skills for her now evidently promising career.

The venue of the red-carpet film premiere was the Ndere Centre in the Ntinda suburbs of Kampala.

It is a top-notch performance and entertainment facility founded and managed by Dr Stephen Rwangyezi, regarded by many as a legendary hero of Uganda’s and indeed East Africa’s indigenous performance. Rwangyezi, too, was a student of mine at the then-Music Dance and Drama Department at Makerere. Since I cannot sing or dance, I think I taught him acting and scripting.

Soon after graduation from Makerere, Rwangyezi started his Ndere (flute) Troupe, which has performed and continues to perform around the world. I do not remember teaching Rwangyezi anything about being an impresario or a showbiz entrepreneur, about which I do not know anything anyway.

Educate the young

Still, my heart warms up (and maybe my head swells a little) whenever I step into the Ndere Centre and the great man welcomes me and introduces me to all and sundry as his Mwalimu.

How do you teach and prepare a young person to be a future Vice-Chancellor, film director or international theatre director?

I heard recently that my former star performer at Kenyatta University’s Creative and Performing Arts Centre, Dr Hamisi Babusa, has launched his own TV channel, Babusa TV.

He and his amazingly vigorous team of “Babusa Kids” are entertaining and educating us with their series of songs and dances. Their “Song of Kenyan Communities” is, think, a classic of creativity.

You probably know that “competency” and competence” have been, and still are, keenly on my mind, as indeed on the mind of many parents and educationists, ever since we adopted the “CBC”, competency-based curriculum.

Those of us who have been long enough on the educational and pedagogic scene are aware of the many experiments that have been carried out, since ancient times, in the best ways to teach and educate the young.

The purpose in all the experiments is to produce individuals best suited to life and service in their societies.

You have in recent times, for example, heard of “learner-centred” education, STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) approaches and our now highly touted “CBC”.

The mechanisms behind the approaches are the latest social and technological developments and the educators’ perceptions of the opportunities and challenges that these offer and pose for the rising generation.

Educational philosophers and planners observe these and then formulate and propose the pedagogical paths we should take.

The proposals are often in the form of reports and, at government level, “white papers”, which are then passed on to educational administrators and us teachers for implementation.

Eminent educationist

In East Africa we may remember the Ominde Report of 1965, which laid the foundation for post-independence education in Kenya. Later, the Mackay Report of 1981 ushered in the now-fading 8-4-4 system.

In Uganda, the Kajubi Report of 1992 proposed, among other things, the teaching of Kiswahili in schools, a sound policy that is only being implemented today.

The late Kajubi, an eminent educationist, was twice Vice-Chancellor of Makerere and he later founded one of the country’s first private universities, the very respectable Nkumba University, near Entebbe.

I most vividly remember his addressing us at the University of Nairobi after the 1979 ouster of Idi Amin, begging us Ugandan academics who had flocked to Kenya to go home and participate in the reconstruction effort.

Back to competency, I suppose it is not an entirely new concept. The ability to cope and perform adequately in real life situations is a basic requirement of any functional formation.

Competency may not always be measurable in concrete, quantifiable terms, but perceptive and critical engagement with reality is probably the most useful competency that liberal arts teachers like me may contribute to the life skills of our students.

To end with a joke, John McClough, my friend and Head of Department at the Machakos Girls School, back in the late 1970s, once told me of a British military officer who left him thoroughly confused with talk of combatant and non-combatant units in the British army.

John was a typical Irish country lad and to his rustic ears, “combatant” and “non-combatant” in the British officer’s clipped accents sounded like “competent” and “non-competent”.

John kept wondering if there were competent and non-competent units within the British army. In my orature theory, I call such mishaps cases of “hearing and mishearing”, comparable to reading and misreading.

MPs fault move to cross-subsidise fuel,"Parliament has faulted the move to cross-subsidise fuel on grounds that it is illegal amid concerns of court cases by disgruntled consumers.

Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) has in the current prices used diesel consumers to cross-subsidise super petrol and kerosene users, helping lower the prices of the two by Sh1.20 and Sh1.30 respectively.

The energy regulator and ministry of Energy have in the past been sued over the cross-subsidisation of fuel, on grounds that the move is unfair and denies consumers higher price cuts.

Cross-subsidy denies users of one grade of fuel higher price cuts whenever global prices fall while cushioning others whenever the prices of their grade of fuel go up internationally. It however helps the Exchequer to avoid spending more money to keep pump prices low.

“The committee noted that the cross-subsidisation policy currently in place which entails charging higher prices to a group of consumers to subsidise lower prices for another group is not clearly anchored in the Energy Act, 2019 and relevant regulations,” the Budget committee says.

The courts have in past dismissed similar concerns from consumers that cross-subsidisation of fuel is not anchored in law.

A litre of super petrol is currently retailing at Sh192.84 and Sh168.76 for kerosene in Nairobi, down from Sh193.84 and Sh170.06 respectively while that of diesel dropped to Sh179.18 from Sh180.38.

But the move denied diesel consumers a higher drop given that its prices in the global markets dropped in April, unlike those for super petrol and kerosene.

Last year, a case challenging Epra’s move to apply cross-subsidy was filed at the High Court in Mombasa with the petitioner arguing that Epra abused pricing regulations by overcharging super petrol consumers to cushion users of diesel.

But the court dismissed the petition saying that it was not convinced by the petitioner’s argument that the cross-subsidy was not anchored in law.

The law allows the ministry of Energy to draw funds raised through the PDL to stabilise pump prices whenever global costs of refined fuel soar.

This is through the Petroleum Development Fund Act and relevant regulations that were gazetted in 2021 that anchor collection of the levy at a rate of Sh5.40 per litre of super petrol and diesel and Sh0.40 for every litre of kerosene.

But the law and relevant regulations are quiet on cross-subsidy, a legal loophole that has in the past led to legal suits over the cross-subsidisation.

The State initially used petrol consumers to cross-subsidise diesel given that it is the fuel which is most used across the economy.

The economy uses diesel for transportation, power generation and running of agricultural machinery, underlining its significance to the economy.

But the move to use diesel consumers to cross users of super petrol and kerosene denied a vast chunk of the economy from enjoying the benefits of the global drop in costs of the fuel.

Cross-subsidisation of fuel allows the Exchequer to share the burden with consumers of at least one of the three grades of fuel.

But the cross-subsidy also raises questions on how the billions of shillings collected through the PDL are used.

The Ministry of Energy has in the past been on the spot for diverting the money to sectors that are not linked to the petroleum sector, leading to depletion of the kitty.

Price stabilisation and now cross-subsidisation have been key in helping the government to avoid public outrage over escalating costs of fuel.

All eyes are on the energy regulator and ministry to see if they will keep the cross-subsidy or turn to stabilisation in the coming months given that global prices of fuel are anticipated to remain stable.

A sustained drop in global prices of fuel last year coupled with strengthening of th shilling from early this year, allowed the government to steer away from the PDL kitty.

The energy regulator, ministry of Energy and the National Treasury turned to cross-subsidy amid struggles by the Exchequer to pay oil marketers billions of shillings for the stabilised prices and also pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The IMF— one of Kenya’s biggest financiers and one with a big say in influencing economic policies of the country— had given Kenya a deadline to fully scrap the price stabilisation.

For example, the Treasury opted to convert a Sh45 billion debt owed to oil marketers to a bond last year, amid struggles to pay the money.

The government has been collecting billions of shillings through the Petroleum Development Levy, raising questions on whether the money collected is not enough to stabilise prices.

Consumers of super petrol and diesel pay Sh5.40 for every litre of the two fuels and a further Sh0.40 per litre of kerosene. The money is meant to help keep pump prices lower whenever there is a hike in the global market.

Kenya ended the stabilisation scheme last year but made a U-turn and a cross-subsidisation before the end of the year as prices of fuel soared in the global markets.

Bio-digesters and managing animal waste,"If not properly managed, human and animal waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.

Additionally, poor waste management is the leading cause of hygiene-related deadly illnesses like cholera and typhoid.

The situation worsens when the waste is discharged in rivers, lakes and other water bodies through sewer lines.

Approximately 4.5 billion people have no access to proper and adequate sanitation worldwide, often relying on pit latrines.

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas emitted from human and animal waste, accounts for more than 20 per cent of global warming.

Agriculture has been hit hard by climate change. Mitigating climate change effects requires a collective approach, including adopting green energy and green waste management solutions.

Green energy is derived from renewable sources like solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydroelectric power. These are environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels and are often readily available.

Waste disposal methods

A practical method for managing human and animal waste is using bio-digesters.

These kits offer a hygienic and cost-effective alternative to traditional waste disposal methods like exhausters.

“Using exhausters to dispose of waste is costly and unhygienic,” says Katra Abdinasir, a resident of Njiru in Nairobi County who installed a bio-digester at her residence in 2021.

She now saves up to 90 per cent waste management costs. Unlike septic tanks, bio-digesters emit no odour.

“The installation is once and the kit requires small space,” says Japhet Mwangi Kariuki of Bio Digesters Kenya.

The system comprises pipes connected from the waste source to chambers and a soak pit, which releases liquid into the soil.

It operates efficiently and does not require emptying since the water input is balanced by the discharge.

Bio-digesters use anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to digest waste (enzymes), producing gases such as methane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The enzyme helps break down solid waste into liquid.

The amount of water flushed into the bio-digester from the house is displaced through the outlet baffle into the soaking area, making it impossible for the system to fill up. That is why emptying is not necessary.

The system is installed underground, with the depth depending on size.

There are several types of bio-digesters. Apart from human stool, animal waste can also be used to generate biogas, which serves as a source of fuel for cooking and lighting.

Jane Wanjiku, a farmer in Ikinu, Kiambu County, has installed a bio-digester at her residence.

The cowdung processed in the bio-digester is also used as farmyard manure.

“The manure extracted after producing biogas is full of nutrients for the vegetables, fruits, maize, beans and other plants,” Wanjiku’s farmhand, Peter Kamau, tells the Seeds of Gold.

Oxygen-free environment

A bio-digester is sealed. Micro-organisms in the bio-digester break down organic material to produce biogas and fertiliser.

The anaerobic digestion creates an oxygen-free environment conducive for bacteria to consume the waste and thrive.

According to a paper published by Nature Climate Change in 2020, composting human waste produces good fertiliser for agriculture, enhancing safety, sustainability, job creation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste-borne illnesses.

Established in 2011 as the continuation of Nature Reports Climate Change, Nature Climate Change is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Nature Portfolio.

It covers all aspects of research on global warming and its effects.

Sanitation contributes two to six per cent of the Earth’s methane emissions and one to three per cent of nitrous oxide emissions.

Effective green waste management solutions are important in combating climate change and improving public health.

By adopting technology like bio-digestion, communities can reduce their environmental footprint and enhance the quality of life.

Close call in Mogadishu: A journalist’s timely memoir,"Book: Close Call in Mogadishu: A Journalist’s MemoirAuthor: Mark AgutuPages: 100

Somalia is rising from the debris of decades of civil war and political turmoil and asserting itself again on the world stage.

A few days ago, a newly confident Somalia - in a diplomatic dispute related to a port deal between Ethiopia and the breakaway region of Somaliland - threatened to expel Ethiopian troops if that agreement was not scrapped.

About 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers are stationed in various regions of Somalia, some 3,000 of them as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission called ATMIS that is fighting the terrorist group Al-Shabaab, which still controls large parts of Somalia.

In the same week, Somalia, which has not seen peace since President Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled in 1991, won a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the first time it will hold the position since the 1970s.

The UNSC decides how the world body responds to conflicts, and Somalia’s experience will influence those decisions.

That is a far cry from the situation 20 years ago. Things were much more fluid then, and nothing was guaranteed.

In 2007, the Somalia Transitional Federal Government – based in Nairobi, elected months earlier following a peace conference and led by a man named Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed - moved to Mogadishu.

But clashes between warring factions had almost scuttled that relocation months earlier. President Ahmed had sent a fact-finding mission to Mogadishu, led by Prime Minister Ali Gedi.

Read: My Madaraka Day thoughts and a belated welcome to Somalia

Their assignment was to assess conditions in the capital and see whether the newly elected government could operate from there.

On May 4, 2005, Gedi was addressing thousands of Somalis in the Mogadishu National Stadium on the new government’s planned agenda when … boom! An explosion rattled the stadium, killing 15 people and injuring dozens.

Gedi was spared, though it could not be determined whether the terrorists who had planted the bomb were targeting him.

But that was Mogadishu being Mogadishu – dangerous, lawless, chaotic, fluid, uncertain.

This unnerving event, the history that preceded it, the aftermath and snippets of life in the Somali capital are the subjects of Mark Agutu’s new book, Close Call in Mogadishu: A Journalist’s Memoir.

Agutu was a court reporter for the Daily Nation but had been asked by his news editor to be part of a group of journalists to accompany leaders of Somalia’s new government on their first trip to Mogadishu.

As someone conversant with Somalia’s recent history, Agutu was acutely aware of what he was in for, as this would be his first trip to that war-scarred country.

He describes his fears about his safety, some triggered by his consumption of popular culture, but also cites his excitement.

In a brisk, readable narrative style, Agutu outlines historical events that led up to the transitional government’s homecoming.

Read: Kenya offers deal to ease Ethiopia-Somalia spat

The negotiations in Nairobi and elsewhere between warring parties were complicated and hadn’t been easy, and were frequently interrupted by clashes back in Somalia.

It wasn’t easy either for some of the countries that worked to help Somalia regain stability. The most notable episode came in October 1993 and involved American special forces, who had come to Mogadishu to arrest warlord Mohamed Aidid and his lieutenants.

In the shootout that ensued, a US chopper was shot down and dozens of American soldiers and hundreds of Somalis were killed, becoming the inspiration for the non-fiction book Black Hawk Down and the 2001 war film of the same name.

Kenya was hit too, though not on the same scale. Months earlier, in July, the Americans had bombed Aidid’s headquarters with helicopters. Outraged mobs confronted international journalists who had gone to the scene of the attack and killed four, including two Kenyans.

The devastating events of 1993 were a major setback for Somalia and the countries working to help it, and the author outlines the peace efforts the international community made in the years that followed. Kenya was among the countries deeply involved in these efforts.

Agutu also provides glimpses of one iconic building in Mogadishu that still stood as a symbol of not just power but the resilience of the Somali people.

It is Villa Somalia, the complex overlooking the Indian Ocean that started life in 1936 as the residence of governors in Italian Somaliland.

For the warlords, it was a status symbol, and many battles were fought among various factions for control of it in the years that followed the overthrow of Siad Barre.

Read: Somalia to defend itself if Ethiopia seals 'illegal' port deal

Though carrying bullet and mortar marks and is no longer glitzy, Agutu writes, it carries its frame and features “stoically like a proud soldier bearing the scars of war”.

There was another curious symbol of Somali resilience that Agutu writes about. In tight security, journalists accompany PM Gedi to a Catholic mission on the outskirts of Mogadishu led by an elderly nun that serves deprived Somalis.

There is a church, a school, a health centre and residences - an island of Christian endeavour in a sea of Islam.

The nuns, Agutu writes, “doubled up as teachers, farmers, medical workers and social workers, spearheading mercy missions for the benefit of the local population”.

The dedication. The sacrifice. The patience. The audacity.

Writing about the resilience of the Somali people, Agutu says that the dynamics that attended the negotiations that led to the creation of the transitional government “might have served to portray Somalis as intolerant people, blinded by unfettered loyalty to clan interests at the expense of other considerations for nation building”.

But in the short time he spent in Mogadishu, he found ordinary Somalis “a friendly, welcoming lot and even their language is interesting to learn.”

This timely book is not just about a week in the working life of a journalist and the sacrifices they often make at great risk to their own lives to bring us important stories about our world.

It is also about interesting and consequential episodes from the recent history of Somalia, a country scarred by war and struggling to get back on its feet.

"Cry, the beloved country: Of elections and South Africa","“There is a lovely road that runs from Ixopo into the hills. These hills are grass-covered and rolling, and they are lovely beyond any singing of it. The road climbs seven miles into them, to Carisbrooke; and from there, if there is no mist, you look down on one of the fairest valleys of Africa.

""About you there is grass and bracken and you may hear the forlorn crying of the titihoya, one of the birds of the veld. Below you is the valley of the Umzimkulu, on its journey from the Drakensberg to the sea; and beyond and behind the river, great hill after great hill... The grass is rich and matted, you cannot see the soil… It is well-tended, and not too many cattle feed upon it; not too many fires burn it, laying bare the soil.

""Stand unshod upon it, for the ground is holy, being even as it came from the Creator… But the rich green hills break down. They fall to the valley below, and falling, change their nature. For they grow red and bare; they cannot hold the rain and mist, and the streams are dry…. Too many cattle feed upon the grass, and too many fires have burned it… The titihoya does not cry here any more… The men are away, the young men and the girls are away. The soil cannot keep them anymore”.

These words are from Alan Paton’s novel entitled Cry, the Beloved Country. It’s a cry for South Africa, the beautiful rainbow nation — a yearning for the not-yet and what could have been.

South Africa is a magical, promising place. One that could possibly gallop, not trot in development. And yet…

Read: ANC, Africa's oldest liberation movement, is 'broke'

There is probably as much beauty as pain. Paton’s prose is beautifully measured, subtle and sober, full of emotional appeal and reverberation — taking readers into the caverns of a country’s griefs remembered.

South Africa has been in the news recently because Wednesday, May 29, 2024, was the day it held its general elections.

And it’s now a far cry from the land Paton described with “a lovely road that runs from Ixopo into the hills”.

Politicians have ruined and laid it to waste in their effort to claim it for themselves. It’s now a land on fire, in a fountain of sparks and embers.

The country has been engulfed by the rippling flames that have bedevilled other African countries (Kenya included) like high unemployment (especially among the youth), poor quality public education, inadequate infrastructure, corruption and lack of government accountability and wanton lawlessness prevailing in the streets especially in some cities.

Read: How South Africa’s ANC became just a regular political party

The May 2024 South African elections were a time for hope like many other elections in Africa — an opportunity for reset and rejuvenation.

However, elections can also bring despair. As the South African Adrian Gore, Group Chief Executive, Discovery, writes, “The optimism paradox — the gap between private hope and public despair — is an intriguing idiosyncrasy explained by behavioural economics … On the one hand is our belief, that in our personal lives, our future will be better than our past, known as the optimism bias… Counter-intuitively, however, this private optimism is contrasted with a persistent and pervasive public pessimism, known as declinism — the belief that our world (or country) is on an irreversible downhill trajectory”.

When Paton describes the land as having “Too many cattle feeding upon the grass, and too many fires … The titihoya does not cry here anymore,” that’s his version of declinism, what Adrian Gore calls “a seemingly irreversible downward trajectory”.

And South Africa, according to media reports, has been on a downward trajectory so much that power outages have been almost routine.

Voters seem to have seen the country on a downward trajectory because they delivered a stunning rebuke to the incumbent President Cyril Ramaphosa and his ruling African National Congress (ANC) party where only slightly over 40 per cent of voters voted for the ANC.

Besides, the ANC seems to have other challenges because it now seems split after former President Jacob Zuma started his own political party — umKhonto weSizwe, or MK — that got more than 10 per cent of votes in the recent elections; a percentage that was big enough to deny ANC an outright win.

Read: The slow death of Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress

Reports indicate that the ANC has begun closed-door negotiations with other parties with the aim of forming a coalition government.

Hopefully, the new coalition will be able to arrest the downward trajectory to set the rainbow nation on a path of growth, tackling the myriads of challenges facing it.

May South Africa again become that beautiful land that Paton describes in Cry, the Beloved Country, with “hills… grass-covered and rolling, and… lovely beyond any singing of it”.

A land in which, “you may hear the forlorn crying of the titihoya”. For this is the land of milk and honey that could have been had South Africa taken a different path.

The reality is more rugged and brutal but the new political formation can change the country’s course.

All the best, land of Mandela, where the moon glows behind speeding clouds and the distant hills — great hill after great hill — bristle green and orange and velvet in the evening sun.

'I traded a glorious career in aviation to make sanitary pads',"Lorna Joyce Wanjiku wears many hats. She is an agripreneur, a flight cabin crew leader with over 11 years of experience, and co-founder and CEO of Binti Marvel, a sanitary pads company.

“I founded Binti Marvel in May 2021, and we manufacture Binti Pads and panty liners. We started with four employees – a warehouse manager, three sales people, and myself. I used to be the driver, the accountant, social media manager, and the call centre for customer support,"" she says.

""That helped me understand the business from all aspects. We now have 25 employees working in various departments and we always include more women because this company is made by women for women.”

Born and brought up in Nairobi, Lorna’s dream was to become a flight attendant.

“This came after we went on a school trip to the airport. I saw the cabin crew looking beautiful, neat and organised as they pulled their suitcases, and I made up my mind to be like them when I grow up,” she remembers.

The firstborn in a home of two achieved her childhood dream, but she was not prepared for the journey.

“My dad was a police officer and my mother was a stay-at-home mum. I had one young brother. Life was great! We lived in a seven-room house provided by the government.

“When I joined Form One in 2006, my brother was admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). One day, as my dad was going to visit him and pay his hospital bill, he was attacked by thugs and killed. Two weeks later, my brother succumbed to the illness,” she says amid tears.

“We were kicked out of the government house. We did not have any possessions, and we soon found ourselves living with my mother’s sister in Mukuru kwa Reuben slums. Life there was difficult.

""All of a sudden I started lacking bus fare to go to school. My mother also struggled to pay my school fees. I resorted to doing my schoolmates’ hair and laundry to stay in school,” she says.

She loved being in school, as this gave her an escape from life in the slums. Lorna’s mother soon slipped into depression and turned to alcohol, and Lorna found herself taking care of her depressed mother as she juggled her studies.

“After completing high school, my dad’s pension was processed, and my mother told me to choose what I wanted to do with the money. I still dreamed of becoming a cabin crew, so I decided to enroll at Nairobi Aviation for the course.

“I commuted from Mukuru to the school, but my mother kept telling me that Mukuru was not the place for me. She urged me to work hard in school. Her condition was not getting any better, and I remember she called me in August 2010, right after I had joined the aviation school, and asked me what I would want her to do for me as she did not have much time left.

“I didn’t really understand what that meant, but I told her that because I had never celebrated a birthday since my dad’s demise, I wanted her to have a birthday party. She organised an extravagant 17th birthday celebration for me in October that year. Unfortunately, she died a few days later.

Left with no one to turn to, Lorna had to grow up fast. She moved from Mukuru to Umoja and rented a single room.

She would take up any available job to sustain herself, while updating her resume and taking it to Wilson Airport.

“One day I got a call from one of the airlines at Wilson and the person on the other end said they were tired of seeing my CV every other month. They called me for an interview, I got the job and that is how my aviation career began.

“But life with this airline wasn’t so glamorous. We weren’t flying to London or to the US like I had imagined, we were going to Somalia, Congo and other poor African countries where I met the harsh reality of the world.

""My first flights were to Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. Our job was to help refugees flee from war-torn areas. I learnt that life is very hard for many people out there. I enjoyed making a difference in people’s lives.”

With time Lorna grew in rank and became the head of in-flight.

“I had done so many courses and became a trainer. I was earning good money, but I wasn’t investing at all. One of my pilot friends, a farmer, told me to consider farming. Without much thought, I leased a huge piece of land in Nyeri. I suffered huge losses from that.”

As if that was not enough, in 2020, during Covid, she invested in planting cabbages. The prices dropped so sharply. She decided to donate the produce to slums instead of losing it all.

“This was a very fulfilling period. I would give people cabbage, and they would ask me, what more do you have to give us? This question always left me wanting to do more.

""A light-bulb moment happened in January 2021 when my friend and I watched a clip on social media of a woman from Machakos who was being molested by her father in exchange for sanitary pads.

“I partnered with my friend Beth Karagu who is in the USA, and together we developed the idea of making quality but affordable sanitary towels. We did our research and found out that most of the pads sold in Kenya were imported, so we are never sure of the quality.

“We also found out that the sanitary pad industry is male-dominated, which is ironic because men do not exactly know the discomfort that substandard pads can cause. Even at the research level, we faced challenges as people were not quite open to our local brand.”

Binti pads are available in Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Mombasa. Their regular pads cost Sh75 and extra-long ones go for Sh95. Panty liners cost Sh190. They also donate and offer menstrual hygiene education to young girls.

In October 2023, Lorna resigned from her aviation job where she was Head of In-Flight with Air Traffic Airlines.

“Initially, we made 100,000 packets in 10 months but currently we are producing 100,000 packets a month,” she says.

Safaricom wants eTIMS out of M-Pesa transaction fees,"Safaricom is seeking changes to the Income Tax Act to exempt M-Pesa transaction fees from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)’s electronic Invoice Management System(eTIMS), citing the strenuous task of generating paperwork for the millions of daily transactions.

The giant telco proposes that the M-Pesa transaction charges be deemed deductible expenses to spare users the agony of coming up copious volumes of electronically generated invoices on eTIMS.

A deductible for taxes is an expense that a taxpayer or business can subtract from adjusted gross income, which reduces their taxable income, thereby cutting the amount of taxes owed to the taxman.

“M-Pesa services such as withdrawing cash, sending e-money, buying pre-paid airtime et cetera attract transaction fees. The transaction volumes of this kind are in the tune of millions on any given day,"" Safaricom said in its submission before the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee regarding Finance Bill 2024.

M-Pesa platform transactions

""In a month, the M-Pesa platform completes approximately 200 million transactions. To generate electronic tax invoices for each of these kinds of transactions, a seamless integration of several systems from both Safaricom’s and the Kenya Revenue Authority’s end is required,” it added.

The Finance Act 2023 amended Section 16 of the Income Tax providing that effective January 1, 2024, only expenses backed by eTIMS invoiced will be deemed admissible for income deduction purposes.

Disclosures by the telecommunications firm indicated that in the 12 months ended March 2024 alone, the value of M-Pesa transactions stood at the previous year.

This means that on average, the M-Pesa platform transactions averaged Sh110.25 billion daily.

Mobile money transactions

Safaricom further says fees incurred in the undertaking of mobile money transactions should be handled the same way fees related to other financial services are treated and, therefore, be accorded exemption from the requirement of being backed by eTIMS invoices.

The telco said given that the M-Pesa platform is widely used for mobilisation of resources for charitable undertakings, failure to exempt the platform’s transaction from mandatory eTIMS invoices risks derailing crowdfunding by Kenyans pursuing social and non-profit seeking outcomes.

“The requirement to issue electronic tax invoices applies to persons carrying on business in Kenya. However, most of charitable organisations do not conduct income-generating activities and therefore are not required to issue electronic tax invoices. Potential donors will shun donating to such charitable organisations as they are not incentivised through income tax deductions,” Safaricom told the committee.

Finance Bill 2024 has proposed the tightening of eTIMS implementation through amendment of the Tax Procedures Act providing for a steep penalty of Sh2.0 million per month for failure to integrate one’s systems with eTIMS for the generation of electronic invoices.

"King Kaka: ‘I was a slave to money, now I’m living’","Perhaps Kennedy “King Kaka” Ombima’s journey to stardom is a metaphor for the road I am taking to meet him. I am on Mombasa Road, joining Outering Ring Road, making my way to Tassia, through a tarmac road or what used to be a tarmac road, several axle-breaking potholes, human traffic and parts of a road that don’t look like parts of a road at all.

If this sounds like the road to success, then you will be right on the money. He grew up here, in Eastlands, and the city kept its promise to him: a businessman, a musician, a poet, a scriptwriter; this is Kaka Empire.

Fame, however comes with its shadow twin, shame. And he almost lost it all when he tangled with death some time back and “my money couldn’t save me.” He lost his appetite. Lost weight. The king, was, well, naked. Now he leaves nothing to chance. “I laugh more. I watch more movies. I am doing what I want,” he says. “I am a genius.” Clearly, he is not struggling with self-esteem.

It is fitting then that we hold our interview in the backdrop of an open-air crusade, seeing that he was born again, a resurrection from the jaws of death—the Grim Reaper, after all, is not known for his affinity for cash, but souls.

What makes you, you?

I have a unique eye; I see things differently and always have. This ability has served me well in my career, allowing me to explore various opportunities.

What got you here?

Working with a goal and crafting with intention. It’s about transforming what's in your head into reality. That’s wise; right? [chuckles].

What did you know then that has helped you now?

That poverty is a big motivation. When you lack, you have all the time to think about the things you don’t have. That propelled me. I would credit my zeal and vision, but largely it is poverty. I lacked and so I wanted to conquer the world.

You are a businessman, an artist, a father, a husband, and now a film producer. Do you ever feel like a prisoner of selves?

This may be cliche, but Eliud Kipchoge's famous quote “No human is limited” resonates with me, it's become my life mantra. With vision, you find a purpose to face the future. It’s all about what you want for yourself.

For instance, yesterday I slept at 4 am, I was up by 7 am, and I was on set by 8.30 am. I have been shooting all day and now I am in the studio. I have two other meetings to attend, which means I will get home at around midnight. It’s all about what you want for yourself.

What are you chasing, or rather, what are you running away from?

Haha! I am running away from poverty, not just the lack of finances, but also of a state of mind. I believe in continuously evolving. I am almost 40 years old. I have lived through the VCR, cassette, CD, DVD, VCD, flash drives, and streaming platforms. I have experienced that kind of evolution. The question is what is your Lego block toward evolution—in any field that you pick?

What does money mean to you now?

Money is a tool to realise dreams. It helps execute ideas and prepares you better for opportunities. There were times I had crazy ideas, but I didn’t have the money, so it seemed impossible. Now that I have money, when I have a dream, I go to one of my accounts and execute it. I will put together the initial budget, and by the time I approach potential partners, I already have a base. My strategy is to always walk into the room more prepared than the previous guy or the next guy.

Can one have it all?

Yes, but balance is key. My health scare (over four months of hospitalisation) taught me to value life more, work less, and enjoy time with loved ones. I was a crazy workaholic—now, I don’t work on Mondays and Thursdays. I was a slave to money but I realised it is never enough. Now I hang out, go on road trips, and travel. This year, I am taking two vacations; one in Rwanda and the other in the US. When I was hospitalised, I realised that no matter how much money you have, it is nothing. I could not walk, nor eat, but I had money. And it could not help me. Now I live.

King Kaka at the Cannes Film Festival in France in May 2019.

What does living life look like?

It is experiencing love and spending time with those who matter. I am intentional with family and friends. I hang out with my wife, and children and do movies with friends.

How do people show you love?

[Pause]. Genuine care, loyalty, and wanting the best for each other. You don’t even have to say it.

In showbiz, it is easy to be taken advantage of, fake friends and whatnot. How do you handle your kind of loneliness?

In Geography, there was a module that talked about contours. The first contour for me is God, then family, and colleagues. I place people in different levels of importance based on the love they show me. Nameless (Kenyan pop artiste) is my mentor, we meet and discuss family and business and I learn quite a lot from him.

What does fun look like to you?

Movies, travelling, and exploring new places. I love long drives and discovering the world.

Where have you gone that has stayed with you?

America, Estonia, London, and Sandton in South Africa.

What memory takes you to a particular place?

A few years ago, I started to doubt myself. Things didn't seem to work for me and people in the industry even reached out to me. Then a French alcohol brand reached out asking to work with me. I don’t drink but that didn't put them off. That event reinforced my belief that whatever is in your head just execute because someone is watching. I don’t hold back when it comes to dreaming.

What do you want to leave in your children?

Happiness. Each child has their path, and I want to support them in finding it.

What has being a father revealed to you?

The importance of being present. My children have a say in what I do.

What’s a special treat you do for them?

We have a special morning prayer which I hope they pass down to their children. I take walks with each of them, individually to find out how they are doing. I am teaching them the value of money. I learned that from my mother—she used to sell fruits, and I would help her count her money.

How are you raising your children different from how you were raised?

With more dynamism and awareness of modern challenges like social media. I focus on their happiness and adaptability.

What do you miss most about your childhood?

The carefree spirit and the simple games. We'd play games like dufa mpararo, feya, and sweets—the games. Childhood was worry-free. Now you have to be calculative.

How are you remaining childlike in your life?

I stay grounded and enjoy life without letting fame get to my head.

What’s your insecurity?

I’ve learned to stop seeking external validation. Happiness comes from within.  You don’t have to seek validation from anyone. You cannot please the world. Appreciate yourself.

What would I be surprised to learn about you?

I am partially deaf, and my left arm twitches.

Is that where you got your ear for music, if you can forgive the pun?

Yes, I hear everything, haha!. I protect my hearing at all costs.

What do you go through that few people get to see?

My mom is sick with lupus. She’s my best friend and raised us after my dad died when I was in Class 7.

How does growing up without a father affect your relationship with your children?

It made me more intentional. I had no manual, so I focused on the basics and what was right and wrong.

What are you apologising to yourself for?

Every struggle was worth it. The mistakes taught me hard lessons.

What are you thanking yourself for?

Never giving up and acting on my dreams. Extending my love and resources to others.

What is an absurd thing or habit that you love?

I collect alcohol, which I don’t drink, and snow globes.

When you think of the weekend what food comes to mind?

Chapo ndondo [chapati with beans] and kuku kienyeji.

What never fails to make you laugh?

I love standup comedy and documentaries. My favourite comedian, Njugush, always cracks me up.

What’s your superpower?

My mind and my heart.

What do you know that I should know?

You can do anything. Dream big and don’t be afraid to act on it.

I was in the ghetto today talking to a few guys and I could tell they are not ready for a paradigm shift. If I had the same mindset I would still be in Jericho and Kaloleni, just chilling. Dream, don’t be afraid. Now I am doing movies and heading to Hollywood for classes. This is just a child from Jericho saying if you dream you open more dreams for possibilities.

What will that boy in Jericho tell this man?

You are living the dream. You look impossible.

"Gen Z on a mission: 22-year-old’s initiative disrupting period poverty, one pad bank at a time","In 2021, Joy Kinoti, then a 22-year-old student at Meru National Polytechnic, embarked on a learning expedition to rural schools that brought her face to face with the harsh reality of period poverty.

A social worker by training, Joy resolved to take action to keep girls in class during their menstrual periods, leading her to found the Zahara Initiative.

""Zahara Initiative was founded to address the critical yet often overlooked issue of menstrual hygiene management,"" Joy explains. ""It was heart-breaking for me to learn that some girls compromised their safety to obtain sanitary pads, leading to a rise in teenage pregnancies in Meru.""

This year, Kenya marked Menstrual Hygiene Day on May 28, under the theme 'Making Kenya Period-Friendly,' underscoring the need for women and girls to manage menstruation safely and with dignity. Joy's initiative aligns perfectly with this goal.

""The stark reality that something as natural as menstruation could hinder a girl's education and future, and even jeopardize her safety, inspired the creation of Zahara Initiative to provide sustainable solutions,"" Joy elaborates.

In February 2024, the initiative launched an innovative program dubbed the 'pad bank' or 'pad dispenser' in public schools, aimed at increasing access to menstrual hygiene products for needy girls. It is designed to address emergencies and secure the girls' dignity when they experience their menses.

The initiative brings together 71 volunteers who contribute sanitary pads that are then given to girls. Joy also sources the pads from well-wishers and corporates.

""The organisation has been distributing up to five packets of sanitary pads to each girl, which last around five months,"" Joy explains.

""However, once these supplies run out, many girls revert to using rags or may engage in transactional sex to obtain more pads. The pad banks are meant to provide a continuous and reliable supply of menstrual hygiene products.""

Consistent supply

According to Joy, the program is also intended to promote menstrual equity and support the health and dignity of all students.

""Our pad banks are refilled regularly to ensure a consistent supply of sanitary pads for students. Each dispenser is restocked at least once a month throughout the school term, guaranteeing that the girls have uninterrupted access to menstrual hygiene products.""

Beyond promoting menstrual hygiene management, Zahara Initiative also seeks to reduce the stigma associated with menstruation. Joy acknowledges that a lot of awareness is needed to end the tradition of treating menstruation as a taboo.

""We conduct awareness campaigns in schools and communities to educate girls about menstrual health and break the stigma surrounding menstruation. This awareness is critical to ensuring girls are not stigmatised,"" she says.

Joy has called on the government to enhance resource allocation for the implementation of the Menstrual Hygiene Management policy through support for schools and making menstrual products more accessible.

""The government can provide free sanitary pads in schools, incorporate menstrual health education into the school curriculum, and ensure that schools have proper sanitation facilities,"" she suggests.

""Policy interventions could also include tax exemptions on sanitary products to make them more affordable.""

The Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy 2019-2030 seeks to address menstrual stigma, promote safe and hygienic management of menstruation, and ensure the safe disposal of used menstrual materials and products.

The transition towards clean cooking fuels and technologies,"Across a staggering 6,000 kms, two seemingly disparate meetings unfolded within days of each other.

In Paris, France more than 1,000 delegates, among them 20 African heads of state and government, the director general of the World Health Organization and COP29 host president gathered for the inaugural Global Clean Cooking Summit.

Organised by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the focus was on Africa's cooking systems, gender equality and the large scale fight for clean cooking in the continent. Meanwhile, in a Nairobi hotel, another meeting happened. Here, discussions stilted from investments, lived experiences to panels on the simple act of cooking a meal without jeopardising health or the planet.

Though separated by distance and time, these meetings were bound by a singular, urgent mission: to eradicate the insidious threat of indoor air pollution caused by unclean cooking practices.

For generations, the way we cook has simmered beneath the surface of the climate change conversations. For many, the familiar crackle of firewood or the glow of charcoal is ingrained in their culture. Some might even argue —  can anything truly compete with the taste of a meal cooked over open fires and hot coals?

A random casual office banter with colleagues made this disconnect startlingly clear. From one colleague to another, they shared their struggles to convince their parents to switch from firewood and other traditional fuels to cleaner, more efficient options.

“Each time I bring up the conversation, my mother is quick to remind me that she was brought up in a household that cooked all meals under an open fire. She doesn’t understand why she should switch now,” said one colleague.

But beneath that age-old belief lies a truth. Dozens of climate experts say that the way we cook is a contributor to climate change and a cause for preventable deaths.

Recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than two billion people cook their meals using fuels (crop waste, charcoal, coal, wood and dung) and kerosene in open fires or inefficient stoves. A majority of these households, WHO says, live in low-middle-income countries like Kenya.

WHO classifies firewood and charcoal as polluters. Clean cooking fuels that are safe for the environment and household use include solar power, cooking gas (liquefied petroleum gas), biogas and electricity from renewable sources like solar or wind.

Yet, for nearly a third of the world's population, a gas stove for instance is considered a luxury. For these billions of people, pre-industrial cooking methods remain the norm.  In the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), only five per cent of those in rural areas rely on clean fuels and technologies for cooking and space heating.

Cooking with polluting fuels, WHO said in a 2022 report, has a negative impact on health as approximately 21,560 deaths per year globally are attributed to indoor air pollution. This is due to the harms of breathing smoke from cooking fires (which often accumulate indoors).

At the France summit, a host of signatories including countries, civil society organisations and corporations issued a declaration “making 2024 the pivotal year for clean cooking.”

The convention concluded with 14 declarations, to which Kenya was a signatory.  “We declare clean cooking as a critical priority and pledge to take concrete steps towards advancing the clean cooking agenda, through action on the ground, raising awareness and fostering greater collaboration among the key stakeholders,” read part of the declaration.

The summit announced financial commitments of Sh260 billion pledges by governments and the private sector, with IEA saying they will ensure these pledges are delivered and will report on how the funds will be distributed and which countries will receive what portions.

The clean cooking revolution cuts a curious figure. While it champions cleaner air and a healthier planet, some argue it even piques the interest of unlikely allies —  fuel lobbyists themselves.  The revolution is also sparking a novel carbon offset market. Airlines and other polluters can now purchase ""cookstove credits"" to fund the upgrade from polluting stoves to cleaner alternatives in developing nations.

However, a recent study reveals that these credits might be significantly overestimating the actual emission reductions achieved by the new cookstoves.

What's the way forward?

Rebekah Shirley, deputy director for Africa at World Resources Institute, said: “To establish truly lasting and sustainable solutions, those most deeply involved in the activity of cooking — namely women who represent rural and peri-urban communities across the continent —  must be firmly and squarely established at the helm of the discussions and their perspective must directly inform decision-making.”

And in a move towards sustainable energy, the meeting in Nairobi sought to end cutting trees for cooking fuel.

The urgency for this transition is underscored by a recent commitment from the African Development Bank (AFDB) and the World Bank to electrify 300 million homes across the continent.

Bachi Balde, director of Power System Development at the AFDB, highlighted the critical need for clean cooking solutions.

Representing Dr Kevin Kariuki, the Vice-President of Power and Energy at AFDB, Balde said: ""We have over a billion people without access to clean cooking, and trees are being cut. But as far as we are concerned, clean cooking has to take the form of electricity or LPG. This vision is not just about environmental sustainability but also about addressing the severe health issues faced by women who inhale harmful smoke from traditional cooking methods.”

The AFDB has committed Sh260 billion (USD 2 billion) over the next decade to promote clean cooking through electricity and LPG. This substantial investment aims to eradicate the emissions and health problems caused by traditional cooking fuels.

""Electricity is a business. We are not just giving access to electricity for the sake of it, to light bulbs. It is access to electricity to drive all other areas, whether it's food processing or business,"" Balde added.

Kenya stands out in the electrification efforts with notable projects like Last Mile 1, Last Mile 2, and Last Mile 3, which have significantly increased the country's electrification rate from 27per cent to approximately 75 per cent. These projects are designed to extend electricity access to rural communities, fostering development and improving the quality of life.

The country is also home to impressive infrastructure developments like the Kenya-Ethiopia transmission line and the largest wind farm in Turkana, producing 300 megawatts of clean energy. These initiatives underscore Kenya's commitment to transitioning towards clean energy and addressing climate justice.

Despite these strides, challenges remain. Affordability and reliability of electricity are significant impediments.

Jackline Kimeu, climate and energy coordinator at the Worldwide Fund for Nature Kenya, pointed out that while power lines may pass through households, many Kenyans cannot afford to connect. Additionally, intermittent electricity supply in rural areas undermines the potential benefits of energy access.

“Energy is expensive. Even though the government has done a lot to ensure last mile connectivity, we still have Kenyans who cannot access it. We also have communities in rural areas that can go for a month or two without electricity. For energy transition to make sense to communities, it must be reliable, and because we say energy is an enabler of development, it cannot enable development if it is intermittent,” she said.

To address these issues, Kenya needs substantial investment—an estimated 600 billion dollars by 2050 to fully transition to clean energy. This investment is expected to create around 500,000 jobs, providing a substantial economic boost and making the transition more appealing to the populace.

Chibeze Ezekiel, coordinator of the Strategic Youth Network for Development in Ghana, stressed the importance of innovative financing to support the just transition. ""When it comes to clean energy or solar energy, there are job opportunities for building the system itself, installation and maintenance,"" Ezekiel noted. The clean cooking value chain can create numerous jobs, from production to sales, significantly benefiting young people.

Brian Motherway, head of the Energy division at IEA, urged governments and multilateral development banks to help reduce the cost of capital to make it easier to invest. “The vast bulk of growth in clean energy investment globally is coming in 10 major economies.

And for the rest of the world, it's moving far too slowly. And that is because there are barriers to financing in certain parts of the world, including this region. Costs of capital are higher than they are in other regions.”

"No, not all Gen Zs are lazy and don't care about work","An acquaintance I was having coffee with this past week to discuss work told me she was facing a recruitment dilemma. She said the post she is hiring for has been vacant for several months, and this was slowing down things in her department.

“What is the struggle? No good candidates?” I asked.

This acquaintance is in her late 40s and heads the marketing department of a top performing private company.

“Not exactly that. I am receiving applications from potentially good candidates but they have the wrong profile,” she said, confusing me.

Read: Remote work revolution: Kenyan Gen Z more focused on online jobs

She continued speaking when she noticed my blank stare. “I do not want to hire anyone born after 1992. Those guys are too much drama. Post 1995 born, even worse! They are lazy, can’t come to work on time and are extremely entitled.”

I kept quiet for a bit because I am among the people born in her rejected period. Eventually, I found the courage to challenge her thinking.

“So basically, you do not want to hire a youth. Do you honestly believe that people born after 1992 cannot be good employees?” I asked.

“Younger millennials are anxious job hoppers. They do not get their teeth deep into anything. Gen Zs do not even get me started. I have worked with a few. I have also seen what my colleagues who have them in their departments go through – random absenteeism from work, and overall unreliability,” she said in what seemed like a matter-of-fact tone.

Read: Gen Z care more about communication, dress code than work, money

Again, my argument is not that there are no lazy young people. My argument is that you cannot lump everyone in one box based on the experiences of a handful.

While researching a bit more to understand the origin of the stereotypes, I came across a 2023 study by the Pew Research Centre that surveyed adults between 18 and 34 in the United States.

The research agreed that, while in some ways, the younger generation is better than their parents’ generation, the young are less likely to own homes, have guaranteed pension and have stable employment.

Some commentaries even went further to say that the reason Gen Zs do not take their work seriously is because they know that regardless of what they do, they will not afford the quality of life that their parents have.

My brain was like, “Yeah! In America, Australia and Canada, maybe. In Africa, we are still dealing with first generation graduates in many families. So no, many young people here take their work seriously, and are going to be richer than their parents.”

Unfortunately, most people read such research or variations of it and begin to assess every young person they meet along these lines, branding them as this or that.

While having this conversation with my office desky, we realised the same way that we take in cultures, wholesale, mostly from the Global North, without critically examining them, is the same way we take in research findings without checking who was sampled.

Read: Babara Omwayi: The CEO who has decoded GenZ professionals

The result? We import conclusions about Gen Zs and late millennials from other places, mostly the Global North, and appropriate these findings in ways that are not fully applicable. Or in ways that only apply to Gen Zs or late millennials from elite families.

My heart breaks every time the murder of a young person is reported in the media. Usually, they are in their early 20s and university-going.

When their families are interviewed, they use words like “they were our only hope,” “they bore the promise of the family,” “they were going to be the first graduate in the family and lift us out of poverty.”

Such reports are the reason I would hesitate before agreeing with findings such as “young people are lazy”, “they do not care about work” or “they will be poorer than their parents.”

Research by Shujaaz Inc, that sampled 13,000 Kenyans aged between 15 and 24 found 100 per cent of this group has to earn money. Because of increasing financial insecurity, this generation has had to step up to help their families and households stay afloat. Let us not even talk about poverty levels in Kenya.

What negative stereotype(s) do you believe about young people, which you know you need to discard?

What's energy efficiency and how much can it help cut emissions?,"At the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) held in Dubai last November, countries pledged to triple global renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. This ambitious goal responds to the urgency of tackling climate change and transitioning to a sustainable future.

While expanding renewable energy sources is crucial, doubling energy efficiency is necessary to help hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Energy efficiency means using less energy to perform the same task – that is, eliminating energy waste. It is a multifaceted challenge, requiring a collaborative effort from various stakeholders to achieve this ambitious target.

Globally, we are at a crossroads. Population growth and economic development continue to drive rising energy consumption. However, our reliance on fossil fuels fuels climate change with alarming consequences. The need to shift towards cleaner energy sources and optimise energy use is undeniable.

While renewable energy holds immense potential, its large-scale deployment requires significant infrastructure development and time. Energy efficiency, on the other hand, offers a faster and more cost-effective solution.

Doubling energy efficiency is no small feat; the global energy landscape is riddled with disparities. Developed nations, often called the Global North, have historically consumed a disproportionate share of global energy resources. While their industries and infrastructure are usually more efficient than their developing counterparts, they still rely heavily on fossil fuels. Upgrading ageing infrastructure and transitioning to cleaner technologies will require significant investments and industrial restructuring. Developing countries, or the Global South, face different challenges. Millions of people in these regions lack basic access to electricity, hindering economic development and basic human needs. While renewable energy offers immense potential for these regions, financing and technological limitations can impede widespread adoption.

Furthermore, inefficient energy use in buildings and industries due to outdated infrastructure and limited resources further complicates the picture. Therefore, achieving our energy efficiency goals necessitates tailored solutions that address the unique circumstances of both the developed and developing worlds.

The path to doubling energy efficiency by 2030 necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving collaborative efforts from governments, NGOs, policymakers, community members and individuals.

Governments must lead in setting ambitious national energy efficiency targets, enacting relevant legislation and providing financial incentives for businesses and individuals to adopt energy-efficient technologies. This could include tax breaks for energy-efficient appliances, rebates for home insulation upgrades and funding for research and development of innovative energy-saving solutions.

NGOs can play a vital role in raising awareness about energy efficiency and educating consumers on making informed choices. They can also partner with local communities to implement energy-saving initiatives in schools, hospitals and public buildings. Policymakers must focus on creating a regulatory framework that incentivises industries' energy efficiency. This could involve implementing minimum energy performance standards for buildings and appliances and mandatory energy audits for extensive commercial and industrial facilities.

Community involvement is essential for long-term success. NGOs and community leaders should collaborate to organise workshops and campaigns that promote energy-saving practices within neighbourhoods. These could range from switching off lights in unoccupied rooms to encouraging carpooling and public transportation.

Finally, we as individuals have the power to make a significant difference in our daily lives. Simple actions like switching off lights when not in use, unplugging unused electronics, using energy-efficient appliances and adjusting thermostats can contribute to substantial energy savings.

Why should we prioritise energy efficiency?

Energy efficiency directly translates to reduced energy consumption, lowering energy bills for consumers and businesses. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth by freeing up funds for other investments.

From an environmental standpoint, energy efficiency reduces our dependence on fossil fuels, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Additionally, it lessens the strain on our existing energy infrastructure, reducing the need for new power plants.

We must fight gambling addiction,"A website that gives information on gambling in America has some stark statistics. QuitGamble.com’s Gambling Addiction Statistics and Facts 2024 indicates that 3 per cent American gamblers are struggling with a huge gambling debt, with 20 per cent of them filing for bankruptcy after losing all their money.

Interestingly, according to this survey, there are more women gambling addicts than men who struggle with gambling debts, at 78 per cent against 71 per cent for male addicts.

While these statistics sound distant and out of our immediate concern, Kenya is presently grappling with the unprecedented growth of gambling products whose popularity is growing courtesy of weak regulatory policies for the gambling industry, the Internet and mobile devices.

As Kenyan youth get enticed to chance their luck in betting sites and shops across the country, unknown to them is the fact that there are more losers in gambling than winners.

GeoPoll Survey 2022 puts Kenya in the lead ahead of South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Nigeria, in that order, with 82.81 per cent of the respondents in the survey admitting to placing bets.

Evidently, betting sites continue to grow their profit margins while in their trail leaving scores of broken relationships, school dropout cases and survivors of suicide who had bet what they could not afford to lose.

As images of handful of elated winners greet us on the screens in our sitting rooms, behind the curtains are hundreds of families dealing with mental health problems of their kith and kin, coming to terms with the reality of collapsed marital unions; and education dreams abruptly cut by bets-gone-sour.

Pathological gamblers

What many gamblers fail to appreciate is that betting companies are business entities after profit and not charitable organisations. Every betting platform has inbuilt advantages that ensure that they will always be the real winners. You just can’t win against the house!

QuitGamble.com 2024 notes that in America, 50 per cent of problem gamblers have committed crimes, 63 per cent have written bad cheques, and 30 per cent have stolen from their workplaces.

These challenges are duplicated locally in petty crimes as pathological gamblers raise money for gambling from all and sundry after they have even exhausted their chances for loans from mobile loan applications.

One notable finding in this survey is the fact that sports betting sites, casinos ad and slots games realise 86 per cent of their revenue from 5 per cent of the losers. This fact should get every gambler thinking and prompt the society to adopt measures to save the youth from drowning in the betting euphoria.

The reality of this matter is that gambling industry cannot be wished away. As gambling companies continue to rake in profits despite attempts at regulation, the society should also be putting up mechanisms to reduce statistics of the effects on society.

Besides government regulation of the betting industry, the society should invest in mentorship to stem ignorance and cultivate a sense of responsibility among the youth.

First, parents should begin to talk to their children, as soon as they clock teenage, about gambling and its risks.

Effects of gambling

The youth should be made aware that gambling is addictive and problems attributable to any drug addiction, such as truancy, lack of hygiene, crime and relationship problems are also attributable to betting and other forms of gambling.

Secondly, the youth need to be made aware of the fallacy that gambling is a form of investment. The street talk that a gambler, particularly betters in sports, are investors (wawekezaji) is not only misleading, but also dishonest.

They need to be taught honourable ways of making money other than hanging around betting shops idly awaiting the outcomes of their bets. Indeed, they need to be made aware that investment calls for innovation, patience and persistence which are critical virtues not only in investment but also in their general interaction with others.

Thirdly, the youth should be talked into enjoying sports without necessarily placing bets. They need to be taught that placing bets robs them of the thrill of watching the game, and that betting places them on the receiving end where the outcome of a game that is beyond their control carries dire consequences on their finances and subsequent relationship with the people or organizations that had loaned them the money.

This in itself is enough stressor and a risk to their mental health.

Lastly, the government, in addition to introducing more stringent legislation, should provide technical resources in terms of personnel to offer psychological assistance to gambling addicts and stem gambling addiction in the society.

The society needs to be sensitised on the effects of gambling, and resources availed to gambling addicts that may wish to overcome the challenge and lead normal lives.

We welcome all Kenyan hustlers to the KICC for ideas on how to eat cake,"The hustler government, through its National Assembly branch, hereby invite all hustlers to a public participation forum on Monday, June 10, 2024, at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC).

We have done this honourable gesture because we need more ideas to incorporate into our Finance Bill 2024, since we have been receiving a lot of noise that the ones we have published are not enough to siphon the money from the pockets of hustlers to finance the trips for our God chosen president to go take photos at a studio near him.

Hustlers coming to the KICC from far-flung areas are notified to start their great trek this morning, because the country is too broke to pay for their transport since all the taxes we collected last year was not enough to dredge a multimillion modern pavilion at State House and keep our prayer warriors praying for rain and spraying anointing oil to our police officers going to greet gang lords in Haiti.

Hustlers trekking from Chepareria in West Pokot are encouraged to stop for a water break in Kitale town as they wait for their friends coming from Kalokol in Turkana County so they can walk in marginalized groups to make it easier for highway patrol police to extract toll fees in groups as it is way cheaper and faster than if it was to be done individually.

The same travel advisory also applies to hustlers climbing up from down south in Lunga Lunga to use the shortcut via Ndavaya through to Chigombero as they will find their colleagues coming from Kilifi through Bamba waiting for them at Maji ya Chumvi bus stage.

On behalf of the hustler government, we would like to inform all Kenyans that we have been forced to revise our previous eating policy of biting more than you can chew to biting what you can chew, after several complaints from dental practitioners across the country reporting that there has been a meteoric increase in the number of Kenyans making inquiries about teeth braces; with the most affected government unit being the Kenya Police.

Definition of bribery

The hustler government would like to inform all Kenyans making their way to Nairobi for the public hearings on Monday to also remember to carry with them money for food and accommodation, as the government will neither reimburse them transport nor provide meals at the venue.

We have been informed by those who monitor corruption that the definition of bribery is not limited to inserting a Sh1000 note in your application letter to increase your chances of being shortlisted for an interview in the civil service, but it also extends to buying food for those coming to give you ideas on the best ways to milk a cow whose udders are drier than Mama Mboga’s wallet.

The hustler government have also been made aware that there are groups of Kenyans who have already arrived in Nairobi to acclimatize themselves with the venue and also get time to take pictures at Nairobi’s iconic sites and sounds that they previously only saw on television.

On behalf of the Nairobi City County Governor who has been busy rinsing his mouth with his opponents in the Nairobi Branch elections, we would like to wholeheartedly welcome all local tourists to the ninth wonder of the urban development world.

Do not forget to visit our Mathare demonstration site where we are showcasing how to evict people from their homes by shooting straight into their hearts like a cupid.

Our visitors who may not manage to make it to Mathare due to weak limbs and dry pockets are advised not to worry, since we also ensured they would not be left behind in soaking in the greatness of the mother city – that is where Gikomba demolitions come in.

Tax on loaves of bread

At Gikomba, right here under your noses along Landhies Road, you will meet former vegetable vendors holding kangaroo prayer gatherings crying to the Lord why He has forsaken them barely two years after wearing yellow aprons and celebrating how they will no longer share their loaves with sons and daughters of dynasty.

While we can neither confirm nor deny that this premature celebrations might be the motivation behind slapping a tax on loaves of bread in the Finance Bill 2024, we would like to inform all our local tourists not to forget to carry white handkerchiefs during their tour of Gikomba market for victims of the demolitions to autograph their tears.

There will be a basket going round in the heaps of prayer gatherings at Gikomba market that we have set-up for our local tourists during their brief stay in the city.

If you come across the offertory baskets, do not fear opening your wallet in public and dropping a few notes to pay for the tears on your handkerchiefs.

Tourists who desire to prank the police officers with an overhead kick are advised to see us behind the tent for us to prep them in advance before they remove their phones for Tiktok clout.

The Kenya Police exists to serve all Kenyans without fear of money so those who are afraid of gifting the police on duty should take a cue from the friends of our God-chosen president who came through for him when he was broke and wanted to travel to the United States of America to go bounce on President Biden’s chair.

All in all, the hustler government, through our arm in Parliament, wishes to welcome all trekking hustlers to the KICC on Monday to tell us which one of their organs have not yet been kicked by our tax police.

The hustler government is a listening government and we promise to finish the journey we started together in 2022 when you came out in large numbers to take an oath that you will die for us.

Taxes lead to closure of Nanyuki bike factory,"Unlike county revenue boards, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has coercive power. For example, they can issue an agency notice on you or your organization.

This allows them to get into your bank account and help themselves to what they think they are owed. Many County Governors are horrified when they find this out. I readily admit that I was too.

While Laikipia governor, I was dismayed when informed that KRA had an agency notice on us because we were 10 days late in remitting payroll taxes.

So, all the own source revenue that we were collecting that week was going directly to settle KRA.

As though to add insult to injury, KRA then issued a demand - Sh759 million in back taxes for the period when my predecessor was in office.

Unfortunately for KRA, upon election as governor, I had found trophies declaring Laikipia County as the best taxpayer for several years, so I asked them why they had issued the trophies, if there were such back taxes.

Still, they insisted and we ended up in the tax tribunal. The ensuing assessment concluded much to the relief of my government, that we should pay Sh3 million.

More recently, I was quite upset when KRA sent me an email, claiming that I personally owed them Sh15.9 million in pay as you earn, for the period I was Governor.

Wasteful and extravagant regime

It turns out that they had an internal reconciliation problem. Even the taxman can make mistakes.

Much to the dismay of all, these mistakes seem to be increasing. Under pressure from a wasteful and extravagant regime, the KRA is pushing Kenyans and their businesses hard for taxes. To this end, they have demanded that everyone uses eTims system to generate invoices and receipts.

KRA’s coercive power means they can tell you what to do. As everyone now knows, to ensure compliance, they have decreed that they will not recognize as costs for tax purposes any payments done without an eTims receipt.

Kenyans have been trying hard to comply. Except that eTims system is unstable, experiencing outages for days at a time.

KRA won’t say what is wrong, except that the system is down. Businesses are frustrated. Forced to go physically to KRA offices, most small businesses have been stranded for weeks.

With customers demanding eTims invoices and receipts, business is at a standstill.

Without cash flow, small businesses can neither pay taxes nor service expensive loans. It is no wonder then, that nonperforming loans are at the highest level since 2006.

Which leads me to Nanyuki. Tiger, the motorcycle assembler located there, is closing. Reports indicate that they are re-locating to Tanzania, citing taxation as the main problem.

Taxation has driven motorcycle prices from 70,000 to 150,000 shillings. The assembler had employed hundreds of people, now he has four, whose job is to sell off existing stock and close the factory.

Motorcycle assembly plant

Those who wish to be recognized as Mt Kenya kingpins attended a big hang-out last weekend. Popularly known as ngogoyo, the party is usually an occasion for the middle class to release steam over goat meat and muratina.

Usually held in the farmlands of Kieni and Laikipia, hundreds, sometimes thousands attend this musical extravaganza. For politicians seeking an audience, the party is an irresistible magnate.

This month’s edition was in a field in Nanyuki, about 100 meters from the Tiger motorcycle assembly plant.

You would think the matter of business closure would come up, seeing that senior regime leaders were gathered for merry-making just outside the factory. It did not feature.

Such is the disconnect of the current crop of political leaders with the economic realities in the Republic.

Drunk with what they think is power, they are yelling loudly, unhappy that the mountain region does not seem to notice their might, choosing instead to go to Limuru. But it is hard for businesses to notice while they are closing.

And matters will only get worse. The current medium-term expenditure framework calls for taxes to increase by 350 billion every year for the next three, the equivalent of 27,000 shilling for every adult Kenyan, working or not.

Amidst all this, the devolution fraternity is itself poised to gather later this month in a conference about own source revenue. The big difference with taxes is that most own source revenue is a fee for service.

Single business permits

Such fees are unlikely to lead to business closure. This fact is missed by the national government as well as development partners.

The state departments for trade, industry, cooperative and small business, think that it is county taxes and multiple licenses creating problems for business.

As a result, they design programs together with development partners to solve this imaginary problem. In the most current such program, the national government will attempt to persuade or coerce counties to eliminate the multiple licenses.

But if they cared to listen to Tiger, he will explain that he was the largest distributor of motorcycles in Mt Kenya region. And rather than importing the bikes, he chose to import some parts, machine others locally, and then assemble them.

The choice of Nanyuki was the centrality of the location. All his customers were within two hours of driving. Granted, he had to pay single business permits in more than one county.

Irritating yes, to have to pay ten thousand shillings in each of various counties, but he could live with it.

At first, his business was thriving. Every day trucks were lining up to load bikes. But the change in taxation, particularly the imposition of VAT on the bikes and their inputs, has doubled the price at which he has to sell the bikes, making him uncompetitive.

Sales have dropped off. After months of struggling, he has closed the assembly plant, and is selling the last remaining stock.

Release funds on time to ease education crisis,"Running schools and colleges is becoming increasingly challenging over the uncertainty on releasing funds to the institutions.

The school heads often have to juggle as the capitation is delayed and yet they need the money to operate smoothly.

Ideally, the funding should be released way ahead of the new term. But in recent times, thanks to the government’s own financial dire straits, the money never comes on time.

And even when it finally arrives, it is sometimes not enough. Many schools are heavily indebted, with the head teachers engaging in cat and mouse games with suppliers over pending bills.

With only three weeks to the end of the current financial year, the government has not yet remitted billions of shillings to schools and colleges.

This, of course, hampers their operations and undermines the delivery and quality of services in the education sector.

Withholding disbursements

The delays adversely affect secondary schools as well as the colleges offering technical and vocational education and training (TVETS) and the universities. This time, only primary schools have received their expected amounts.

Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu says the schools have so far received 50 per cent of the capitation this term and will get another 30 per cent, and the remaining 20 in the third term.

The principals dispute this. In the universities, some students have gone through a semester without receiving the amounts due to them.

The financial strain has hampered the disbursement of scholarships and loans, disrupting operations.

As a result of this crisis, there is unease in the schools and colleges, which, if not nipped in the bud, could degenerate into something ugly.

Since the money is often delayed and finally released, why can’t the Education authorities consult the National Treasury to ensure that the release of the funds the schools need is more straightforward?

Withholding disbursements until the end of term does not make sense at all. The money should be made available right at the beginning of the term for the smooth-running of the institutions.

Rugby needs support,"Kenya’s return to the World Rugby Sevens Series as one of the 12 core teams is testament to the immense rugby talent available locally.

That Kenya won World Rugby Sevens Series play-offs in Madrid on Sunday to earn promotion back to the top-tier competition after a season out speaks to the potential the country has in the shorter and longer versions of the game.

Kenya Sevens exhibited great resilience to win 33-12 against Germany, who had previously beaten them twice, and qualify for promotion to 2024/2025 World Rugby Sevens Series along with the United States of America, Spain and Uruguay.

Kenya had dropped down to the second-tier World Challenger Series after the 2022/2023 season, in which the team finished 15th overall.

Kenya’s promotion now means core teams from the World Rugby Sevens Series will tour the country to play in the Safari Sevens tournament, offering the much-needed high-quality opposition for local players.

More competitive series

But as we celebrate Kenya’s return to the top series after a season out in the cold, Kenyan coaches must realise that the World Rugby Sevens Series terrain has become more competitive and unforgiving.

World Rugby has reduced the number of competing teams to 12 from 16 starting last season.

Kenya will need to work hard to finish among the top eight out of 16 teams to guarantee their continued stay in the series.

Teams ranked between number nine and 12 will drop down to the play-offs at the end of the season.

Given that the team will also compete at the Olympic Games, Kenyan coaches have their work cut out for them.

They must utilise sponsorship from SportPesa, and support from both National Olympic Committee of Kenya, and the government to succeed. The coaches must identify a talented pool of players from tournaments to feed the team.

Norwegian Foreign minister speaks on Kenya-Somalia maritime border dispute,"Norway’s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide admits double standards of his country’s allies are hurting global peace bids, including in the search for peace in the region.

At a public lecture in Nairobi, Eide said he had been appalled at how some countries in the West spoke one thing today and violated it the next when addressing different conflicts.

Eide was speaking at the University of Nairobi on bilateral relations between Norway and Kenya, discussing both countries as “multilateralists and partners for peace and security in a divided world.”

He praised Kenya’s involvement in regional peace bids, arguing that a volatile neighbourhood could only attract a burden on Nairobi. But his arguments inevitably drifted towards current active conflicts such as Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

“I have been very vocal in criticising many of my Western friends for not being clear on this situation…Some say out there, actually many key countries, ‘Look, the principles are not applied equally across the planet, so there are no principles.’

“That is a dangerous path. The right way to say this is principles are not being applied equally around the planet so we have to make sure they are applied equally across the world,” he said, referring to the issues of Ukraine and Gaza, specifically.

Both have taken up global attention, but they have seen a varied, even contradictory response from Western powers such as the US, UK and Germany. While they rallied the world against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they haven’t been as energetic to limit Israel’s excesses in Gaza.

Eide said Israel failed to make a clear distinction between fighters, military and civilians and did not observe the principle of proportionality, which is you shall not use military force beyond what is necessary.

“We have a terrible suffering in Palestine inflicted by Israeli response to what was initially a terrorist Hamas attack in Israel, but all use of military force, has to be restrained by the rules of warfare, international humanitarian law and we feel Israel is in grave violation of these principles of international humanitarian law,” he said.

He steered clear of the genocide debate, however, indicating the case filed by South Africa against Israel should clarify the issue.

And he argued rules of war should apply equally to everyone, including appropriate punishment for those who break them. The US cheered when Russian leaders were indicted by the International Criminal Court but reacted angrily after Israeli leaders were indicted by the same Court. The US Congress threatened sanctions on the Court officials last week.

Norway, like Kenya, he argued, identifies development as based on a rules-based multilateralism. The current situation, however, has led to anarchy, with people acting while knowing they could dodge penalties due to their actions.

“We have been working closely with Kenya on the peacebuilding of Sudan and South Sudan and the Horn of Africa as well as the DRC and the neighbourhood around there. All these crises need our attention. They need a consistent and principled approach,” he said.

He did admit world attention focusing on the Gaza and Ukraine situations means other crises, especially in Africa, are being neglected.

Sudan’s war began earlier than Gaza’s, but the world also failed to mediate a ceasefire, leading to continual fighting to date. At least 18,000 people have died since then, as fighting between the Sudan Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces goes on.

Norway and Kenya have had diplomatic relations for the last 60 years. This year marks a commemoration of the ties as the two sides reflect on the challenges such as poverty and the Cold War to today’s, such as climate change, political instability and…poverty.

“These are the areas that are very crucial to mankind and require international cooperation. Sadly, this is affected by the return of geopolitical competition. We need to build trust in multilateral institutions in order to save lives, economies and help countries thrive because this also makes us thrive,” he said.

Eide used the occasion to clarify Norway’s role when Kenya and Somalia fought at the International Court of Justice over a maritime boundary. A Norwegian diplomat had tried to mediate long before Somalia sued Kenya and won at the ICJ. But rumours had also risen about Norway fueling the court case.

“We have no bilateral problems. On the contrary, we have a lot of common concerns about the world and about the neighbourhood,” he said of the rumours then. Norway had denied any ill role at the time.

“And I think what we will be speaking about is how we can further strengthen our cooperation on Sudan, South Sudan, Horn of Africa, DRC, but also on the global arena like UN reform and UN financial or international financial system reform,” he said.

Why Green Congress of Kenya party seeks to change officials,"The Registrar of Political Parties has published in the Kenya Gazette an intention to change officials of the Green Congress of Kenya (GCK) party, a move that would now hand the management of the outfit’s affairs to new individuals ahead of the 2027 elections.

“In exercise of the powers conferred by section 20 (1) (c) of the Political Parties Act, 2011, the Registrar of Political Parties gives notice that Green Congress of Kenya (GCK) intends to change its Party Officials as follows…,” states the gazette notice dated May 24, 2024, in part.

At least 17 officials of the party formerly led by ex-Rangwe MP Matin Ogindo have been affected by the new changes.

In the notice, Mr Ogindo was replaced as the party leader by former Homa Bay County senatorial candidate Mr Hilary Alila while John Ariwo was replaced by Vincent Omuono as the deputy party leader.

Ms Scholar Chelangat who was the party’s National chairperson will now be the deputy chairman and her position taken by Mr Thomas Mariwa.

Ms Scholar replaces Erick Oduor who was the party’s deputy chairperson in Mr Ogindo’s lineup.

The party’s secretary general will now be Jane Anika, replacing Mr John Omondi, while George Lando remains deputy secretary general.

National Treasurer

Ms Veronicah Mumbua has also been replaced as the National Treasurer with Ms Salome Gikonyo while the deputy treasurer is Ms Roseline Magak.

The new National Organizing Secretary will be Mr Richard Ojuka replacing Mr Straton Mbelewa.

Mr Mbelewa will now serve as Mr Ojuka’s deputy in the position.

Mr Ogindo, the former GCK party leader ditched the outfit in October last year for President William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance, handing the reins of the party to Mr Alila.

Mr Alila, who is the immediate former chairman of the Kenya Professional Boxing Commission (KPBC), took over the party leadership at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Nairobi on October 27, 2023.

Mr Ogindo announced that he would now pursue his interests under President Ruto’s UDA.

He said that since he had shown interest in UDA, it was no longer tenable for him to belong to two parties.

Mr Alila, a former senatorial candidate in Homa Bay County, said he would now take the party to greater heights with an eye on future elections.

“I will now focus on strengthening this party by recruiting more members and reaching out to like-minded parties on the best possible way to work and achieve our political goals,” Mr Alila said.

We are a party that transcends political divides, seeking partners and friends from all corners of the political spectrum, he added.

“Our goal is clear; to strengthen our party and lay the groundwork for a coalition that will propel us into government,” said Mr Alila.

He said; “building a coalition is not just about gaining political power, but about delivering on our promises, about solving real problems for the people we serve.”

He pointed out that the party will roll out a massive recruitment drive to get more members.

“We are a grassroots party, born from the dreams and aspirations of everyday people who believe in a better tomorrow. We are the party of the future, and it's time to create a path that leads us to the hearts and minds of the next generation of youthful, vibrant voters,” Mr Alila said.

Push for inclusivity

He said he will endeavour to push for inclusivity, “which the party’s foundation is founded on where all voices are heard and all perspectives are respected.”

“Our party stands for good governance, economic prosperity, social justice, and a sustainable future. We understand that the next generation of voters is deeply concerned about issues like climate change, education, healthcare, and social equality. We must address these concerns and work tirelessly to make a better world for all.”

He said the party will harness the potential, energy and ideas of the youth and provide them with opportunities to shape the future.

Mr Ogindo had been appointed by President Ruto’s administration as the chairperson of the Kenya Fish Marketing Authority.

The President has been keen on making inroads in Azimio leader Raila Odinga’s Nyanza turf by bringing in more leaders from the region to his fold.

ICT Cabinet Secretary Eliud Owalo and Interior Principal Secretary Raymond Omollo have been working with local leaders to improve the government's image in the region, which has largely voted for Mr Odinga for nearly three decades.

"Varsity student Ian Njoroge released on Sh700,000 bond","A university student charged with violently robbing a police officer of his phone and a battery, as well as causing grievous harm and resisting arrest has been released on a bond of Sh700,000.

Milimani senior principal magistrate Ben Mark Elhubi freed Ian Ngige Njoroge who had stayed in custody for five days.

Njoroge denied that he battered Corporal Jacob Ogendo on June 2, 2024. The incident elicited public attention after it went viral on social media.

While releasing Njoroge, Mr Ekhibi said bail is a constitutional right to every suspect.

He said the seriousness of an offence is no cogent reason to warrant the denial of a bond, even after noting the prosecution’s vehement opposition to the bond, after insisting that the offences Ngige is accused of attracts a harsh penalty.

Ekhubi said the charge of violently robbing a person attracts a death sentence upon conviction while the grievous harm attracts a life sentence.

“Seriousness of an offence is not a compelling reason to warrant the court to deny the accused bond,” ruled Ekhubi.

He said Article 49(1)(h)of the Constitution mandates the court to free the accused. The court warned Ngige against interfering with witnesses once freed.

He further noted that the issue of battering a police officer is an issue of notoriety and that the public is keen to see justice is done for the law enforcer.

Read: Inside police operation to seize motorist who assaulted officer

State prosecutors Victor Owiti, James Gachoka and Virginia Kariuki had opposed the release of the 19-year-old on bond.

Also, the victim’s lawyer Danstan Omari buttressed the prosecution’s request for denial of bond, saying the incident embarrassed the police service.

But Defence lawyers Suyianka Lempaa , Ken Echesa and Duncan Okatch pressed for Ngige’s release, saying it is a fundamental right to all accused persons

Njoroge denied three counts of robbing Corporal Jacob Ogendo of a mobile phone worth Sh50,000, a battery of police communication gadget, and resisting arrest.

The first year student at the Technical University of Kenya denied all the charges levelled against him before the Milimani senior principal magistrate Benmark Ekhumbi.

The magistrate heard that the accused committed the offence while in the company of others who have yet to be arrested and charged.

Njoroge is charged under Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code, which carries a mandatory death sentence upon conviction.

The student also faces a charge of causing grievous harm to the police officer.

Prosecutor Kariuki also filed a charge of resisting arrest. Beside the charges under the Penal Code, Njoroge also faces charges under the Traffic Act.

The accused has also been charged with obstructing other motorists while driving a vehicle registration number KDJ 207 P.

The traffic charge states that he did not allow the said vehicle to give access to other road users by making a U- turn on Kamiti Road at Mirema junction at around 8pm on June 2, 2024. He is also charged with carrying excess passengers in the said vehicle.

The student is said to have carried five passengers instead of four, thereby exceeding the vehicle’s capacity by one passenger.

He is further accused of disobeying verbal police directives to drive the said vehicle to Kasarani Police Station.

The charge further claims that at Quickmart Supermarket, he allegedly pushed the police officer in uniform out of the vehicle.

The prosecutor said police need time to present an affidavit explaining reasons for the bail denial.

“The accused herein was arrested on Monday and the Investigating officer needs time to record statements from intended witnesses,” said the prosecutor.

Defence lawyers Okatch, Lempaa and Echesa opposed the application by the prosecution to detain the accused for three days, saying his rights have been infringed.

“We are taken aback by the request to detain the accused for three more days to enable the police to come up with reasons for bail denial,” Okatch said.

Harambee Stars held by Burundi in World Cup qualifier,"Kenya dropped two crucial points after being held to a 1-1 draw by Burundi in a 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier on Friday evening at Bingu National Stadium in Malawi.

Second half substitute Duke Abuya gave Harambee Stars the lead in the 72nd minute after being picked out by Gor Mahia midfielder Austin Odhiambo.

The duo had come on in the 64th minute for Timothy Ouma and winger Clifton Miheso respectively.

However, a costly defensive mistake by Daniel Anyembe in the 85th minute saw Burundi level the scores via second half substitute Sudi Abdallah.

Following the result, Kenya remains third in Group 'F' with four points from three matches, same as Burundi.

African champions Cote d’Ivoire and Gabon, who were due to clash later on Friday evening, are joint leaders with six points each.

World Cup campaign

Gambia and Seychelles, who will clash on Saturday, are bottom of the group with no points.

Kenya now faces an uphill task in their quest to get their World Cup campaign on track.

Harambee Stars will face a bigger test on Tuesday when they host Cote d’Ivoire at the same venue.

Kenya hosted the game in Malawi since Moi International Sports Center, Kasarani and Nyayo National Stadium are currently under renovation.

The 60,000-seater Kasarani Stadium is undergoing refurbishment for the 2027 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) which Kenya will co-host with Uganda and Tanzania.

Nyayo Stadium, with a capacity of 30,000, will host the African Nations Championship (Chan) in September.

Missed opportunities

Harambee Stars started the game against Burundi well but wasted clear goal-scoring opportunities in the first half.

On the other end of the pitch, Kenyan custodian Patrick Matasi remained untroubled by the Burundians who largely employed a defensive strategy.

Early in the second half, Burundi were unlucky not to have gone ahead after Bienvenu Kanakimana raced past Rooney Onyango but his effort hit the post with Matasi well beaten.

In the 64th minute, Burundian goalkeeper Jonathan Nahimana tipped over Timothy Ouma's goal-bound effort.

That was the last action by the IF Elfsborg midfielder before coach Engin Firat replaced him with Abuya while Odhiambo came on for Cliftone Miheso.

The two substitutes would then combine well in the 70th minute to give Harambee Stars the lead. However, Burundi denied Kenya what would have been an important win with that late equaliser.

No compensation for Malindi family after police shot kin in raid,"The family of Rashid Sultan Timamy, a well-known contractor in Malindi, could have received millions of shillings in damages if it were not for the suspected terrorists he was harbouring in his compound.

His widow, Munira Mohamed, his brother Nassir Mbarak, and his nephew Sultan Ali had sought compensation for his killing that occurred seven years ago.

However, the case ended in victory for the State after the High Court in Mombasa ruled that the businessman's killing was justified after he shot and injured one officer during an operation to arrest him.

Mr Timamy was killed on June 28, 2016.

He was at the time involved in the house construction business under the name Texlive Construction Co. Ltd.

Evidence presented by his widow indicates that at around 8:45 pm, a group of armed individuals entered the deceased's residence. The businessman was present and working in his home office.

“In an attempt to defend himself, and the members of his household, the deceased rushed to retrieve his duly licensed firearm. In the process, he was shot dead by the people who I later came to learn were police officers,” Ms Mohamed said.

The officers proceeded to search the house until 11 pm before taking the woman to the police station for further interrogation.

""The deceased body was later released to me for burial,” he said.

The family then filed a lawsuit against the state, seeking various reliefs, including a declaration that Mr Timamy's right to life, inherent dignity, and equality before the law was violated by agents of the Inspector General of Police (IG).

“A declaratory order should be issued that Mr Timamy's right to freedom and security, as guaranteed in the constitution, has been violated as a result of the actions by the IG's agents,” they stated.

The petitioners also sought a declaration that Mr Timamy's right to privacy and equal protection of the law, as well as that of his family, had been violated.

“A declaratory order should be issued that Mr Timamy and his family are entitled to the payment of damages and compensation for the violations and contraventions of their fundamental rights and freedoms under the Constitution,” they insisted.

Mr Mbarak defended his late brother, describing him as a devoted family man and a prosperous businessman who focused on his construction ventures.

He further mentioned that his late brother possessed a valid firearm license, which he had obtained in 2005.

""The police acknowledged in a press release that they were responsible for the death of my brother, thus their actions violated the constitutional rights of the deceased and his family,” Mr Mbarak stated.

However, it is the testimony and evidence presented by the police that illuminated what truly occurred on the night Mr Timamy was fatally shot. Surprisingly, the police did not deny shooting the deceased, as they typically do, but explained their actions.

Chief Inspector Stanley Gitiobu of Malindi Sub-County Criminal Investigation Headquarters stated that the decision to raid the deceased's house was based on intelligence indicating the presence of terrorist operatives in a house within Malindi Town.

The Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) officers then formed a multi-agency security team for a sting operation at the specific house in the Sea Breeze Area.

“At about 10.30 pm, the officers entered into the deceased’s house. The deceased resisted the police officers by shooting at them using his shotgun. As a result, an exchange of fire ensued in which the deceased was fatally shot,” said Mr Gitiobu.

The deceased house was then searched, and Hamud Majid Hamud, who was armed with a Taurus revolver, was arrested. Mr Hamud fired at the officers, injuring Police Constable Joseph Waititu Wangeci.

Another suspect, Abdullaziz Ali, was also arrested at the scene. A third suspect, Imran Hassan, was later apprehended.

""Investigations were thereafter conducted, after which the suspects were arraigned before court,"" said Mr Gitiobu.

These three suspects were charged with terrorism-related offences.

Chief Inspector Benard Kilonzo, who worked on the case with Mr Gitiobu, clarified that the deceased was fatally shot after firing the first shot at the police officers, prompting the officers to respond in self-defence.

“Our investigations revealed that the deceased and others were involved in terrorist activities, thus putting the whole country in jeopardy,” said Mr Kilonzo.

He reported that had the deceased cooperated with the police officers, the exchange of fire would have been unnecessary.

The death certificate produced in court shows that the 41-year-old died of cardiopulmonary arrest.

Mombasa Resident Judge Olga Sewe who handled this case noted that the widow demonstrated that her husband was shot dead by the police but also conceded that the deceased and his nephew confronted the police officers with guns.

Mombasa Resident Judge Olga Sewe, who presided over the case, acknowledged that the widow proved her husband was shot dead by the police.

The court also noted that the widow admitted that the deceased and his nephew confronted the police officers with guns before he was shot.

However, the judge ruled that the evidence presented showed that the situation was delicate and that the use of force was justified under Section 49 of the National Police Service Act.

Justice Sewe ruled that the allegations of the deceased's rights being violated and the police acting unlawfully were not proven.

As a result, the judge dismissed the case without any compensation being awarded to the widow and her children.

Court of Appeal declines to lift orders suspending FKF AGM,"The Court of Appeal has declined to lift orders barring the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) from holding its Annual General Meeting pending the determination of a constitutional case filed at the High Court.

The orders were given Thursday, June 6 in Mombasa by Appeal judges Agnes Murgor, Imana Laibuta and George Odunga.

They stated that a constitutional case filed by Milton Nyakundi Oriku against FKF and its top officials takes precedence over any other case.

The three judges returned the case to Lady Justice Olga Sewe who, in April this year, suspended the holding of FKF’s AGM.

In the case before Justice Sewe, journalist Milton Nyakundi Oriku is challenging the legality of the current FKF officials in calling for the federation’s AGM, saying they acted in contempt of a High Court order issued in Kiambu.

They go for these wildlife because they don’t have domestic animals to rely on for meat and milk,” said Jacob Ilo Orahle, the Garissa County Senior Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) warden.The refugees, the majority being from Somalia, have settled in the Dadaab refugee complex, exerting pressure on local resources.“Giraffes are the most targeted because of their body size. It has more meat which the poachers sell within the refugee camp,” Orahle said.

We are carrying out public awareness to sensitise them on the importance of wildlife,” Mr Orahle said.Despite locals attributing poaching to some cultural beliefs in Garissa, Mr Orahle said there is no scientific research to prove that.“We have people talking of having improved sexual desire when they eat the giraffe meat. This is not true. These people are only killing giraffes for meat and nothing else,” Orahle said.

I tried it and I can confirm I was better,” he said hilariously.Mr Abdi Ibrahim, the chairman of Garissa County Ecotourism Conservation Association called for heightened surveillance in the area in efforts to curb poaching.“The cases of traditional hunters in the camps poaching the endangered giraffe are rampant and we will not hesitate to sensitise the community on the importance of protecting our natural resource,” he said.He challenged the local refugee host community to be vigilant and report poaching incidences.

It was white but not albino due to a condition known as leucism.Unlike albinism, animals with leucism continue to produce dark pigment in their soft tissue, hence, her eyes were dark.At least nine species are found in Africa and three in Kenya.The three are the reticulated giraffe, also known as the Somali giraffe, Rothschild’s giraffe and the Masai giraffe.Giraffes are killed for bushmeat, body parts and hides for the domestic and international markets.On August 22, 2019, the giraffe species were granted more protection under laws protecting iconic species during a resolution passed at the meeting of the 18th Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES CoP 18).Giraffes are listed on CITES Appendix II. The appendix includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction but in which trade must be controlled to avoid utilisation incompatible with survival.The proposal was put forward by the Central African Republic, Chad, Kenya, Mali, Niger and Senegal.

 ,"Sometime in March, residents of Modogashe in Garissa County received a distress call that two of their sons had been kidnapped in Libya.

Several videos of Shukri Siad Abdullahi and Idris Dubow Sheikhnoor being tortured were sent and circulated locally, forcing the community leadership to call for an emergency meeting.

“We gathered and as a community agreed to have every family donate a goat to this course,” Abdirahman Hussein, a clan elder, told the Nation on Friday.

According to Hussein, the captors were demanding Sh5 million before freeing the two young men.

The local community, with the help of politicians and other well-wishers, including locally based non-governmental organisations (NGOs), raised the money and it sent through the Hawala system.

Hawala is an informal method of transferring money outside of the conventional banking system. It provides anonymity in its transactions as official records don't exist, while the source of money cannot be traced.

Read: The harrowing journey through human trafficking

Hussein said the money raised was given to a local agent who sent the same to Magafe, a criminal network named after a Libya warlord who has made a business out of kidnapping immigrants heading to Europe through the Sahara Desert, from Garissa town.

Magafe means ""one who never misses"" in Somali language. Shukri and Idris were released but never returned home.

“We are hoping they are alive,” he said.

Notorious Magafe

Just before the dust settled, two other youth were kidnapped in Libya on their way to the Middle East in April.

The captors, believed to be the notorious Magafe, are still holding Ali Abdi Yussuf and Hassan Moge Ahmed.

“We don’t know where to get the Sh5 million the captors are demanding. We are reaching out to politicians and other well-wishers to come to our aid,” Hussein said.

During Madaraka Day celebrations at Modogashe on June 1, Hussein called on the local politicians to join hands and secure the release of the captives.

“We are having a problem of our youths being lured into a trap that leaves them held in Libya. We had two in March and we are having another two this month. The captors are demanding Sh5 million. Please help us set our youths free by raising the amount,” he said.

“We want the security agencies to investigate and arrest all the people involved in having our youths tricked into going to Europe (and the Gulf) only to be kidnapped in Libya.""

The counties of Garissa, Wajir, and Mandera have all reported cases of youth being held in Libya by the Magafe.

“Youth trafficking from this region to Libya is a serious issue involving complex transnational networks and significant human rights abuses,”  Simba Hasheem, a human rights activist, said.

""This illicit trade primarily targets young people seeking better economic opportunities but who instead fall into the hands of traffickers and criminal groups such as the Magafe.""

Read: Why Kenya leads in human trafficking

Since December, a family in Mandera has been raising funds to have their kin held by Magafe released.

Ismail Mohamed, aka Oscar Maley, arrived in Libya on December 15, 2023, and his captors called a day later demanding Sh1.5 million.

Sh800,000

“We only managed to raise Sh800,000 which was sent. He is still being held. He appears so emaciated in the recently shared videos. I am fearing for his life since we have been unable to raise the balance,” Mariam Abdullahi Hussein, a sister, said.

Youth from Mandera traverse Ethiopia and Sudan before reaching Libya, as those from Wajir choose either the Ethiopia route or, like their Garissa counterparts, use Nairobi, Busia to Uganda, then the Sudan route before getting to Libya.

“These journeys are often perilous, involving long treks through harsh terrains and encounters with various armed groups. Traffickers exploit the desperation and vulnerability of these youth, promising them work or safe passage to Europe but subjecting them to exploitation and abuse instead,” Hasheem said.

Social media

Sheikh Siat Kedie, a cleric in Garissa town, said it remained difficult to establish those involved in the trade.

“I have learned of such cases in the social media and community gathering but it is very difficult to know those involved because even the victims are not revealing how they find themselves in the wrong hands,” he said.

Mohamed Mwabudzo, Garissa County Commissioner, said despite public outcry on the issue, no single case had been reported to the authorities.

“We are just hearing about the issue in the public gathering but nobody has ever reported the issue with our security offices. We shall be forced to launch investigations into the same despite nobody having complained,” he said.

The Somali community at large is perceived to be secretive, and the victims and their relatives fear reporting the matter to police for fear of victimisation.

The Magafe network is central to the trafficking and exploitation system in Libya. This group operates with impunity due to the chaotic political and security situation in Libya.

Magafe is known for its brutal methods, including kidnapping for ransom, selling migrants into slavery, and other forms of exploitation.

The group's reach and operations are sophisticated, often involving collusion with local militias and corrupt officials.

After a Magafe is paid, he (mainly men) takes the immigrants across the desert to the coastline and hands them over to other human traffickers who still charge the travellers a certain amount of money to take them across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe through Italy.

Horses and camels

Magafe has grown to the point that they operate vehicles, horses and even camels to patrol the expansive Libyan Desert in search of immigrants.

In January, Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi revealed that there is a recruitment drive in northern Kenya disguised as military job opportunities in Syria, Israel and Russia, while in reality, the youth are being lured into joining militant groups.

“It is unfortunate that the youth from this region are being cheated that there are job opportunities to go and fight in Russia and Syria. We ask the parents to know where their children are,” he said then.

Anti-corruption chief magistrate Felix Kombo freed the MP stating that the evidence was improperly obtained.

The MP was charged with forging his academic certificates and presenting a false declaration form to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to be cleared to contest the 2013 general election.

The magistrate faulted the investigating officer for the manner he obtained part of the evidence.

Mr Sudi is accused of forging a diploma certificate in Business Management purporting it to be a genuine document issued by the Kenya Institute of Management.

Road to UHC - Universal Health Coverage isn’t free healthcare,"Most Kenyans heard that they would access healthcare services for free following the unveiling of Universal health coverage in October 2023.

A resounding commitment from the President as he assented to four health bills.

Then began the whispers of contribution payment with 2.75 per cent deductions from salaried employees.

The confusion set in when it was confirmed that contributions would not only be from those in formal employment, but those employed in the informal sector. For the latter group, the contributory process wasn’t clear.

It was apparent that Universal Health Coverage (UHC) would not be free, certainly not in the way most Kenyans had come to believe.

But what is UHC? Is it a vision, a mission or simply a campaign promise?

https://nation.africa/kenya/audio/why-kenyans-are-worried-about-the-uhc-rollout-4522284

As always in such cases, it is useful to start with a comparison with a country geographically not very far from ours, which has already succeeded in what we are now attempting. In this case, Botswana.

In sub-Saharan Africa, Botswana is a country that has attained Universal Health Coverage. Healthcare services are available at almost no cost to citizens.

Botswana’s health system remains dominated by the public sector with most services being rendered in public healthcare facilities.

The healthcare system is based on a primary healthcare model and according to Botswana’s Ministry of Health, health posts and clinics make up approximately 95 per cent of government health facilities.

Despite most of its population living in rural areas, people have access to public care. According to Unicef, an estimated 84 per cent of Botswana’s population lives within 5 kilometres of a health facility, while 95 per cent reside within a 15-kilometre radius of the nearest health facility.

According to a 2016 Health Policy Project funded by USAID, Botswana’s government funds the majority (57 per cent) of health expenditure with 54 per cent of government spending coming from domestic sources.

Therefore, reliance on donor funding isn’t as extensive, serving as both on and off-budget support.

Direct donor support is perhaps directed to program-specific initiatives such as HIV, TB and Malaria.

Healthcare infrastructure

While healthcare expenditure is also pooled through private healthcare insurance schemes, it was estimated to account for 39 per cent of the expenditure according to the report.

This means the out-of-pocket expenditure on health is minimal, estimated at less than 4 per cent. A stark contrast to Kenya’s healthcare expenditure breakdown where the majority is out-of-pocket.

Therefore, the country’s commitment to advancing healthcare is seen in its allocation of a significant portion of its budget to healthcare infrastructure.

According to the World Health Organisation, Botswana’s success can be seen in the establishment of an extensive network of primary healthcare facilities, focusing on preventive measures and ensuring essential services are readily available, including community outreaches.

Additionally, Botswana has made strong efforts to extend coverage under the public system to rural areas through mobile services. The current system of tax-financed health services has been successful in pooling risk, contributing to reductions in catastrophic expenditure and promotion of equity in health.

Botswana doesn’t have free healthcare, some services might be free, but most aren’t.

But the citizens enjoy healthcare services without having to sell parcels of land or travelling day and night to get care, as most do here in Kenya.

https://nation.africa/kenya/audio/unpacking-universal-health-coverage-setting-the-context-4510438

This brings us back to what is Universal health coverage (UHC)? As per the WHO definition, UHC means that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship.

It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.

Kenya’s progress towards UHC was marked by the enactment of four acts. These include the Primary Healthcare Act, Digital Health Act, Facility Improvement Financing Act and Social Health Insurance Act.

These ambitious healthcare reforms are meant to set Kenya on a path to Universal Health Coverage.

However, the regulation, operations and implementation processes remain to be the elephants in the room.

In this column, we seek to answer some of the questions on Kenyans’ minds and ask some of our own on this road to universal health coverage.

Shelter Afrique eyes capital boost as a development bank,"Pan-African housing financier Shelter Afrique is seeking institutional investors to bolster its capital standing after rebranding into a development bank last year, which allowed it to have an additional class of investors.

The revision of the lender’s article of association by its shareholders to elevate it to a development financial institution in October last year also allowed it to onboard private sector players, pension funds, commercial banks, and non-African financial institutions as its shareholders, but it is yet to get any so far.

The Nairobi-based continental lender is now in talks with multiple financial institutions including the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank and the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to onboard them as investors, according to its chief executive Thierno Habib Hann.

Others are the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa and some pension funds across the continent, which could soon inject more investments in the financier, lifting its capital base.

“That strategy will allow us to diversify our source of funding, and diversify capital of this institution, and that’s beyond our engagement with our current shareholders and other African countries that also want to join us,” said Mr Hann.

The lender’s shareholders, led by Kenya, its largest investor, will be convening in Kigali next week for the annual general meeting where the new article of association will be ratified, paving the way for admission of the new investors.

Shelter Afrique, founded in 1982 alongside the African Export-Import (Afrexim) Bank and the Africa Reinsurance Corporation (AfricaRe), has been struggling to boost its capital and shareholding, significantly lagging behind its peers.

It currently has a share capital of $500 million (Sh65 billion), while its peers Afrexim Bank and AfricaRe have a capital base of $5.2 billion (Sh673 billion) and $991 million (Sh128 billion) respectively as of the end 2022.

According to its latest financials, the lender made a loss of $11.6 million (Sh1.5 billion) in the year ended December 2022, forcing it to skip dividend payments for the seventh consecutive year. It last paid dividends in 2015 when it gave its investors $6.82 (Sh883) per share.



The Kenyan government is currently the largest shareholder of the financier with a 16.78 percent stake, followed by Nigeria with 15.74 percent and the African Development Bank (AfDB), which owns 12.11 percent.

It is owned by a total of 44 African countries, the AfDB and AfricaRe.

"Gatundu South MP Kagombe denies Thika boda boda rider murder charges, released on Sh1m bail","The High Court sitting in Machakos Friday released Gatundu South MP Gabriel Kagombe on a Sh 2 million bond or a Sh 1 million cash bail in a case in which he is accused of killing a boda boda operator at Thika Town in Kiambu County.

It was a huge relief for the MP who had been in custody for the last three weeks in connection with killing David Nduati Wataha on May 17. He pleaded not guilty when he appeared before Judge Francis Rayola.

The prosecution and the defence concurred that the MP is entitled to a bond. The two sides, however, clashed on the bond terms. The Director of Public Prosecution sought to have the MP barred from stepping into Thika Town, arguing that he risked interfering with witnesses. The victim lawyers also wanted the MP stopped from visiting Kiambu County as he would interfere with witnesses.

Mr Rayola barred the MP from visiting the Kimuchu area, Thika West Sub-county in Kiambu County where the incident occurred, and its surroundings.

Trouble befell the first term MP when he accompanied the National Assembly Majority Leader and Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungwah, Gatundu North MP Elija Njoroge, Thika Town MP Alice Ng’ang’a and other Kiambu politicians to commission a proposed market project a fortnight ago. He is accused of opening fire when two groups of Kiambu politicians and their supporters clashed over the proposed market project.

The four health bills driving Universal Health Coverage,"Kenya enacted four health bills that flagged off the journey to Universal Health Coverage (UHC). These included the Primary Healthcare Act, Digital Health Act, Facility Improvement Financing Act and Social Health Insurance Act.

Before this, healthcare contributions were made to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) with mandatory deductions for formal employees and voluntary payments from self-employed and informal workers.

These contributions financed public healthcare services as very few private facilities accepted NHIF or would require a co-payment method. The insurance penetration rate in Kenya is low at an estimated five per cent according to Kenya’s Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA). This meant that most Kenyans pay out of pocket for healthcare expenditure.

Facility Improvement Financing Act

Perhaps the simplest is the Facility Improvement Financing Act which provides for revenues collected from services or raised by public healthcare facilities to be utilised by the facility.

This facilitates independence and operational efficiency by allowing facilities to directly reinvest their generated funds based on needs. Three of the health Acts were to become effective in November 2023. The Social Health Insurance Act, Digital Health Act and Primary Health Act set the course to revolutionise the healthcare system in Kenya.

However, the High Court issued a conservatory order restraining the government and its agents from implementing or enforcing the relevant Acts of Parliament. A decision by the Court of Appeal in January 2024, lifted these orders which gave the green light for the Social Health Insurance Act to replace the NHIF Act.

The Social Health Insurance Act

The Social Health Insurance Act established the Social Health Authority (SHA) under which three funds have been created: The Primary Healthcare Fund, the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), and the Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund. All the funds, assets and other property held by the NHIF Board vested in the Social Health Authority effective November 22, 2023. The NHIF Board is required to wind up the National Hospital Insurance Fund within one year from the stated effective date but the National Health Insurance Fund Act, 1998 is repealed.

Primary Healthcare Fund and the Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund

The Primary Healthcare Fund and the Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund were to be financed by the government. SHIF is contributory, meaning that each citizen above the age of 18 years old and any resident of Kenya for over 12 months, would be required to make payment – either through monthly deductions if in formal employment or annual contributions for non-salaried households.

Financial risk protection

Some of the questions Kenyans raised included: Should they should stop making NHIF contributions? Why was there a fresh registration exercise? How was SHIF going to capture contributions from informal workers, most of whom survived on daily wages?

The importance of an education exercise became clear. It was no easy feat that the government was undertaking. To aid in clarity, Kenyans need to be aware that the Health Acts would first need regulations that would guide how the Act would be operationalized and implemented. The Social Health Insurance Act regulations gazette was issued on March 8, 2024. In the next column, we shall take a deep dive into these regulations and explain the deductions to be made from households with salaried income vs those without salaried income.

I urge you to remember that as discussed in the previous column UHC seeks to address three components. The first is access to health services where everyone who needs services should get them, not only those who can pay for them. The second is financial risk protection where people should not fall into debt paying for treatment and care. The third is quality, where services should be adequate and effective. It is a steep mountain to climb, but Kenya has a fighting chance. The three pillars of UHC are service delivery, financing, and governance. All three need to be addressed in parallel and this requires patience.

"Dorcas Muga: Despite my efforts, the women I cover choose to remain unheard","As a gender editor and self-proclaimed feminist, one of my key roles is ensuring the stories we publish reflect a balanced representation of voices across genders. I take pride in telling narratives that empower women and girls. However, I am also cognisant that true empowerment can’t come at the expense of neglecting men and boys. Gender inequality is detrimental to everyone in society.

The goal we should be striving for is achieving genuine gender equality by addressing the unique barriers and disadvantages faced by all genders. This means investing in the empowerment of girls and boys in an equitable, balanced manner that allows all segments of society to thrive.

Read: Why women struggle to speak up despite having seats at the table

My commitment to gender equality is driven by data that clearly shows women and girls still lag far behind globally, when it comes to the realisation of basic human rights. Empowering this half of the population is, therefore, critical for unleashing the full potential of societies and economies worldwide.

It is why I actively practise gender mainstreaming in my journalism work, striving to tell stories through an intentional gender lens that captures diverse perspectives.

Just last week, I was working on a national story and had secured what appeared to be a well gender-balanced list of sources to interview. I was excited at the prospect of having both male and female voices represented.

However, as I made the calls, I quickly discovered a concerning trend. All the men I reached out to were not only ready to offer their viewpoints for the story but were also enthusiastically willing to be directly quoted on the record and have their photographs published alongside the piece. In contrast, the process of getting the women to participate was an uphill battle.

One female source outright declined, seeming offended that I even had the audacity to contact her. She hung up on me without a second thought. Another also refused to speak, though she did offer to share contacts of other women experts, cautioning me not to reveal where I got their information from.

Read: The media as women’s ally in amplifying voices, championing inclusion

After two more failed attempts to get a woman's perspective, I regrettably resigned myself to publishing the story using only men's voices, despite my best efforts. As a gender editor, it was a deflating experience.

This situation highlights a harsh reality - despite our consistent advocacy for empowerment and equal representation, far too many women remain media shy.

Research indicates that globally, only 24 per cent of the people heard, read about or seen in newspaper, television and radio news are women. Just 19 per cent of experts providing commentary across news platforms are female. These imbalances deprive societies of the full diversity of perspectives needed to make fully informed decisions.

The reasons behind this tendency for women to opt out of public discourse are complex. Some stem from ingrained societal pressures about how women ""should"" behave - reserved, soft-spoken, and deferential. Even in 2024, being perceived as an outspoken or ""vocally powerful"" woman can still provoke a backlash.

A 2019 study found that women who spoke in a more exploratory, tentative style were viewed as more likable but less competent, while those who spoke more directly were seen as more competent but less likable. It's a harsh double bind.

Read: Making women’s voices heard in the media

Many women do not leverage public platforms confidently due to the harsh scrutiny, online abuse, and reputational attacks that statistics show they disproportionately face for merely expressing views publicly.

This fosters an environment where most of them simply self-censor and proactively opt out of raising their voices through media outlets.

This systemic exclusion, however, skews public discourse by allowing men's perspectives to overwhelmingly dominate and set the agenda across a vast array of topics - from politics, to economics, to social policies with far-reaching impacts. It perpetuates the marginalisation of women's experiences, priorities and problem-solving capabilities in crucial decision-making spheres.

To correct this situation, there is a need for vigorous public awareness campaigns that dismantle deeply entrenched cultural attitudes demeaning outspokenness in women. Both women and men have roles to play in decisively rejecting these outdated, harmful mind-sets.

We need robust initiatives providing empowerment training from girlhood through womanhood that build fundamental skills and confidence around unapologetic self-promotion.

Established female leaders and influencers should intentionally sponsor, mentor and amplify other women to expand the diversity of visible female voices across all platforms.

And male allies must consciously advocate for, demand and celebrate the equal representation and amplification of women's voices and perspectives in shaping dialogues across all sectors.

Only through such comprehensive actions can we dismantle the systemic barriers that still keep far too many women's insights, experiences and ideas marginalized in our private, institutional and public spheres.

Gender equality necessitates that all voices have an equal opportunity to be heard, respected and valued. It is not a zero-sum game. An empowered woman is an empowered society.

"More trouble for muguka, miraa farmers as petition to ban crops presented in Mombasa County Assembly","More woes for muguka and miraa farmers as the Mombasa County Assembly receives a petition for enactment of the law banning the sale and consumption of stimulants within the port city County under Standing Order 201(1).

The petitioners, led by the community elders, clerics, parents, and Mombasa residents, want the assembly to enact a law prohibiting the sale and consumption of miraa and muguka in the port city.

“Further the petitioners have asked the County Assembly to take action on the matter adding that based on evidence, muguka and miraa contain stimulating alkaloids mainly cathinone and cathine,” said the petitioners.

Read: What the science says about muguka

They said cathinone and cathine, which are classified as controlled substances according to the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and are classified as second schedule in Narcotic and Psychotropic Substance Act 1994 of Kenya,” said the County Assembly.

The petition was committed to the Committee on Health for further deliberation.

“They shall in not more than 60 calendar days respond to the petitioners as per standing order 201(2),” they added.

Coast leaders continue to attack Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire over her remarks regarding the stimulants.

Early this week, Mbarire claimed that muguka affects coastal youth because they add other hard drugs like heroin.

“This is ridiculous because cocaine is one of the most expensive drugs in the world and heroin is injected and smoked, not chewed. Governor Mbarire you are dead wrong. Yes, muguka is a variation of miraa, but it's a more lethal brand,” said East African Legislative Assembly Member of Parliament Suleiman Shahbal.

Shahbal said school children chew muguka because it is cheap.

“You know it's time to take drastic action. No amount of emotional outbursts will stop this. Someone else's economic prosperity cannot come at the expense of the mental health of our people,” added the politician.

He said Meru and Embu have rich soils and perfect weather to farm avocados and macadamia nuts, which are ""profitable and healthy.""

The MP urged Coast leaders to fight the muguka and miraa battle in court and at the National Assembly.

“If all else fails then tax it so high that it will become unaffordable. This is not just a coastal issue, it is a national problem now. We do not want a generation of stoned youth. We should also start an educational campaign to wean our users away,” said the MP.

He further urged parents to stop chewing muguka.

“It is hypocritical to stop children while you are using it yourself. Just say no,” said Shahbal.

Two weeks ago, Coast Governors, including Abdulswamad Nassir (Mombasa), Gideon Mung’aro (Kilifi), Andrew Mwadime (Taita Taveta) and Issa Timmamy (Lamu) banned muguka.

However, the ban was lifted by the Embu High Court pending a hearing.

Governor Fatuma Achani (Kwale) later imposed hefty charges.

On Thursday, the Coast governors turned down an invitation to meet Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mithika Linturi to discuss the ban, citing bias.

They said Linturi is constrained in being an impartial arbiter on the muguka ban.

Instead, the leaders led by their Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani, a Coast economic bloc chairman, Mung’aro demanded a sitting with President William Ruto.

This is after Linturi publicly pronounced himself on the Constitutional and legal positions taken by Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita County Governors to ban Muguka (Gazette Notice 6482 of Executive Order NO.1 of 2024). According to your statements dated May 29, 2024, on the Ministry's position.

The Coast Parliamentary Group also accused President  Ruto of double standards by pledging Sh500 million for the growth of the crop.

Coast politicians from across the political divide including ODM, UDA and PAA have accused President Ruto of discrimination after meeting the leadership of Embu County led by Mbarire, following the ban of muguka by three Coast counties.

Ruto has also faulted the ban on muguka by Coast governors, saying the crop is legal in Kenya.

Muguka is a variety of miraa and is a scheduled crop by the Crops Act 2013 and the Miraa Regulations 2023.

President Ruto urged stakeholders in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to convene a consultative forum to address concerns raised and agree on the implementation of the Miraa/Mũgũka Regulations 2023.

“The future of Miraa/Mũgũka is in scaling up farming, aggregation, grading, pricing, packaging and value addition of the crop. For this reason, the government has committed to allocate Sh500 million in the 2024/25 Financial Year for value addition of these scheduled crops. The Government affirms its commitment to the fight against drugs, illicit brews and other illegal substances,” said President Ruto.

East African Legislative Assembly MP Hassan Omar, who is also UDA party vice chairman, said the Coast community will not allow intimidation.

“It is malicious for politicians from Mt Kenya to defend their people and economy while selling others a stimulant at the same time-fighting alcohol addiction. We will ensure muguka is not sold in our region,” he added.

Kilifi North MP Owen Baya said the Coast region will not be forced into consumption of the stimulant, which has side effects for the users.

The politicians said they would not allow intimidation by leaders from other regions who are closer to power than them due to the tyranny of numbers.

“We are also in government. But others think they are closer to power because they have access to the President and can talk to him anytime, and he makes a decision that favours another region should know that we are immune by the Constitution against whatever kind of discrimination whether at the executive level,” said Baya.

Mombasa Senator Mohammed Faki said Coast leaders will not attend a meeting called by the Agriculture Cabinet Secretary on Thursday this week at Maanzoni Hotel.

“Mr Linturi is not an independent person, he is impartial because miraa and muguka are cultivated in his neighborhood. We cannot discuss the crops with him as the chair. Secondly, when the President met Embu leaders, he ought to have also called Coast leadership, but he decided he disregarded us,” said Faki.

Gachagua gets Raila backing on revenue formula,"Raila supports One Man, One Vote, One Shilling approach to revenue sharing

Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition leader Raila Odinga has thrown his weight behind the ‘one-man, one-shilling, one-vote’ revenue-sharing formula.

Mr Odinga said the formula that is being championed by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua would ensure revenue is allocated on the strength of a region’s population.

He said that was his position during the Building Bridges Initiative constitutional referendum attempt that failed.

Speaking at Chungwa House in Nairobi where he received a document detailing the Limuru III Summit resolutions, Mr Odinga said the formula is the way to go.

“I am not a populist but totally agree with ‘one-man, one-shilling, one-vote’ conversation. This means you actually take count of the number of people in a region,” he said.

Mr Odinga’s stand has given Mr Gachagua a powerful ally against criticism by some leaders from arid and semi-arid regions.

The DP has been criticised for “propagating a revenue sharing formula that ignores the fact that most geographically vast counties have more financial needs”.

Mr Gachagua has dared Mt Kenya leaders opposed to him to come clean on the formula.

“You need to ask your leaders to make their position known on the push for the ‘one-man, one-shilling, one-vote’ national revenue sharing formula,” he said in Nyeri on Wednesday.

The DP told political leaders in the region to listen to the ground and conform to the requirements and aspirations of the people, saying it would aid in the unity quest.

During the debate last month, the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) said giving money to counties on the basis of population, rather than geography, is not practical.

The commission maintained that no county had proposed the ‘one-man, one-shilling, one-vote’ principle as a parameter for allocating resources, adding that the allocations are meant to facilitate equitable development for every region.

“From a professional point of view, the ‘one-man, one-shilling, one-vote’ is just one parameter. The country cannot use it to allocate national resources.

“We are not going to consider that because it never came from any county,” CRA commissioner Hadija Juma said.

Uasin Gishu Governor Jonathan Bii also dismissed the proposal as untenable.

Mr Bii said Kenyans have a right to equitable sharing of national resources, irrespective of where they are.

“How will this revenue-sharing formula accommodate the interests of a large-scale farmer who cultivates vast tracts of land to provide food for the rest of Kenyans?” Governor Bii asked.

Leaders from dry counties in the north, northwest,northeast and southeast parts of Kenya have vowed to fight for the ‘one-vote, one-kilometre, one-shilling’ formula.

The leaders from Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Samburu, Kajiado, Baringo, Lamu, Narok and Tana River counties are up in arms against the formula being spearheaded by the Deputy President.

Former Senate Speaker Ekwe Ethuro said pastoralist regions contribute significantly to the country’s politics and economy.

“We are going to call for the ‘one-man, one-vote, one-kilometre’ revenue sharing formula. We are dismayed by a resurgence of retrogressive political ideologies,” Mr Ethuro said during the leaders’ meeting late last month.

New collar jobs: The growing appeal for entrepreneurship among Kenyan youth,"With hundreds of thousands of graduates being churned out every year into a shrinking job market, many young Kenyan professionals are finding themselves unable to find employment after graduating.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), at least seven million Kenyans are unemployed, with young people accounting for 70 per cent of that figure.

Consequently, the number of young people turning to business has increased significantly.

Despite some stereotypes and expectations from family members and society that hold white-collar jobs in high regard, entrepreneurship has proven to be a viable option for many jobless graduates.

Wanjiku Muriithi, 28, graduate of public relationsSells cereals Wanjiku knew exactly what she wanted to be when she graduated from Karatina University in 2018 with a Bachelor’s degree in communication and public relations – a PR specialist.

But this was not to be, as she applied to several jobs but was never hired.

Rather than mope over her state of unemployment, Wanjiku relocated to Nakuru and opened a barbershop, which, after seven months, collapsed.

She claims that the barbershop’s location was not ideal, and that she lacked experience managing the business, which she co-owned with a friend.

“My partner and I sold the barbershop for Sh80,000 and we split the proceeds equally. Those funds served as my starting capital when I entered the cereals business. I purchased a bag of rice from my mother, who had a similar shop,” she says.

Wanjiku thought it wise to put her PR and communication skills to use, so she turned to social media to market her products. According to her, this decision completely changed the trajectory of her business.

“I began by selling just pishori rice when I started my business in 2020, and it worked well. Later, I met someone who was already in the cereals industry. Seeing tonnes of goods in his store inspired me. I opened a cereal store in 2022 as part of my diversification plan, and the business is still standing,” she says.

In addition to the popular product, pishori rice, Wanjiku has since added many cereal varieties as well as honey to her store. She gets her clients through recommendations, in-person visits, and online marketing. She targets people who buy for home consumption as well as those who buy to resell.

Wanjiku gives online marketing credit for enabling her to succeed in the competitive business.

Wanjiku believes that the food industry is profitable since every human being needs to eat.

“I source for premium products and deliver clean, well-sorted cereals to my customers on time. My shop is located in a strategic location, making it easy to net customers.”

She acknowledges that there are challenges associated with the industry, including con artists, attacks by weevils, and excessive rain which occasionally ruins the cereals.

Wanjiku advises everyone, including fresh graduates, to start where they are with what they have, and not to be picky when it comes to jobs.

“Be confident and steadfast in your quest for financial independence. My goal is to go into commercial farming and become a major national supplier of honey, pishori rice and cereals at wholesale prices,” she notes.

Wanjiku concludes that she has no regrets about missing out on a career in public relations and that her focus is now firmly on her business.

Victor Nyaoga graduate of film production

Freelance photographerOn the streets of Nakuru town, you might spot a group of youths standing with cameras slung on their shoulders, ready to click and have a shot towards a better life.

Victor is one of these photographers. He says he had to snap out of the fantasy of getting a white-collar job after he failed to get a job after graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in film production and animation from Multimedia University.

“As a self-employed photographer, I cover events, outdoor photo shoots, and on the streets to get random clients. I chose this path after giving up on finding a job”, he says.

As a teenager, Victor was always fascinated with fashion. During his university years, smartphones had just started becoming popular. He would dress up and ask his roommate to take photos of him on his phone, which he shared on social media.

“Campus life was difficult, but I was determined not to rely solely on my parents for support. My father boosted me by buying me a Tecno phone and a Nikon d5200 camera, which were my first pieces of equipment.”

To monetise his passion for photography, he decided to try to broaden his horizons by utilising his equipment, developing his brand, VICEYE, and charging his classmates Sh50 for every picture.

“My passion for street photography started when I organised intercampus outdoor sessions on weekends to draw students from other campuses to visit our school since Multimedia University was large and had a good ambience for photos and large walkways.”

Victor notes that the process of looking for an office job after completing his studies was hectic and draining, and when he failed to secure placement, he moved from Nairobi back to his hometown Nakuru, and resolved to dedicate himself to photography.

“Compared to Nairobi, street photography was not so popular in Nakuru. Whenever I went to town, I would carry my camera, walk around the streets looking for well-dressed individuals, and request them to take a picture.

Since then, Victor has established himself as a successful street photographer, and has since served over 5,000 clients. He has also collaborated with some companies in Nakuru.

“Thanks to my camera, I have entered places I never thought I would. The biggest challenge in photography has always been the equipment. They are quite pricey. The industry has also become highly competitive due to the large number of photographers and their ability to offer high-quality work at lower prices.”

From events to fashion shoots to weddings, business gatherings, and family portraits, Victor’s target market is diverse.

“We charge Sh250 for an outdoor street photo session and up to Sh100,000 for corporate events. The future looks incredibly bright and exciting. I have no regrets, what I do is better than sitting idle at home.

Kennedy Ndung’u Wairimu, 30, studied computer scienceDope Empire EntertainmentAfter high school, Kennedy completed his CPA-K and IT diplomas before pursuing a computer science degree at Pwani University.

However, he was compelled to drop out in 2018 while in his third year due to financial difficulties. He worked as a disk jockey (DJ) in Mtwapa under the stage name DJ DOPE 254 before joining campus.

“When I realised I couldn’t afford my college fees, I chose to work as a Master of Ceremony (MC) during campus events to earn money. I also worked with corporates like Imarika Sacco and other private organisations at the Coast.”

Kennedy had the same career dream as most young graduates – he wanted to become an IT guru.

He opened a cyber café in a bid to pursue this dream, but he eventually closed it.  He believes his struggle to find employment stems from the fact that he lacks a college degree.

“I have been self-employed for four years now, and my main priority is to grow my business and build my brand. I collaborate closely with my friends because I have not yet acquired all the necessary tools. Purchasing a laptop, DJ equipment, microphones, and sound system is my immediate need. My business is called Dope Empire Entertainment, and it allows me ample time to spend with my loved ones.

Kennedy acknowledges that there are challenges in his area of work, but says he has no intention of looking for a white-collar job given the high unemployment rate in the country.

“I want to give all my attention to building my brand. With time, I hope to work with a wider range of clients,” he says.

Even in these hard economic times, Kennedy says he provides for his family comfortably.

He advises young people looking for white-collar jobs to use their skills even while studying because one never knows where their destiny lies.

“Don’t just sit back and complain, do something and God will reward your hard work.”

Elsie Omondi Netia, 32, diploma in graphics designReach Prime PR AgencyElsie acknowledges the frustrations of job hunting. She graduated in 2011 with a diploma in graphics design from Graffins College.

“I was brought up to believe that the most competent candidate usually gets the job, but I quickly found out that networking mattered more than knowledge. I could fill a library with the number of regret letters I have received while looking for a job.

“Unfortunately, it matters more who you know than what you can do for the client. I have always known that I wanted to run my own company as a CEO, but I was not sure about the field. I tried my hand at fashion since I have always enjoyed it, but I eventually changed my focus to public relations and communications,” she explains.

Elsie runs a communications and PR agency, Reach Prime, based in Nairobi which she launched in 2017, specialising in digital brand strategy and digital communications for SMEs. She is in the process of launching a second PR firm.

“I enjoy what I do, and I pay my expenses too. I have been able to move my family to a better neighbourhood and send my children to school thanks to my work.

“I say to anyone who can listen that the world has changed. You cannot just wait for a job, you must expand your network and build your CV,” she advises.

Franklyn Andiavo, 25, IT diploma Mobile barber

Like every young graduate, Franklyn had lofty aspirations of becoming a pilot, physician, or lawyer. Now, looking back, he believes those were his parents’ aspirations and not his own.

“As I grew older, my passion for beauty, fashion, and grooming increased, which is how I ended up becoming a barber. Yes, I tried to find a job especially in the IT field after I graduated with a diploma in Information Technology from Aviation College, but luck did not favour me despite my numerous applications.

However, this turned out to be a blessing for him as it pushed him to focus on his business.

“I decided to become a barber as I needed a source of income and also because I realised how much I loved fashion and grooming. I run a mobile barber service that is like Bolt or Uber, but for haircut services. My clients can get my number through my social media platforms and call me, then I go to their locations to render the services.

“I carry all tools of trade in my bag, which includes a foldable mirror, a camp chair, and a rechargeable shaving machine,” he says.

Franklyn has been a mobile barber for a little more than a year, and a barber for more than four years. He says he enjoys his work and finds it satisfying to watch clients’ confidence soar after receiving a haircut.

He claims to have lost track of the number of clients he has served over the years, but he finds fulfillment in the affirmations and praises he receives from those who become new friends or develop ties with him as a result of his haircuts.

“My business pays my bills, but at the moment I am investing in new equipment to expand my clientele. In addition, I sell watches and branded merchandise such as Tshirts and sweatshirts online. I co-own this company with a friend. It’s called Sydney Collection,” he explains.

He encourages young people to embrace self-employment because technological breakthroughs like AI and machine learning are automating many jobs.

“Start your own business instead of waiting for traditional jobs.”

"Victoria Kimani: My parents have never approved of my music, until now","Victoria's bold fashion statement complements her vibrant music, making her a standout figure on and off the stage. In this interview, she reveals how her Christian upbringing continues to shape her art, and how her Kenyan heritage and international experiences influence her unique sound.

1. What inspires your music and how do you write your songs?I draw my inspiration from my own experiences and those of other people. My creative process is quite spontaneous. I like to be in the studio and have jam sessions with other musicians, and produce music on the spot. I also like listening to instrumentals and just yielding to the mood of the moment.

Most times my song writing process isn’t pre-planned. I could just be out doing something and an idea comes to my head, so I record a voice note.

If I’m doing a collaboration and we are in different countries, my collaborators and I record each part and then send it to each other on email, and then the engineers put it together and make a song. But I prefer being together with my partners in the studio and working on the project jointly.

2. Your music beautifully blends different cultural elements. How do your Kenyan roots and international experiences influence your music?I am Kenyan, but of a unique type because I was born and raised in the US. I moved back to Kenya in 2013 so my outlook is a little different from that of my other siblings who were born and raised here. Even though we have slight differences, I try to incorporate my Kenyan culture into my music. My upcoming album cover was shot in Lamu. In my work, I try as much as I can to show that I didn't grow up in privilege, I just understand things differently and I appreciate the country’s beauty even more.

I see Kenya as very colourful, vibrant and extremely beautiful. I am a nature lover so even showing landscape in my music means a lot to me. I also make sure I use Swahili words in my songs. Kenya is a melting pot and I find Kenyans to be very diverse people.

3. You have quite a unique fashion style, how have the American and Kenyan cultures influenced it?My mum was very flashy. How she dresses is very reflective of her perspective as an African woman in America. You know how flashy Africans can be if they want to. My mum always wanted to look smart, whether she was picking me up from school, going to church or even grocery shopping, so I think that’s where my bold and unapologetic side of fashion comes from. Also I didn’t have to wear school uniforms, so most times I got to choose what to wear to school. No one dictated that for me.With that background, I can express myself through what I wear. I have never felt the pressure to wear the same thing everyone else has on.

4. How does your Christian background affect the type of music you write or sing?I started by writing songs for other artists in the US. Nobody cared whether we were making Christians or secular songs, in the studio the producers just wanted us to make good hits. There were no restrictions. I do believe in God and that He is in control of everything, and my fifth album, I felt like I needed to put some lyrics that would uplift and empower people, and let them know that my talent is from God.

There will be a gospel record on my upcoming project but even the other songs, I still recognise God. I was keen about that. Coming from a Christian family, despite doing pop music, I felt I had the responsibility to avoid dragging people into the gutter or leading them towards destructive things. I also did a gospel EP with five songs and sent it to my parents and they are excited about it. For the first time they are involved in my music and they want me to release it. I don't think I have had their support in my other projects.

5. You’ve worked with many artists across various genres. Which collaboration has been the most memorable for you, and why?About eight years ago, I did a song with Ferre Gola titled Tucheze after he visited Kenya. Seven years later, in June 2023, Ferre had a concert at one of the biggest stadiums in Congo (Stade des Martyrs), and he insisted I perform. He said the song Tucheze helped revive his music career after a hiatus. That was my first time performing in Kinshasa, and I was blown away by their love for music. It was the biggest crowd I’ve ever performed for, and the support was overwhelming. It was a life-changing experience. So, Ferre Gola is definitely my most memorable collabo.

"Why women with disability have a right to inherit, own land","Recently, I interviewed a paralegal who fights for the rights of persons living with disabilities in Kisumu County.

In her strive, she commits to securing their inheritance, often violently and disgustingly taken away by relatives.

Of the many questions angered relatives throw at her is: “This woman is disabled, does she even deserve to own or inherit land?”

She said communities see no value in women with disabilities. They consider them useless and undeserving of property ownership.

But what does the law say about their rights to land and property ownership?

The Persons with Disabilities Act (2003) does not expressly affirm the rights of women with disabilities to own or inherit land, but Article 40 (1) of the Constitution dictates that every person has a right, either individually or in association with others, to acquire and own property.

Further, no one is allowed to deprive another person of property or right or interest in any property on any ground, including disability and gender. This is prohibited in Article 40(2b) of the Constitution.

The Law of Succession Act (Cap.160) doesn't discriminate. Nowhere does it mention that a spouse or a child with disability is not entitled to either life interest or inheritance.

Read: Why it's not enough for women to own land

Neither does the Matrimonial Property Act (2013) provide for such parameters in case of a dissolution of marriage.

Unfortunately, there is no data on women with disabilities owning land in Kenya.

Instead, Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (2022) tells us that by 2022, 75 per cent of women did not own agricultural land. Neither did 93 per of them possess non-agricultural land.

In reality, the country has more disabled women than men, which implies that in the event of applying the discriminatory principle, the women will suffer the most.

According to the 2019 census, of the 900,000 Kenyans with some form of disability, 2.5 per cent are women while 1.9 per cent are men.

Why is land important to women with disabilities?

“Granting rights to land to women who are disabled is essential for their wellbeing, economic growth and overall social stability,” points out Dr Robert Wayumba, a senior land tenure specialist at Landesa, which promotes pro-poor and gender-sensitive land laws across the world.

He further reminds communities that “land is a fundamental source of production that enables people to feel secure in their belonging rights to a particular place, to grow crops, food and nutrition, and even to trade in land as an economic product.”

As grounded in the Constitution’s Bill of Rights, respecting the rights of women with disabilities to own land and property is honouring and protecting their human rights and fundamental freedoms as a means of preserving human dignity and promoting social justice, he says.

What can be done to enable women with disabilities access and own land?

Dr Robert exemplifies how that can happen:

“Something good happened recently in Kakamega County. A disabled daughter finally got her inheritance.

“Years ago, Nafula* lost both her parents. She was born with a physical disability. Her father died first, followed by her mother. Immediately after the burial of her mother, her only uncle, the brother to her father, moved into their home, and took over everything: cows, chickens and land.

“Years later, a local paralegal, who had been trained by several civil society organisations in securing women's land rights, heard of her plight, and took it upon herself to help Nafula.

Read: This is the gendered impact of amendments to the Land Act

“The paralegal approached several government officers and relentlessly pursued the case.  She helped her through the land succession process involving the police, chief and various government officers. Finally, she obtained a title deed and now Nafula is a proud land owner.”

How land can change the lives of women with disabilities

Dr Robert says research has proved that women who have secure rights to land have a greater ability to contribute to the family and society welfare.

“The odds that a child is severely underweight are reduced by half if the mother owns land,” he says.

“And when women in the household have land rights, children have higher levels of educational attainment.”

"Kenya is a victim of greed and incompetence, not climate change","The dust will soon settle on what has been one of Kenya’s worst flooding disasters. The dust should not settle, but it will, because our collective national amnesia and myopia will see to it. We will forget, then get something else to preoccupy ourselves with temporarily. The recent floods will soon be the latest addition to our overflowing list of national ills that we have chosen to accept as the new normal before tragically moving on.

Perhaps the floods will sit in a corner somewhere with endemic corruption, poor customer service in public offices, and the elusive national healthcare system, or maybe it will prefer the company of last year’s prolonged drought, another phenomenon we have long forgotten.

One of the reasons why the flooding will soon be forgotten with not much corrective action is because it was largely labelled a climate change disaster and left at that. Leader after leader blamed climate change, not just for the excessive rains and flooding, but also for the destruction, loss of lives, displacements, damage to infrastructure and crops, and the looming food shortage.

Those that were badly affected were tersely comforted with the stark reminder that they were but the latest ‘victims of climate change’. And therein lies the problem. The dangerous implication of saying we are ‘victims of climate change’ is that it gives the impression that this is something out of our hands, that it is but a natural disaster, that it is ‘God’s will’, and there is nothing we can do about it. It is a dangerous implication because it gives the perfect cover for leadership to say, ‘Our hands are tied, this is climate change, you know?’

While the extreme weather events manifesting through excessive rains, floods, and drought can be attributed to weather variations and climate change, is it accurate to attribute the destruction that befell us to climate change? How about the hundreds of lives lost, disease outbreaks, thousands displaced, billions in infrastructure destroyed, and the collective billions lost economically?

When the weatherman warns us in advance of extreme weather events and we are still caught flat-footed, should we still blame climate change for our woes? Should we accept and laud the subsequent uncoordinated response, the knee-jerk reactions of evictions and midnight demolitions as the best we can offer as a people? I believe not. Until we have an honest discourse on the root cause of the problem and our collective complicity in it, we will soon be staring at a biting drought, followed by another flooding, which shall find us yet again unprepared.

I believe we are victims of greed, corruption and indecisive, incompetent leadership. All these have subsequently stood in the way of building resilience and adapting to the effects of climate change over the years.

How else do you explain Nairobi, the gateway to East and Central Africa, having almost a non-existent drainage system? How else do you explain contractors and developers issued with licences to build on riparian land? How else do you explain hotels and resorts given the green light to build on riverbeds? How do you explain entire towns and cities mushrooming with no clear planning and contingency measures?

How about all the apartment buildings put up with the sole intention of rent collection, but zero investment in drainage systems? How else do you explain the encroachment of rivers, lakes, and oceans by businesses and settlements? And how do you explain, that even after such heavy rainfall and flooding, we shall witness water shortage and that crops will wither for lack of water?

It is not enough for us to wag our tails and point fingers at climate change. We are not helpless. And while certain aspects of adaptation and building resilience may be capital-intensive, a lot of it doesn’t have to cost a dime. It’s all a matter of doing the right thing, decisively and radically so. That responsibility lies squarely with the government, and with all of us. We must resolve to be the generation that does the right thing. The generation that will restore the environmental equilibrium and harmoniously co-exist with nature. Because it’s the right and wise thing to do. And because it is the only way.

Fix mess in stadiums once and for all,"Everything hangs on them, but little changes. For many weeks and months over the last five years, stadium closures have dominated sports life.

This publication ran a series on the state of sports infrastructure for more than a year, which cast a timely spotlight on the various stadia across the counties, leading to the closure of many of them amid furious and frantic construction works.

The highly dramatised standoffs between contractors and the government due to lack of pay, unmet deadlines and use of substandard material notwithstanding, the venues were closed, and everyone – athletes, footballers, boxers – suffered.

Unsurprisingly, when the frenzy was over, we discovered we had solved almost none of our problems.

When the “renovated” venues were reopened, we found out that besides new paint, gawky seats, and new mirrors in the changing rooms, little else was changed or added.

And oh, the excuses! When Kasarani stadium was closed for months and reopened, it still couldn’t host any match of repute there because there were no floodlights, contractors said they had forgotten that “small” detail.

When Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos was renovated (that word again) and the running track began peeling off two weeks later, contractors said they had no choice but to work with the materials available.

Borrow stadium facilities

In an unusual turn of events, the old track proved better than the one newly laid.

So much for renovations, huh?

But the venue that continues to get the rawest deal of them all is City Stadium, primarily because no effort has ever been made to renovate it.

Tok Komwanda, the ancestral home of the Mighty K’Ogalo and the most convenient stadium for football fans based on its location, has been neglected and remains in ruin for more than a decade now.

These scenarios combined to see Kenya stripped of the chance to host the African Nations Championship.And now, as we prepare to co-host the Africa Cup of Nations in two years’ time, the frantic efforts are back.

Kasarani and Nyayo are closed, and Harambee Stars have had to host their matches against Burundi and Cote d’Ivoire in Malawi.

What a shame for a country like Kenya to borrow stadium facilities from a country with a much lower GDP, but you don’t have to look far to understand why.

The chaps in Nyasaland know the value of sports and have their priorities right, simple.

National shame

I make no apology for holding the government and all sports administrators’ feet to the fire on this, no matter how uncomfortable it might make some.

Harambee Stars will miss the crucial home advantage in the twin matches on Friday and Tuesday, yet a qualification to the 2026 Fifa World Cup is at stake.

Who misadvised the government to close all the national stadiums? What is the government doing to ensure we don’t ever have a repeat of this national shame?

Bear in mind that even if renovations weren’t ongoing in the two stadiums, neither of them could have been okayed to host the World Cup qualifiers as they were both unapproved by CAF because, even after all those renovations in the last half a decade, they still do not meet international standards.

Anyway, I wish the home boys the very best today against Burundi.

Mexico's first female president reignites hope for Kenyan women in politics,"Claudia Sheinbaum has once again written the history books, this time as Mexico's first female president. This landmark achievement is her second significant milestone. In 2018, she became the first woman to serve as mayor of Mexico City.

In a nation grappling with high levels of gender inequality, Claudia, representing the Morena ruling party, won by a record margin, defeating opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez. Remarkably, both women are engineers by training. For the first time in Mexico's history, two women went head-to-head in the battle for the presidency.

She joins a select group of women who have broken the glass ceiling by occupying the highest public office: the presidency. Her victory, though distant from Kenya, has renewed hope that a similar breakthrough could happen in a country that still heavily lags behind in gender equality. But first, who is Mexico’s first female president?

Read: Sheinbaum elected Mexico's first woman president

At 61, Claudia walked in outgoing President López Obrador's footsteps, proposing to continue the ""Fourth Transformation,"" a movement aimed at eradicating neoliberalism, which she sees as the main cause of economic and social inequality in Mexico. Dubbed the ""defence coordinator of the Fourth Transformation"" by her predecessor, Claudia promised to build upon its foundations.

She was born and raised in Mexico City and was greatly influenced by her father, a chemical engineer and her mother, a leftist academic active in global movements. Naturally, Claudia's interest in politics took root early, with her activism and opposition to neoliberalism tracing back to her university days in the 1980s. While studying physics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, she joined a student movement that championed public education, successfully opposing reforms aimed at raising tuition fees and privatising education.

To date, she criticises neoliberalism for commodifying welfare. Running on a platform focused on public education, she assured Mexican citizens she would improve high school graduation rates by building schools, providing financial aid, and enhancing teachers' working conditions.

It was also during that time that she met her first husband, Carlos Imaz, who co-founded the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), headed by outgoing President Obrador in 1996. After completing her bachelor degree, she worked as a researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Institute of Engineering, where she focused on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This culminated in her earning a doctor of philosophy in energy engineering, and authoring over 100 articles and two books on energy, the environment, and sustainable development. Her scholarly work even contributed to a 2007 Nobel Peace Prize-winning report on climate change, underscoring her credentials as a climate scientist.

She was later appointed as Environment secretary by outgoing President Obrador in 2000. Her political career took off in 2015 when she was elected mayor of Tlalpan, a town south of Mexico City. In 2018, she broke another barrier by becoming the first female head of government of Mexico City, coinciding with Obrador’s presidential victory. As mayor, she established more daycare centres, countering then-President Obrador's policy of defunding the centres. According to the feminist organisation Intersecta, violence against women in Mexico City decreased by 32 per cent during her tenure.

She achieved this by implementing reforms such as staffing prosecutor offices with more female lawyers trained in gender issues, providing a six-month stipend equivalent to the minimum wage for domestic violence victims, and allowing women to remain in their homes while the men moved out, regardless of property ownership. Claudia plans to implement these measures nationally.

Beyond gender issues, she expanded the capital's infrastructure network, constructed universities and hospitals, and established new educational and cultural centres in impoverished communities. High-impact crimes decreased by 50 per cent during her tenure.

Her predecessor, Mr Obrador, achieved significant successes, including raising Mexico’s minimum wage, expanding social programmes for people over 65, and investing in infrastructure in the poorest regions. These accomplishments have led critics to argue that Claudia is not as popular as Mr Obrador and less at ease with large crowds. Despite this, she expresses confidence in her scientific background. In an interview, she recalled spending her early days as Mexico City mayor poring over spreadsheets on her laptop.

Read: Women's leadership crucial to sustainable development

While Mr Obrador often neglected environmental issues, Claudia, with her scientific expertise, is expected to prioritise climate policy. During her campaign, she unveiled a renewable energy strategy and committed to promoting electric vehicles and increasing the use of solar panels.

As she takes on the highest public office in Mexico, Claudia, who describes herself as a social feminist, is expected to address numerous challenges, including weakened public finances and replicate her successes at the national level as other women leaders have done before her in other countries.

Globally, we have witnessed significant strides made by women in steering vital reforms and ensuring efficient governance. Examples include Angela Merkel in Germany and Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović in Croatia, who transformed the socioeconomic landscapes of their nations.

Uniquely qualified

Isuzu Motors East Africa Limited CEO Rita Kavashe says women are uniquely qualified to address complex issues such as climate change. She argues that authoritarian leadership escalates conflict, as seen in situations like the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza.

“The world needs the unique qualities that women bring to leadership, such as collaboration, empathy, risk management, and communication. These qualities are often rooted in the fundamental aspects of daily life and home management. Women's skills in these areas are crucial for developing strong communities and homes, showing how deeply women are wired to contribute to societal development,” she told Nation.Africa.

In Africa, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia stands out as the first democratically elected female head of state on the continent. She played a crucial role in empowering female political and economic leaders and safeguarding her country in the aftermath of the civil war. Closer home, Sahle-Work Zewde became the first woman president of Ethiopia in 2018, while Samia Suluhu is the first female president of Tanzania.

Kenya, on the other hand, has never had this privilege. This is not for want of effort. Three women have attempted to become presidents so far: Charity Ngilu in 1997, Nazlin Umar in 2007, and Martha Karua in 2013. None has succeeded.

This is why many leaders have welcomed Claudia Sheinbaum’s win as a beacon of hope for gender equality in Africa’s political landscape. Tanzania’s President Suluhu took to Twitter to extend her congratulations to Claudia on her historic win and wished her the best on her upcoming journey.



Dr Githinji Gitahi, the Global Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Amref Health Africa, sees her win as a demonstration of how gender stereotypes at the grassroots can be overcome.

“For a country like Mexico, which only granted women the right to vote in 1952, to have two female presidential candidates and the winner being a woman is a major victory for the gender equity and feminist movement. Kenyan politics, too, will need to mature beyond gender stereotypes—it's not the women who have a problem to be fixed, it's our systems in society, political class, and government that need to lift the barriers for women to have an equal chance as men,” he told Nation.Africa.

Dr Githinji adds that Claudia’s win reaffirms the need for male allies on the gender equity journey, as the outgoing President Obrador openly and loudly supported Claudia.

Amnesty International Kenya Executive Director Irungu Houghton also called upon Kenyans to abandon gender stereotypes and “prioritise candidates with leadership integrity, management experience, and a commitment to everyone's human rights, which will expand the space for women’s political inclusion.''

Dorothy Ooko, the Head of Communications and Public Affairs at Google Africa, says Claudia’s historic victory resonates in Kenya, inspiring hope and reminding women of their potential to break political barriers.

Martin Ochieng, Sasini Plc’s Group Managing director, was elated by Claudia’s historic win, taking the moment to call upon Kenyan politicians to catch up with the private sector in terms of gender parity.

“It's great news to see female leaders. Even though Mexico is far from Kenya, such achievements inspire leaders in Kenya. The fact that women can run against each other in elections shows advancement in other countries. There is nothing stronger than female leadership; it strengthens women leaders and demonstrates that leadership has no gender,"" he said.

Phyllis Wakiaga, senior adviser (Global Lead), Industry and Commerce at Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, called on Kenyan women leaders to draw inspiration and replicate Claudia’s effectiveness in nation-building.

“As women, we have the capacity to understand the diverse needs of society, ensuring that all citizens' requirements are met. Addressing areas such as education, healthcare, sustainability, gender inclusivity, and economic and political influence are key avenues through which Kenyan women leaders can achieve greatness,” Phyllis stated.

On the other hand, Executive Director of Crawn Trust Daisy Amdany says time for a woman president in Kenya is upon us, though barriers still persist.

“The challenge in Kenya is not the people but the dominant male elite controlling the political landscape. Political parties are often owned by powerful individuals, often men, who manage election processes and outcomes. They can decide to give direct nominations and reach consensus, but these are often biased. Women are frequently excluded from leadership pipelines because of this male dominance,” she says.

She, therefore, encouraged women to put their differences aside in the next election cycle and rally behind a strong woman candidate.

“Mexico had one of the most violent elections in its history, yet a woman emerged as a winner. Leadership is not given; it is taken. Women need to move away from a mindset of begging for positions,” she said.

However, Kenya women leaders reiterate that they are not sleeping on this opportunity. While hinting that running for president is a possibility for her, Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo assures Kenyans that plans are underway to achieve the dream.

“Even though President Ruto promised that his next deputy would be a woman, we as women leaders are strategising. Male MPs are good at advertising and branding themselves, but we, women, go about it differently. We are currently focused on finding the best candidate and strategically positioning them to run for president.”

Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru adds that she draws inspiration from trailblazers like Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Joyce Banda, the second woman to become president in Africa.

“Claudia's success is a powerful reminder that consistency, perseverance and dedication can lead to revolutionary achievements in supporting women's leadership. Her triumph motivates us to champion and nurture the next generation of women leaders in Kenya and beyond,” she told Nation.Africa.

In Kirinyaga, woman representative Jane Maina’s words show that Claudia’s win is a testament that patriarchal narratives are slowly wearing out.

“Closer home, we have several women who have set the pace and contested the country’s top seat: The Martha Karuas and Charity Ngilus of this nation. I look at their run as a dream deferred, for we will definitely have a woman taking the top seat in the foreseeable future. In a full-circle way, female leadership has come of age and I am here for it,” she concludes.

Cleft lip repair: Healing a child’s smile and a mother’s heart,"Alot has changed since Esther Kalekye, 29, became a mother six years ago. On a particular day in July 2018, the day she delivered her firstborn daughter, the word “cleft lip” held the weight of a thousand unspoken anxieties. She remembers crying and bombarding healthcare professionals with questions, desperately seeking clarity about her medical condition.

Fast forward to today. Esther sits confidently on a plush armchair in a doctor's office, awaiting her daughter’s review after a recent surgery. When she talks about cleft lip, the mother of two does it with the practised ease of a seasoned physician, her sentences peppered with terms like “nasal reconstruction” and “speech therapy.”

Yet, a lot goes back to the day she had her daughter as it was also the first time that she heard about cleft lip and palate. Despite being a common birth deformity with a global incidence of one in every 1,000 live births, Esther knew nothing about clefts.

“I had never met or even seen anyone who had one. When I returned to my village — Kyumbi in Machakos County — after a two-week hospital stay, I realised that it wasn’t just me who didn’t know about it. The people here didn't know about it either. Even as I was desperately trying to understand my daughter’s condition, I had to explain it to others ,” she says, a touch of sadness tinging her voice.

Dr Tom Osundwa, a consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon and a senior lecturer at the University of Nairobi, has been involved in paediatric surgeries and carried out dozens of cleft lip and palate operations for years.

“In the early weeks of pregnancy, typically around five weeks of pregnancy, the face starts to form from different sides and the parts come and fuse. In cleft lip and palate, there is a lack of fusion or meeting of the parts of either the lip or the palate, resulting in a gap,” he explains.

According to the Centre for Diseases and Prevention, the severity can vary, with some babies having a small notch in the lip while others may have a wider separation.

“This gives a facial appearance that is grotesque and normally has implications on function. So, because of that, smiling, speech and chewing may be affected. Sometimes, it can also impact hearing. And basically, the impact is beyond that because the face is an important corridor to many things,” offers the surgeon.

Even as Esther continued to figure it out, not knowing what it would mean for her baby, the more pressing issue was that the baby couldn’t latch properly.

“It was a lot to deal with. On one hand I was trying to wrap my head around this whole cleft lip and palate thing—a phrase that kept bouncing around in my head. On the other hand, all I could hear was my baby’s cries. She was getting frustrated and struggling to feed. Then, to top it all off, back in the village, people couldn't help but ask questions. “Why isn’t the baby gaining weight?” They would ask, their words well-meaning but landing a little harsh on my already stressed ears.  Word went out and after three months, which seemed like a lifetime to Esther as she describes it, her baby was booked in for a cleft lip surgery.   “After six months, we went to the hospital again to correct her palate. I knew that the sleepless nights were behind us,” she offers.

At the hospital, doctors recommended that her baby only consumes fluids. “It was a big financial burden to provide her with the required diet because I don’t have a stable source of income,” she says.

Dr  Osundwa says there is a correlation between cleft lip and malnutrition. “What we see in some patients is iron, zinc , folic acid, vitamin B6, B12 and B3 deficiencies,  and they are all associated with cleft lips. This is especially reflected in the high prevalence of clefting in the lower socioeconomic status.”

Over time, the baby developed further complications  attributed to poor management of the wounds and even after gaining the required weight, doctors needed to observe her before taking her in for another surgery.

“When her case was brought to our attention, we discovered that the initial surgery was not properly done and because of the wound that had formed, we had to book her for another operation.  However, we had to first monitor her weight and haemoglobin to ensure that it was up to par. This is a journey that took about two years. Ideally, All this should have happened before she turned one year old, but we are doing it when she is almost turning seven years old,” says Joseph Kariuki, senior programme manager for Eastern and Southern Africa at Smile Train, an international children’s charity.

In Kenya, for instance, Mr Kariuki says the organisation conducts at least 800 surgeries every year.

“And I think it could be more, but there are challenges. Because we currently do not have enough medical personnel to be able to provide this care. And more specifically the cleft surgeons. And when you look at cleft care, there is a whole ecosystem. This includes nutrition, speech therapy, orthodontics, psychosocial support, oral health,  (ENT) Ear, Nose and Throat and audiology. So,  there is lack of professionals and the issue of funding. This has created a backlog and we are trying to address it through training and capacity building,” he says.  Through partnerships with different hospitals, Smile Train supports patients seeking treatment for cleft lip and palate. While the definitive cause for cleft lip and palate remains largely unknown, Dr Osundwa offers that the formation is a mixture of genetic and environmental factors that sometimes involve the mother.  “One of the factors is deficiencies and this can be a lack of vitamins like B6, and B12, iron, and micronutrient deficiencies like zinc,” says the microfacial surgeon.

Ideally, the management of these cases, Dr Osundwa notes, should start during prenatal clinics, where an ultrasound can easily pick out children with clefts.

For now, Esther’s daughter is learning to talk through the help of a speech therapist and with the reassurances from doctors, soon she will lead a normal life.

Daasanach:The community where girls turn to pregnancy to escape period stigma,"The 14-year-old girl's slender frame seems overwhelmed by the growing life within her. Mina* is seven months pregnant, the result of a marriage to a 17-year-old boy last year. The baby she carries was conceived to conceal the shame Mina says she felt every month before her pregnancy.

As we enter her manyatta home in Illeret village, Marsabit County, Mina sways rhythmically, folding cowhides to wear when the sun sets. She sits on a woven mat, boiling beans over a crackling fire that fills the hut with smoky scents, while swirling a calabash of white liquid to make sour milk. In an instant, she transforms from a young girl into the ‘woman’ of the house.

After gaining consent from Mina and her mother, we interview her through a translator, as she only speaks the Daasanach vernacular. When we broach the topic of menstrual cycles, she recoils but agrees to proceed.

“I approached my now-husband. I chose to marry because I saw many of my peers getting married after the traditional ceremony among the Daasanach, where a goat is slaughtered when a girl gets her period. I was embarrassed when I first got my period, so immediately after our wedding, I got pregnant to stop my blood flow,"" Mina reveals.

Her revelation adds another layer to the reasons behind early child marriages – period shame – rarely explored compared to economic and cultural factors.

While the age gap between girls and their husbands is often wide, in most communities that practise child marriage, Mina’s husband, at 17, is still legally a child.

“The peer pressure of seeing my friends marry was too much. When I turned 13, I had to use bundled pieces of cloth during my menstrual cycle. Many peers told me pregnancy would stop my periods,"" Mina adds, drinking from the thickened sour milk in a calabash.

Famished, she drinks from the calabash, which swallows up her entire face, leaving only her dainty hands, the colourful beads adorned on her neck that drop down to her protruding belly, and her short, thick hair visible. When asked if discussing periods is embarrassing, Mina nods shyly.

“For the past seven months, I've been happy not to think about my periods or the cramps. NGOs bring menstrual hygiene products like sanitary towels, but I don't use them because I don't understand them, and it would be embarrassing to keep them in the house.""

Dr Diana Ondieki, a gynaecologist and lecturer at the University of Nairobi, remarks on the risks of teenage pregnancies.

Read also: The cultural bondages choking Kenyan women

“A teenage girl's body is still developing, and the pelvis is not fully developed. This means the baby must navigate a narrower passage during delivery, increasing complications for both mother and baby.

“The teenage girl may experience obstructed labour and may, therefore, need a caesarean section,” she says.

In another manyatta, we can hear a baby cooing. We walk in and find 15-year-old Sofi* cradling her eight-month-old baby, a child carrying a child. Her face does not convey the experiences she has gone through.

After consent from her mother, Sofi explains as she rocks her baby back and forth in her arms, ""I got my period at 11 and was extremely embarrassed. I didn't know what was happening or have any protection from the blood. A friend told me pregnancy would stop my period, so I was happy to get married and pregnant immediately.""

This is Sofi's second child; she had her first at 13. Both Sofi and Mina say they didn't know marrying before 18 was illegal, but wouldn't change their decision.

“In our culture, it's a big shame to get your period while under your mother's roof. Among my peers, it's said pregnancy stops your period for some time, stopping the shame,” Sofi says.

We ask Sofi if she ever wished to go to school.

“I might have gone to school if I hadn’t had children but because this is the path I chose, it is my responsibility to take care of my children, not look for an education,” she says.

Sofi's mother, Mama Sofi, was against her daughter's early marriage but can't advise her now that she's seen as a grown woman. She confirms that among the Daasanach, the topic of menstrual cycle has always been shrouded in embarrassment.

“If it were up to me, my daughters would have gone to school before marrying and having children, but they felt peer pressure. If they'd studied first, they might understand menstrual cycles better.”

Although she puts on a brave front, Sofi admits giving birth at her age was overwhelming.

""Giving birth comes with a lot of pain. It's a process I wouldn't wish upon anyone."" Dr Ondieki explains, “Sometimes, young girls experience spontaneous symphysiotomy – injury to the front of the pelvis that separates to allow the baby to pass through. If labour is prolonged, the baby may develop birth asphyxia. A pregnant teenager is also more likely to develop high blood pressure, anaemia, preterm births, and low-birth weight babies.”

Like Mina, Sofi has heard of menstrual hygiene products but prefers the traditional method of bundling pieces of cloth when menstruating. The young girls, like many of their peers as well as the women in their community, gave birth through the help of a traditional birth attendant (TBA) at their homesteads.

Both young mothers gave birth with the help of TBAs at their homesteads, a practice the government discouraged in 2013 because of high maternal mortality rates, especially among pastoralist communities like Marsabit, where more than 70 per cent of children were born at home. In that year, Kenya had the highest mortality rates in the world with 488 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.

“Delivery in health facilities is recommended to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, which is of even greater importance for teenage mothers since they are at a higher risk of developing complications that require interventions only possible in health facilities,” Dr Ondieki notes.

The good news is that this measure seems to have worked, with the 2022 Demographic and Health Survey showing a reduction in maternal deaths.

However, data shows North-eastern counties, including Marsabit, scored lower on women's ability to wash and change in privacy during menstruation.

Senator Gloria Orwoba, known for her advocacy in breaking period stigma, recalls distributing sanitary towels in Marsabit.

""For many women, it's taboo. It was the first time many discussed menstrual cycles. They said they wouldn't prioritise buying sanitary towels, not in the family budget. The moment girls hit puberty and start their periods, the priority is to pass that burden to another man (the husband).""

In another manyatta, 15-year-old Khadija, married to 19-year-old Irianyi Nyameto, says, “I got my period while living with my mother and felt embarrassed. Besides that, I got painful cramps. The only way to end the humiliation and pain was to get pregnant.”

Had Khadija known what she knows now, she wouldn't have got pregnant.

“I discovered I was anaemic after developing pregnancy complications and had an emergency birth. Giving birth was extremely painful.”

""Most pregnant teen girls don't access health facilities for antenatal care, missing opportunities for counselling on proper diet and supplements. If they're anaemic, they miss out on iron supplements, risking persistent headaches, fainting, and heart failure for the mother, and restricted growth for the baby,” Dr Ondieki explains.

Married life wasn't what Khadija expected. “I felt like my husband was always limiting my freedom and opinion. I was always afraid. It's only recently that he has relaxed from being so harsh.""

In Ileret, which currently lacks a ward administrator, the chief declines to comment on the matter, citing unauthorised media interaction. Mokoro Koriye, the former Illeret Ward administrator, however, acknowledges the issue.

“Many young girls get pregnant to hide menstrual shame, and families pressure them into marriage to avoid children out of wedlock. It’s deeply cultural, and the girls’ ages are decreasing,” he explains.

He links it to economic factors, saying, “Previously, residents had property and livestock. But with prolonged drought, they sought new income sources. Culturally, when a man gains community recognition, he desires multiple wives and children. The Daasanach community is socialised this way.”

Koriye highlights law enforcement challenges, adding, “Police face difficulties apprehending suspects due to a culture of silence within the community. They try their best alongside churches, chiefs, and NGOs, but it’s difficult.”

Anonymous police officers corroborated the challenges, stating the journey from Illeret to Marsabit court takes a day, and they lack resources to facilitate this arrests.

Gloria explains, “For many women in marginalised communities, the only way they know to take care of themselves is by saying, 'Let me become someone's wife.'

“They move from their father's house to the husband's home, believing that the man will take care of them. Furthermore, most of them understand that having a child will stop their menstrual cycle. There is limited knowledge about sexual and reproductive health in these communities. Again, due to deeply rooted cultural taboos, no one is willing to discuss these topics with the women.”

In the quest to find out more about period shaming in the community, we venture into an uncharted territory. Seeking the Daasanach men's perspective on menstrual taboos, our translator appears uncomfortable as she asks the questions on our behalf. We first speak to Khadija’s husband – 19-year-old Irianyi Nyameto.

“It's quite an embarrassing topic for everyone involved. Culture has taught our women to be secretive; they don't speak about it or any of its symptoms. Maybe because I'm younger, but I don't understand why that should be hidden from a husband. I was taught it is taboo to ask a woman how she's coping with her menses, so I don't ask.""

Nyameto explains that while married life has its challenges, he and his wife have eased into a more synergised routine. He hopes his child will have more education to understand bodily changes, as he can't discuss it.  “I hear NGOs bring sanitary towels and other menstrual hygiene items, yet many women are ashamed to use them because it's humiliating for a husband to find them in his house.”

As the sun sets, we meet 70-year-old Oganyin Nyamuta lying on a mat in the shadow of his manyatta. He explains the historical aspect of the menstrual taboo.

“It was indeed a sin for a girl to have her period under her mother's roof without first going through the traditional Daasanach ceremony. Any young girl who didn't go through this ceremony was considered an outcast and a custodian of sin. They would be marked as people who should not be married. There was also a belief that the mother and father in that family would die as a result,"" he says with a sharp look in his eyes and a deep voice, shaking with advanced age.

The old man’s sentiments add depth into the stigma that young girls face about their menstrual cycle, which has been embedded over generations.

Nyamuta believes the ceremony should continue despite the disintegration of cultural practices.

“A number of people in the community started shunning these practices, but I believe they should still go on to ensure parents live.”

Shem Nyakutu, the Secretary at the Directorate of Children’s Services, highlighted efforts to address menstrual health education and child marriages in the country.

“Many young girls decline to attend class due to shame associated with their menstrual cycles,” Nyakutu tells nation.africa.

“We’re partnering with Unicef to demystify this topic, teaching girls and boys that menstruation is normal and natural.”

Nyakutu emphasises the illegality of child marriages, saying, “It’s illegal to marry someone under 18; that’s the law. However, we find these harmful cultural practices occurring in different areas, which we aim to sensitise the public about, so they understand it’s a crime, not a civil issue.”

The Directorate plans a multi-agency approach involving chiefs, civil organisations, media, and others to help stop these practices. In 2019, the Ministry of Health developed the Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy, finding knowledge gaps about menstruation compounded by taboos, myths, and stigma.

We ask nominated Senator Orwoba whether the government is making strides in ensuring these are sealed and that young girls and women have access to menstrual products and proper hygiene.

“Kenya zero-rated all menstrual hygiene products until mid-last year. However, there were import taxes on some raw materials used in them, which we fought to remove. So, why are sanitary towels still expensive? At bulk, the product should be able to be shelved at Sh30. But the industry players have been able to silently control the market,"" she comments on government efforts.

On a separate visit to the Daasanach community, our attention is drawn to four bright-eyed and cheery girls, aged between 12 and 14.

Hanging from the cow shell belts around their waists are bunches of uncoordinated metal objects – padlocks, chains, and cow bells – jingling as they move. They are singing the traditional Daasanach song that marks the end of their girlhood and their advancement into womanhood after getting their first period.

As we watch them, we can't help but wonder if they, too, are having conversations similar to those of the young girls we spoke to a few days earlier, like Mina and Sofi, who got married and pregnant at an early age to avoid the shame and stigma associated with menstruation. We hope not.

Before bidding us goodbye, Mama Sofi, Sofi's mother, expresses her hope and prayer: “It is my wish that my grandchildren will break these harmful cultural practices. The solution to period stigma is not to marry and get pregnant at a young age but to accept menstruation as a normal process. Some of these cultural practices are there to hold young girls back, not push them forward.”

Her words resonate, highlighting the need for a shift in attitudes and traditions that have perpetuated the stigma surrounding menstruation, leading to detrimental consequences for young girls in the community.

800000 get 'Hustler' loans outside system,"The Hustler Fund issued Sh465 million loans to 809,351 Kenyans who had not registered for the product, exposing flaws in the operations of the micro-credit scheme targeted at low-income groups.

Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu has revealed that persons not listed with the fund got cash within the first seven months of its operation even as defaulters surged to cross Sh8.2 billion by the end of June last year.

""It was observed that 808,047 persons were issued with initial loan disbursement amounting to Sh464,700,721 before they opted into the financial service or product,” Ms Gathungu reveals in a report on operations of the Fund until June 2023.

“In the circumstances, it was not possible to confirm if the loan disbursements made to various customers complied with the regulations and whether the loans were accurate and free from manipulation,” Ms Gathungu adds in the report signed last month.

President William Ruto launched the Fund in March 2023 as part of his election manifesto to uplift low-income groups.

The fund issues loans of between Sh500 and Sh50,000 to individuals for a tenure of 14 days at an interest rate of eight percent per annum. For businesses, the fund disburses credit of between Sh10,000 and Sh200,000 with individual owners charged a seven percent annual interest rate.

The audit also queries the Fund Management’s flouting of the credit scoring model as a basis for determining creditworthiness, seeing it lend excessive loans to the tune of Sh220 million given to more than 5,000 people who were not eligible for this borrowing.

“However, examination of loan records reveals that the Fund disbursed loans which exceeded the set limits as follows; 238,707 persons were issued loans amounting to Sh420,312,323, which exceeded the initial loan limits by Sh219,615,242. Included in the loans were 5,070 persons not eligible for a loan,” the audit notes, faulting the configuration of the Hustler Fund system, to ensure that the disbursements do not exceed the limits.



It also notes that Safaricom overcharged borrowers who defaulted or delayed repayments Sh368 million, contravening the law which caps interest and administrative fees at eight percent or 9.5 percent if a borrower defaults.

This exposes the mobile network operator to legal suits that could see it fined up to Sh10 million for flouting Financial Inclusion Fund Regulations, 2022.

“The interest or administrative fee payable by a beneficiary on a financial service or product advanced under these Regulations shall be at a maximum rate of eight per centum per annum on reducing balance: Provided that where a beneficiary defaults, the interest or administrative fee payable shall be nine and one half per centum on a reducing balance,” the regulations state.

But the Auditor-General notes that despite the legal requirement, Safaricom charged borrowers penalties and rollover fees to the tune of 4.95 percent and 0.39 percent, respectively.

“However, it was noted that Safaricom charged a rollover fee at the rate of 0.195 to 0.392 percent and a penalty fee at the rate of 0.13 to 4.95 percent to beneficiaries amounting to Sh368,760,229 contrary to the provisions of the law and regulations,” Ms Gathungu notes.

The audit also queries failure by the Fund to provide proof of spending more than Sh450 million on goods and debt repayment, lending hundreds of millions of shillings to those who had not opted into the Fund, holding customers lacking identity cards, and extending more loans before repayment of initial packages.

The government set up the Hustler Fund in November 2022 and injected Sh12 billion in seed capital for lending to the target group. More than 17 million of the 21.28 million Kenyans who opted in applied for and got Sh32 billion loans by the end of June 2023.

But the Auditor notes that in the first seven months of the Fund's operations, its management was already flouting lending principles and could have sunk more than Sh8 billion in loans that had been defaulted upon.

“Out of the total loans disbursed, a balance of Sh10,950,075,614 had not been repaid as of June 30, 2023,” the Auditor-General notes, indicating that of the amount, Sh10.5 billion was unpaid principal loans.

Of the Sh10.5 billion loans, Sh8.2 billion had been defaulted on since borrowers had not made any payments for more than three months. “In the circumstances, the recoverability of outstanding loans totalling Sh8,219,087,056 could result in loss of public funds,” Ms Gathungu noted.

But leading to the defaults was a cocktail of failures by the Hustler Fund management, including holding customers who had no national identity card, the key identifier for all beneficiaries, issuing Sh161.9 million loans to some 114,213 Kenyans before repayment of previous loans and closing 129,315 loan accounts with Sh81.6 million that had not been repaid.

“However, their loan repayments could not be traced.

“No proper explanation was provided by Management to explain why the loan accounts were closed before the repayment of the loans,” the audit reveals.

The audit also reveals that some 2,701 loan accounts amounting to Sh2 million could not be traced despite being issued.

“Data analysis for loan disbursements at KCB revealed that customer loans were uniquely identified through a Loan Identity Number. However, it was identified that there are Loan Identity Numbers that were used to process more than one loan whereby 867 loan IDs were used to process 1,978 loans amounting to Sh477,928. This is an indication that the loan management system is not properly configured,” the audit adds.

Ms Gathungu scored the Fund 'a disclaimer of opinion', meaning its financial statements showed “serious and significant misstatements,” arising from inadequate information, limitation of scope, inadequacy, or lack of proper records “such that I was not able to form an opinion on the financial operations.”

She noted that after the Fund released its financial statements for audit on September 29, 2023, it later submitted amended financial statements on May 3, 2024, just a day before she signed the report.

“However, the source documents to support the financial statement balances such as cashbooks and general ledger were not provided for audit review. It was, therefore, not possible to confirm the source and authenticity of the balances in respect of the components reflected in the Trial Balance and the financial statements,” Ms Gathungu states, while also noting that the statements had glaring inconsistencies, including pagination.

Fady Rostom: Clothing brand owner who owns and wears only one T-shirt,"Fady Rostom won’t reveal himself easily. He hides behind a curtain of withering self-deprecation and truly atrocious dad jokes. His tongue remains in cheek, wearing his witticism on his sleeves. He won’t let you in until he is sure you understand what being in entails.

Inside his world is a world of art where the analytical left brain and the creative right brain are combined to build powerful brands. Twenty years ago, he and his partners co-founded ARK Africa, a design, strategy, and innovation company.

Around the same time, he started Bonk, an apparel, accessories, and stationery brand that you might know for its quality t-shirts. It started on the back of youth and rebellion, to show big brands that young local entrepreneurs can also make great quality products. “And anyway,” he adds, “every designer, at some point in their lives, seeks to make a t-shirt.”

The brand has endured, or as Faddy puts it modestly, it “washes its own face.”

He’s a juggler of rubber and porcelain balls. Some fall. Some can’t be allowed to fall. “The rest can fall and bounce back,” he says. “But the fatherhood ball can’t fall.”

When did you realise you had this great blessing to create, that you were doing things differently with your imagination?

I always liked art as a child. My mom was an architect even though she didn’t practise architecture. But you could always see how she employed design and art around the house. She had the art for it. It was always very methodical.

She’s an inventor and she was always solving domestic problems by drawing the solutions first: how do you solve the problem of a banging door by using design? How can a cheese strainer be improved to be more efficient? Little hacks like that. I watched her doing all this and was influenced by the ingenuity of it all. I was mostly attracted to architecture even though I eventually studied civil engineering at the University of Nairobi.

And your dad?

My mzee was a professor in engineering, so he is super analytical. Engineering is very systematic in terms of how you solve problems. To be creative you have to be curious, and see normal things differently. You have to almost be okay with geeking out and following your intuition, questioning things, and being observant because those are the ingredients for creativity.

Were you an odd child?

Nothing has changed. [Chuckle] I don't think I was noticeably odd. We - my older brother and I - didn’t grow up in a household you'd imagine we did; creative and full of artistic expressions. Our home was very quiet and very strict. With mzee being an academician, academics, order, and discipline took precedence. Our time was structured and accounted for to the last minute; time to study for 55 minutes and then a five-minute break. This task is for an hour, 30 minutes break. It was military. We only realised there was a flaw in this system when mzee told us that God gave us holidays so we could study. [Chuckles] That’s when we said, ' Wait a minute, that doesn’t sound right'. [Laughter] But yes, we studied hard and art was just the most fun subject for me. When I was 17, my dad loaned me money to go to New York for three months. There I lived in hostels, did odd jobs, and made enough money to come back with a bicycle, a computer that I would use to start design, and enough money to pay him back. Thankfully he refunded me half the money. That trip taught me independence and how to create my path.

You are Egyptian by descent, how did your parents end up here?

I think by plane. [Grin] Anyway, so Dad came to set up the surveying and photogrammetry department at the University of Nairobi in the early 70s. It was a short two-year contract and he ended up renewing it 20 times. At some point, he went back to meet my mom and bring her back, probably in the same aircraft.

Are you curious about Egypt?

You know, they call us the Third Culture kids because even though you identify the place you have grown up as home, you still stand out as being from somewhere else. When I go to Egypt I can relate with a few things but I always feel more like a foreigner there despite being able to blend in. I have relatives back there.

What do you think is very Egyptian about you?

I like bread. Bread is a staple in Egypt. I love bread. Carbs are fun, they are delicious. So, the word for bread in Egyptian is aish baladi, which coincidentally or not, is also the meaning for “life.” So yes, bread is serious stuff.

What is the one thing you are really good at…apart from your unique dad jokes, of course.

I enjoy figuring stuff out. I like understanding the root causes of things and making sense of complexities. This is what we have found ourselves doing for the better part of the last two decades at Ark Africa; taking in a lot of information or challenges, finding the patterns and creating clarity. You could say my strength is strategy. And strategy is either problem-driven or inventive, a gut feeling, an impulse. Imagine the people at Apple who said, ‘Typing on these Blackberrys is problematic, let’s have a touch screen.’ Someone must have said, 'Touchscreen? Never going to work.' Now imagine another room where someone asked, ' How can we have a faster horse?' And someone - Henry Ford - must have said, ' Why a horse, can’t we build a car?' Someone in the room: 'A what?' So, one of these examples is solving a problem and the other is inventive.

Did naming this company ARK have anything to do with Noah from the Old Testament?

Despite our youthful looks, we wear old hats because we started this company 19 years ago. In 2006 I was building websites and software for the Radio Africa Group where I met Mwangi Kirubi, one of my co-founders. We got wind that Equity Bank had just changed from a building society to a bank and wanted to grow into other regions in Kenya. They were not seen as a posh bank and so the fancy agencies weren’t too keen to work with them.

They wanted a campaign, a documentary. We teamed up with another guy called Angelo Kinyua (no longer with the company) and did the job. Our company name came from our names, Angelo, Rostom, Kirubi. We started doing advertising for two years before we moved on to this deeper world of design and strategy. We now sit in a unique space, bang in the middle of management consulting and ad agencies. This space is called strategy and innovation.

Why did you start Bonk?

I needed a hobby. The hobby became a business. It was also founded on the premise of youth, a rebellious product to show the big brands that I didn’t have to have big muscles to make high-quality merchandise. Also, every designer at some point in their lives wants to make a t-shirt. It's done well, surprisingly. It’s still here, and it washes its own face. It keeps us in touch with pop culture, what’s cool. It also helps us experiment with product design.

Each time I have met you, you have been in a blue T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. It’s either that’s all you wear or you own just that one T-shirt and those jeans.

[Laughs] I don’t have any other clothes, Biko, it's just these. So, my son's classmate who's six years old also noticed the same thing. He was like, ‘Why are you always in that t-shirt?' [Chuckles] The beauty of wearing the same colours every day is that my mornings are not marked by me asking myself that one question; what should I wear? As my wife says, I'm the most complicated, simple man she knows. The downside is that nosy journalists always ask if I have other clothes.

How has fatherhood shifted your life?

Its greatest effect has been on my girth and hairline. Our son is six, our daughter is three and a half. Fatherhood is delightful, fantastic, and exhausting. These little humans who are full of energy and mischief and who you would do anything for. You see them grow and you see yourselves in them. It's very fulfilling. They have taught me patience and moderation. I spent a lot of time cycling before my children came but once we got our first born, I stopped.

From the start, we made a very intentional decision to be present for our children; so no live-in nanny. We wash and cook for them. Yes, we love hardship, it's a small price to pay for the reward, which is being present to watch them grow. When they grow up I will get back on the bike. I see life as juggling many balls, some that can fall and bounce back others that can’t. Raising children is a ball you don’t want falling because they won’t bounce back. Everything else can.

Did you have to get on an aircraft to Egypt to get a wife like your mzee?

[Laughs] No, she's from here.

What is your most noticeable eccentrism?

I might have OCD [obsessive-compulsive disorder] only that I prefer to call it OCE: the E is enjoyment. I like precision. If something is marginally off at work, or anywhere, I will notice it and I enjoy correcting it.

I like improving things and it’s not limited to the aesthetic or the optical alignment, I mean everything! As a society, we have fallen into this trap of celebrating mediocrity. We get potholes, someone comes with stones and crashes them in there, and the road is fixed. We are happy. That road won't last two weeks. We have to be tough on ourselves and be more demanding. Comfort zones are dangerous.

Our society can’t evolve when we refuse to want better for ourselves. Take something as how we behave in public queues, skipping a queue reflects how we deal with and think of each other. Overlapping on roads at the expense of other patient road users is a sign of a lack of integrity. And if you are that kind of person who lacks integrity on the roads there is little chance you will be a different person at work or home.

What are you currently improving in your life at 42?

Sleep. We're just out of the phase where the children wake up a few times a night. So sleep is gold. I got a new pillow, that’s how serious this is, Biko. I’m also trying to get a new balance at work. We are almost 20 years old, we do both the structured analytical side but we also have the creative side and so we're finding good harmony in what we call creative strategy. I'm also trying to improve my role here, which is working less in the business and more on the business.

What‘s the one thing you'd change in life now?

Seeing how you reacted to my wardrobe? Maybe have some more colour in my wardrobe.

New taxes to make banking services unaffordable to most Kenyans,"Banks have warned of higher cost of transacting if Parliament approves the proposed value-added tax (VAT) and higher excise on financial services, arguing there is a risk of rolling back gains in financial inclusion and eradicating money laundering.

The Kenya Bankers Association (KBA), in its submissions to the National Assembly’s Finance and National Planning Committee on the Finance Bill 2024, says the country also risks losing competitiveness as a result of taxing cross-border money transfers.

In the Bill, which is on public review, the Treasury has proposed to introduce VAT on financial services such as telegraphic money transfers, issuance of credit and debit cards, foreign exchange transactions, cheque processing and issuance of securities for money, including bills of exchange and promissory notes.

It is also proposing to increase the excise duty on money transfer fees by banks, money transfer agencies and other financial service providers to 20 percent from 15 percent.

Banks say the proposed changes will put formal money transfers beyond the reach of the low-income earner and the small and medium enterprises, thus pushing them to unregulated channels that carry the risk of fraud.

“As such, this might result in individuals turning to informal or unregulated channels to send and receive money. These channels often lack transparency and security, increasing the risk of fraud, money laundering, and loss of revenue for the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA),” said the KBA in its submissions to the committee.

“Additionally, the introduction of VAT on these financial services goes against the international best practices around the globe where financial services are exempt from VAT. It also goes against the basic principle of VAT as VAT is applicable on supply of goods and services, which does not include supply of money.”



The Finance Bill has also proposed a VAT on insurance and reinsurance services, a clause that the banks want removed, saying this will further constrict insurance penetration and make local underwriters lose competitiveness.

Kenya’s insurance penetration remains low at less than two percent. The sector’s growth dropped by 1.7 percent last year, a development that the KBA attributes to the complexities tied to the introduction of VAT on compensation for loss of the taxable supplies and the requirement for insurers to onboard an electronic tax invoice management system.

The KBA has faulted the proposed motor vehicle circulation tax that will be levied at 2.5 percent of the value of the asset, terming it discriminatory due to a cap of Sh100,000 that favours those with vehicles valued at more than Sh4 million.

The KBA added that the tax will discourage the uptake of motor vehicle loans on account of higher operating costs that will make it difficult to service such loans.

On the proposal to introduce a withholding tax on green and infrastructure bonds, the bankers said the economy risks losing out on investments and potential inflows into these products.

These bonds are now exempted from tax, making them attractive, but the Bill is proposing a five percent withholding tax on the interest earned on the bonds for local investors, and 15 percent for non-resident investors.

The Bill proposes that a taxpayer challenging a tax demand will have seven days to produce the information the taxman is asking for or the objection shall be disallowed.

Banks want this period raised to 30 days from the day of notice, saying they handle a lot of information due to the big size of their customer base, meaning they need more time to retrieve data.

The lenders also oppose the extension of time required for the KRA to issue an objection decision upon receiving a valid notice of objection from 60 to 90 days.

According to the KBA, delaying the decisions impacts underlying business profits given that banks must take provisions of anticipated cash outflow and ensure the business is prepared for the assessment.

Kenya to use World Bank loan to clear Sh65bn Eurobond,"Kenya will use part of the Sh156.8 billion loan it recently secured from the World Bank to clear the outstanding balance of Sh65.3 billion ($500 million) from its debut Eurobond which matures on June 24.

The final payment on the 2014 sovereign bond is expected to put to rest investor jitters that had deflated foreign exchange flows in the past year and triggered a sharp depreciation in the value of the Kenyan shilling.

Last week, the World Bank executive board approved the disbursement of Sh156.8 billion ($1.2 billion) to Kenya with the proceeds being expected to be deployed partly in easing the current government funding constraints.

“Part of the disbursement will be used to settle the $500 million of the remaining Eurobond,” Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) governor Kamau Thugge told a media briefing on Thursday.

The government has taken a multi-pronged strategy to settle the Sh261.4 billion ($2 billion) Eurobond, whose principal was scheduled as a one-off payment at the end of the paper’s tenure on June 24.

In February, the CBK and the National Treasury oversaw the successful buyback of notes worth Sh196 billion ($1.5 billion) through the issuance of a new amortised Eurobond of the same value.

An amortised bond is a type where each payment goes towards both interest and principal. In the early stages of the loan, much of each payment will go towards interest, and in the late stages, a greater percentage goes towards the principal.

A buyback describes the process through which an issuer repurchases its own bonds from investors before the scheduled maturity date.

The February buyback was critical in offsetting fears of a potential sovereign default among Kenya’s creditors.

The Treasury had expected to clear the remaining portion of the Eurobond from a mix of government funds and financing from multilateral and bilateral sources, including syndicated bank loans.



In February, the exchequer noted it was pursuing a diversified strategy in retiring the Eurobond to drive down future interest expenses.

“This diversified financing approach aims to maintain a relatively low weighted average interest rate in the overall public debt portfolio, ensuring Kenya’s debt sustainability over the medium term,” Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u noted.

Besides clearing the 2024 Eurobond, the new World Bank financing is expected to boost the availability of foreign exchange in the country, anchoring further stability in the exchange rate.

The Kenya shilling has rallied since the February buyback, becoming among the world’s best-performing currencies this year with a year-to-date return of Sh16.7 percent, having traded at Sh130.71 against the US dollar as of Wednesday.

“The inflows and outflows of foreign exchange through the balance of payments will ultimately determine the level of the exchange rate,” Dr Thugge added.

The government is seemingly in a race to prevent the buildup of future jitters around the repayment of other outstanding Eurobonds and has targeted a second buyback of the notes this year, setting a target of Sh130.7 billion ($1 billion).

Added to the February buyback, the government is expected to have repurchased notes worth Sh326.7 billion ($2.5 billion) by the end of 2024.

The buyback is likely to target the redemption of the Sh130.7 billion ($1 billion) which matures in February 2028 and features a one-off principal payment.

The government has moved to break up refinancing pressures on the Eurobonds with its most recent issuance featuring a three-equal part redemption of the paper which matures in February 2031.

Kenya will, however contend with relatively higher interest rates in the international capital markets should it opt to issue new Eurobonds as a means of partly offsetting outstanding notes.

The new Eurobond, for instance, has a higher 9.75 percent coupon against a coupon of 6.875 percent on the sovereign bond issued in 2014.

The country’s total outstanding Eurobonds are valued at Sh928 billion ($7.1 billion) and have maturities stretching out to February of 2048.

Taxpayers fork out Sh17bn in nine months to service KQ loan,"Taxpayers forked out Sh17.4 billion in the nine months to March 2024 to service a Kenya Airways loan that the government has now taken over, disclosures by the National Treasury show.

The $641.49 million (Sh83.4 billion) KQ loan was a 12-year facility originally provided by US lenders Citi Bank and JP Morgan in 2017 before it was taken over by US export financier Private Export Funding Corporation (Pefco) with the US Exim Bank and the Kenyan government joining as guarantors.

Kenya Airways took up the loan to finance the purchase of seven aircraft and an engine but failed to fully service the debt due to cash flow challenges linked to Covid-19 disruptions.

Interest and principal payments

The Treasury’s guarantee covered $525 million (Sh68.3 million), which is now being serviced fully until maturity by the taxpayer after the government converted the guarantee to external commercial public debt.

“Supplementary Budget II estimates indicate that in 2023/24, the payment of Kenya Airways PLC guaranteed debt was converted to mainstream external public debt stock and a subsequent entry of a new external commercial loan owed to Exim Bank USA/PEFCO was captured,” said the National Assembly’s Privatisation and Public Debt Committee in a report on Supplementary Budget II 2023/24 and 2024/25 Budget Estimates.

“Interest and principal payments for this new loan amounted to Sh14.3 billion and Sh20.9 billion in 2023/24 and 2024/25, respectively, with further Sh21.3 billion and Sh10.7 billion in 2025/26 and 2026/27, respectively,” adds the report.

Earlier disclosures by the National Treasury indicated that there was also an interest payment of Sh3.1 billion on the loan.

Taxpayer risks losing out

Even before the conversion of the guarantee into public debt, the government had since last year been servicing the debt on behalf of the national carrier after it defaulted on its obligations to the US Exim Bank.

Treasury had previously indicated that the loan repayments done by the government on behalf of KQ will be recovered through a subsidiary loan agreement between the State and the airline as per the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012.

The Public Debt and Privatisation Committee of the National Assembly has, however, raised the red flag that the taxpayer risks losing out on the repayments following the conversion of the guarantee to mainstream debt, which would be contrary to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act.

The removal of the debt from the books of Kenya Airways is positive for the restructuring efforts, making it easier for the airline to attract a strategic investor.

X adult content policy risks collision with authorities,"Elon Musk-owned social media giant X has updated its policy to allow the sharing and distribution of adult content in a popularity strategy that could put it on a collision course with governments, including Kenya.

In the update, X says users would be allowed to share consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behaviour, so long as it is properly labelled and not prominently displayed in highly visible places like profile photos and banners.

“We believe users should be able to create, distribute and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression,” reads the text.

“We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their beliefs, desires and experiences.”

Read: Explainer - Why the US government is trying to ban TikTok

X defines adult content as consensually produced and distributed material that depicts adult nudity or sexual behaviour that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal, including AI-generated, photographic or animated content.

“Users under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile cannot click to view marked content,” X says.

The policy could open a battle with Kenyan authorities who are on an aggressive drive to weed out “immorality” on social media platforms.

According to media analyst Egline Samoei, the decision by X is part of a wider scheme geared towards the ultimate introduction of a paywall.

She is, however, is quick to point out that the move could fail, especially in conservative markets like Kenya.

“The policy update is a marketing strategy by X and Mr Musk to tap into generators of adult content banned from other platforms. The goal could be to put content in a paywall and monetise,” she says.

“But the policy portends risks to users and brands that value online safety. This could spark negative reactions among users and regulators.”

A nationwide debate regarding a possible ban on use of the popular short-form video-sharing app TikTok has dominated policy and expert conversations over the display of sexually explicit content among other concerns, prompting the platform’s global CEO Shou Zi Chew to seek virtual audience with President William Ruto.

Shortly after August 2023 meeting, a State House dispatch indicated that Mr Chew had agreed to work with Kenya in reviewing and monitoring TikTok content as concerns heated up against runaway moral breakdown among the users, who are mostly young.

Weeks before the meeting, a Kenyan named Bob Ndolo had petitioned the National Assembly and Senate, to effect a ban on TikTok, arguing that the explicit content on the platform promoted sexual violence, hate speech and vulgarity, thereby undermining the country’s morals.

"Soft drink makers warn of job sheds, costlier plastics","Soft drinks makers have urged Parliament to block a proposal in the Finance Bill 2024 to impose a 10 percent tax on locally manufactured plastics, warning that it would trigger rises in the cost of business, packaged products as well as job sheds.

Coca-Cola told the National Assembly’s Committee on Finance and National Planning that the proposed change to the Excise Duty Act will subject locally made plastics to the tax.

The Treasury, through the Finance Bill, 2024 is seeking to delete the word “imported” in clause 42 (G) of the Excise Duty Act.

The Act currently imposes a 10 percent excise duty on only imported articles of plastics under the tariff headings 3923.30.00 and 3923.90.90.

The soft drinks manufacturer wants MPs to reverse the proposed deletion of the word “imported” as proposed in the Finance Bill, 2024.

John Mwendwa, Coca-Cola Director for Public Affairs, Communications & Sustainability said the introduction of the excise duty on imported plastics was meant to protect the local industry.

He said there is a large and vibrant plastics manufacturing industry in Kenya that makes products for use by consumers and for use by other manufacturers to package their products.

“By imposing excise duty on locally produced plastics, this will increase the cost of production and thus increase the cost of goods that require the use of plastic packaging,” Mr Mwendwa said.

“Coupled with other proposed levies on plastic packaging, this will result in multiple taxation on the same product, further increasing the costs of businesses and consumers.”

Committee chairperson Kuria Kimani concurred with Coca-Cola that deleting the word “imported” in Section 4G of the Excise Duty Act will essentially mean levying a 10 percent excise levy on all plastics.

Separately, the Packaging Producer Responsibility Organisation “PAKPRO”, a business member organisation representing manufacturers, brand owners, retailers, and importers of raw materials for the manufacture of packaging materials, called for a total deletion of the eco levy.

“Materials used for packing should be exempted from tax. We are levying manufacturers up to Sh17 per kilo. Imposing an eco levy at Sh150 per kilo will amount to double taxation. This means the cost of goods will go up and costs passed to consumers,” Mr Kimani Rugendo, who chairs PAKPRO said.

MPs caution Treasury over unrealistic revenue targets,"Parliament has accused the National Treasury of setting an unrealistic revenue target in the budget, forcing the State to borrow more or cut back on development spending to cover tax collection shortfalls.

The Budget and Appropriations Committee of the National Assembly, in its report on the 2023/2024 Supplementary Budget II, said that by the end of April, the Treasury had a revenue shortfall of Sh222.2 billion against its 10-month target of Sh2.4 trillion.

As a result, the country’s budget deficit for the current fiscal year as per the Supplementary II Budget has risen to Sh908.6 billion, from the Sh718.9 billion in the original budget estimates published in June 2023.

In the June budget estimates, the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP stood at 4.7 percent, but this has now risen to 5.9 percent, putting the country at risk of breaching some of the loan covenants with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that call for a steady reduction of this deficit.

“The committee observed that the National Treasury continues to overestimate revenue, resulting in recurring deficits and necessitating increased borrowing to cover shortfalls. The shortfall in revenue in the fiscal year 2023/2024 is substantial, as indicated by the revised revenue targets by the National Treasury, which have been lowered by Sh250 billion,” said the committee in the report.

To finance the budget shortfall, the Treasury has targeted net borrowing worth Sh589.3 billion from the domestic market and Sh319.3 billion in foreign net financing.

The borrowing targets tend to be reviewed over a fiscal year, depending on the revenue performance and financing conditions, especially in the external market.

At the beginning of the year, the Treasury was targeting Sh587.4 billion from the domestic market, and Sh131.5 billion externally. This was revised to Sh474.5 billion and Sh412.1 billion respectively in the Supplementary I Budget of November 2023 (where the total deficit rose to Sh886.6 billion).

Treasury allocates Sh901 million to SGR ticket and security systems,"The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) will get Sh901 million from the exchequer in the new financial year starting July 1, to fund the completion of its passenger ticketing system and an integrated security system.

“The operations and maintenance of the standard gauge railway has been allocated Sh901 million from the Railway Development Fund for an integrated security management system and completion of the passenger ticketing system,” the Budget Committee of the National Assembly disclosed in a report. It did not give details of the ticketing and security system projects. The management of Kenya Railways Corporation—the agency under which SGR falls—had not responded to questions over the matter by the time of going to press.

“This (allocation) implies that the standard gauge railway is supported by the taxpayer, which is an indication that the project is struggling to break even six years after the operationalisation of the passenger and freight services,” the budget committee added.

The SGR train service, popular as Madaraka Express is yet to break even seven years since it started operations, leaving the train to heavily rely on the exchequer to fund daily operations and to pay the Chinese loan that was tapped to fund the project.



Kenya tapped a $3.75 billion (Sh489.71 billion at current exchange rates) from the Chinese lender to fund the construction of the railway from Mombasa to Nairobi and later to Naivasha.

Besides paying the loan, taxpayers have also been footing the operational costs of the Madaraka Express as the train struggles to break even.

Operating costs of the SGR are not readily available, although past documents tabled in Parliament showed it cost about Sh18 billion to operate the passenger and cargo trains, with fuel taking a huge chunk of the money.

The SGR made a total of Sh79.72 billion between 2017 and the end of last year, with revenues from the freight trains accounting for 84 percent of this or Sh67.09 billion.

However, the train has been unable to self-fund operations and is also yet to start paying the loan that the Treasury procured from the Exim Bank of China.

"Ketraco MD, John Mativo, on inheriting Kenya Power assets and the State agency's expanded mandate","The stability of power supply has become a major talking point, especially over the past year as Kenya struggled with multiple nationwide blackouts, some of which were triggered by constraints in power transmission infrastructure.

The Business Daily talked with John Mativo, the managing director of the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco). Dr Mativo has now served for 13 months at the helm of the power transmission company.

The civil engineer who rose through the ranks after joining the State company in 2010, outlined the firm’s pipeline of projects that will help stabilise power supply, his vision and Ketraco’s expanded mandate.

Ketraco relies on funding from the Treasury to undertake its operations. What is your plan to enable Ketraco to achieve financial autonomy?

We want to do what we call asset monetisation and recycling that will open up areas of using our assets to attract funding that we can inject into our projects. We also have the bulk supply regulations (the draft Energy (Electricity Market, Bulk Supply, and Open Access) Regulations 2024) that will open up wheeling revenue. This means that every large power consumer can buy outside the power purchase agreement (PPA) and they only have to pay Ketraco a wheeling tariff.

What lessons is Ketraco taking from the major transmission companies in the world that are financially independent?

A good case study is the Power Grid Corporation of India. About 30 years ago the company was reliant on money from the exchequer. Today, Power Grid Corporation is the eleventh most profitable company in India, it is more profitable than generation, distribution and even retail. They achieved that by making some good strategic decisions and investments and that is my desired benchmark for Ketraco.

How are you planning to fast-track the implementation of key power transmission projects using new financing models such as public-private partnerships (PPPs)?

We are working with the private sector through public-private partnerships (PPPs). We have two sets of PPP projects that are advanced. The PPP lines that will come on board are the Loosuk-Lessos line to allow part of the power from a wind plant near Maralal to go to western Kenya. Then we plan to do a line from Kibos in Kisumu to Kakamega. The two projects are at the project development stage. We are currently moving to the negotiation phase before we go to approval.

In December 2021, Ketraco was designated as the system operator to control the power mix of the grid, taking over the role from Kenya Power. How is Ketraco preparing to undertake this role?

We are building a new modern National System Control Centre (NSCC) in Embakasi. The project will cost €85 million (Sh12.26 billion). The national control centre will help us in the sense that all these projects that we are doing have to be seen and controlled. Secondly, the more we increase wind and solar, you require modern facilities to bring more and more renewable energy that is variable into the network. We will also be building a backup national control centre at a secret location.

Ketraco is set to play an important role in linking the regional power grids under the Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP). What is the status of the key transmission projects that will link Kenya to Tanzania and Uganda?

We are targeting to commission the Kenya-Tanzania interconnector by the end of June. The line is physically completed but there is some equipment that we need to put in place. The commission tests might take more than a month to ensure there is harmony between the two grids. On the Kenya-Uganda line, we had a challenge with the contractor, we are trying to sort it out so that we can complete the line. But there is an existing line connecting the two countries; the new line is to offer more opportunities.

Kenya Power is valuing its transmission assets ahead of the transfer of some to Ketraco. How is Ketraco building its institutional and human capacity to handle an expanded network?

We will need to beef up our staffing capacity. In terms of technical capacity, we will be able to absorb the relevant Kenya Power staff. We will be able to identify the staff handling transmission and the relevant equipment for the transfer. However, this is not the first time that mandates are shifting (between separate government ministries and parastatals), so the process will be done in an orderly manner.

Kenya’s transmission capacity is constrained. How soon will Ketraco complete some of the major transmission lines to stabilise the power supply?

When we came on board (in 2008), we had a very simple grid as Kenya had done approximately 3,400 kilometres of transmission lines, which was the line from Mombasa to Malaba. We are completing 15 projects in 2024. We are completing the Isinya-Konza line which will connect Konza to the grid. By the end of June, Turkwel will have two ways to evacuate power; either through the Turkwel-Lessos line or the Ortum-Kitale line. There are other projects that we plan to start this year, including the Narok-Bomet line that will allow power to flower from Olkaria to Bomet, Sotik and Kisii. We also now have a contractor doing the Sondu-Ndhiwa line and we are pushing to see if they can finish within this calendar year.

How proposed taxes will affect the telco industry,"Telkom Kenya has urged Parliament to block the increase of excise duty on internet data charges, mobile financial services, and imported SIM cards arguing it will negatively impact the digitisation of the economy.

The telco told the National Assembly’s Finance and National Planning committee that the proposals in the Finance Bill, 2024 will have knockoff effects on the telecommunication sector and the economy.

The Treasury is proposing to amend the Excise Duty Act to increase excise duty on voice and internet data charges from 15 percent to 20 percent.

The Bill also seeks to increase excise duty on fees charged for mobile financial services from 15 to 20 percent. It further seeks to amend the Miscellaneous Fees and Levies Act to introduce an eco-levy at the rate of Sh150 per kilogramme on all articles of plastic packaging materials.

“The increase from 15 percent to 20 percent just one year after the reduction goes against the government agenda of inclusion and digitisation through the provision of affordable mobile connectivity and data services,” said Mr Mugo Kibati, the chief executive of Telkom Kenya.

Read: KRA to monitor telcos' daily sales in tax evasion fight

“This tax negatively affects cash flows and revenues of mobile operators, therefore, discouraging rollout and denying consumers price discounts and high quality that come with greater investment into the sector.”

Mr Allan Wainaina, the chief finance officer who represented Mr Kibati told MPs that the increment of the prevailing excise tax comes with greater investment into the sector.

Telkom Kenya Limited asked the committee chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani to maintain the excise duty at the current level of 15 percent with a plan to reduce it over time to zero or near zero.

Mr Wainaina asked MPs to repeal the existing Sh50 excise tax imposed on imported mobile phone SIM cards.

“It is our submission that the existing Sh50 excise tax imposed on imported mobile phones SIM cards should be removed to encourage uptake of telecommunications services,” said Mr Wainaina.

“The 10 percent excise tax on imported mobile devices should be gradually phased out.”

Telkom Kenya said the proposed increase of import declaration fee (IDF) from 2.5 percent to three percent will result in increased SIM cards and capital expenditure costs.

The telco argued the IDF increase will add on to consumer costs for subscription to mobile services, and acquisition of mobile devices.

“The increased costs of network infrastructure will also negatively affect both consumers and investors thereby compromising the government agenda for digitisation of government services and increased uptake of ICT services for both economic and social development for the population.

Mr Kimani said the committee is of the view that the country should continue making progress in the telecommunications sector.

“We reduced excise duty rates for mobile phones and manufacturers have been able to assemble cheap phones retailing at Sh9,000 and they cannot satisfy the local market,” Mr Kimani said.

State allocates Sh612m to connect Marsabit to national power grid,"The government has allocated Sh612.7 million to build a power line to connect Marsabit, Kenya’s second-largest county, to the national grid for the first time.

The proposed allocation by the National Treasury is for the financial year 2024/25, which begins in July, with the allocation set to be raised further to Sh3.97 billion in the financial year 2025/26.

The county is home to the 310 megawatt (MW) Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) wind farm, which is the country’s single largest power station but is still served by off-grid fuel-powered stations.

Marsabit had a population of 459,785 in 2019, according to the latest national census conducted by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).

The Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco) has commenced environmental assessment studies for the 400kW Loiyangalani – Marsabit transmission line.

The 162-kilometre line will evacuate power from the wind farm, which is located at Loyiangalani to Marsabit town, which is the county’s economic hub.

“The line will be a game changer for Marsabit residents because they will be connected to the grid for the first time,” said Ketraco managing director John Mativo in an interview.

“This will also lower power costs for consumers in the long-term because the fuel, which is used to run the thermal power station in Marsabit and other places in the country, forms part of electricity bills,” said Dr Mativo.

Customers are charged a fuel energy charge on their monthly power bills, which goes towards the running of fuel-powered plants, some of which supply electricity to off-grid areas.



The government has also set aside a further Sh612.7 million for the construction of the 220kV line that will run from Marsabit to Isiolo over a distance of 253 kilometres. According to the budget estimates, the line will receive a further Sh1.5 billion in the fiscal year 2025/26.

The two projects will also see the construction of transmission substations at Marsabit and Isiolo.

Dr Mativo added that the two lines pass through vast swathes of land that have a huge capacity for solar and wind power generation and open up opportunities for power plants to set up in the region and connect to the grid.

Nairobi up 24 places on startup-friendly city log,"Kenya’s capital Nairobi has improved as one of the most preferred cities for startup investments, climbing 24 places to position 113 globally, up from 137th last year.

According to the latest Global Startup Ecosystem Index report published by sector research centre StartupBlink, Nairobi also rose one spot among African peers to rank third after it pipped South Africa’s Cape Town.

The latest ranking points to a sustained perfection by Nairobi from the 163rd place it occupied in the 2022 grading.

In yet another win for Kenya, Kisumu made it to the global top 1,000 list for the first time, holding the 985th position while on the downside, Mombasa slipped from the coveted group continuing on its last year's course where it dropped 46 slots to rank at position 937.

Among factors that have been attributed to Nairobi’s consistency in maintaining startup attractiveness include active public sector involvement that has seen the establishment of tech hubs such as the Konza Technopolis as well as the promise to enact the Startup Act, which is a framework that encourages a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.

“Besides public sector efforts, Nairobi is home to regional offices of global tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel, which makes the city attractive to tech startups. Also, the presence of accelerators like Antler and Pangea Accelerator contributes to the startup culture,” said the report.

“The Association of Startup and SMEs Enablers of Kenya (ASSEK) actively fosters relationships between stakeholders within the ecosystem.”

Mobile payments solution M-Pesa has also played a prominent role in cementing the city’s status as an innovative tech hub with the report noting that its takeoff was impressive considering Kenya’s relatively low population compared to larger African economies.

Nairobi’s improvement comes at a time when local news headlines are awash with reports of entrepreneurial struggles as startups fold down while others scale back operations on what they have primarily termed as a prolonged funding drought.

E-commerce firm Copia is the latest to join the ranks of struggling startups in Kenya. Copia was on May 23, 2024 placed under administration barely weeks after it issued a redundancy notice of sending home 1,060 workers, woes it blamed on liquidity constraints.

An analysis by Business Daily shows that at least eight Kenyan tech startups have closed shop in the past two-and-a-half years despite absorbing a combined total of Sh11.2 billion while scores more are exhibiting distress signs.

Although most of the startups blame their troubles on the funding drought, available data and interviews with founders suggest other factors, including the viability of their business models and most recently, unfavourable and unpredictable taxation regimes.

"Experts, accountants reject proposed levy on family estates’ transfer","Tax experts have called for the rejection of a planned new tax on transfer of family estates on the grounds that it will encourage Kenyans to register family trusts outside the country.

Stakeholders giving their views on the Finance Bill, 2024 which seeks to remove the tax exemption of capital gains relating to the transfer of title of immovable property to a family trust, want the proposal deleted.

The Bill proposes to remove the tax exemption of capital gains relating to the transfer of title of immovable property. Currently, the income and principal sum of a registered family trust is exempt from income tax.

PKF Taxation Limited Services has called on the lawmakers to entirely delete the proposal saying family transfers are not commercial transactions and hence should not be subjected to tax.

In its memorandum to the committee, PKF termed the proposal as detrimental as it will discourage Kenyans from establishing registered family trusts that are beneficial for succession planning. “This may also encourage Kenyans to register family trusts outside Kenya, especially in low tax jurisdictions,” the firm says in its memorandum.

The Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) has also opposed the proposal arguing that the transfer of titles of immovable property to a family trust is not a capital gain since the beneficial ownership does not change.

Another firm Bowmans said in its memorandum that this will be a major setback, especially in the real estate in the country.

“A key reason as to why registered family trusts have become quite popular is due to the tax exemptions such as making the income of a registered family trust exempt from income tax,” the firm says in its memorandum to the committee.

Airlines warn Kenya to lose regional edge on new taxes,"Kenya will lose its regional aviation competitiveness to its neighbours if the Treasury proposal to impose value-added tax (VAT) on imported aircraft and drones is approved by Parliament, aviation lobbyists have said.

The Association of Air Operators (KAAO) and the African Airlines Association (AFRAA) said the proposed imposition of 16 percent VAT will spell doom for the local aviation industry.

The associations told the National Assembly’s Committee on Finance and National Planning that the Finance Bill 2024, which seeks to remove tax exemptions to the aviation sector, will hit the expansion of new areas like Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs).

“The intended removal of VAT exemptions will have a direct impact on our regional competitiveness and impact the advancement of Kenya’s aviation sector,” Mbuvi Ngunze, the KAAO chairman said.

“Policymakers must realise the multifaceted implications of such actions and priortise strategies to safeguard these critical exemptions in line with both the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the East African Common External Market Tariff on zero-rated taxes on aviation.”

Mr Ngunze told the committee that the effect of imposing VAT on the importation of aircraft will, for example, result in a $576,000 (Sh74,928,591.49)rise in the cost of a Cessna 208 Caravan plane and $140,800(Sh18,322,569.97) in engine overhaul for Bombardier Dash 8-200 plane.

The Finance Bill 2024 seeks to reverse the tax exemptions granted to the aviation sector in the Finance Bill, 2023.

The Treasury is seeking to introduce 16 percent VAT on the importation of aircraft and spacecraft, direction-finding compasses, instruments, and appliances for aircraft.

The Bill also seeks to impose 16 percent VAT on hiring, leasing, and chartering of fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, and balloons.

Mr Ngunze told the committee that the effect of imposing 16 percent VAT on the importation of aircraft will, for example, result in a $576,000 (Sh74,928,591.49) increase in the cost of a Cessna 208 Caravan plane and $140,800(Sh18,322,569.97) in engine overhaul for Bombardier Dash 8-200 plane.

It currently costs $3,600,000(Sh468,809,110.30) to import a Cesna 208 and $880,000(Sh114,628,316.66) to import a Bombardier Dash 8-200 engine for overhaul, respectively. With VAT it will cost $4,176,000(Sh544,136,129.41) to import a Cesna 208 and engine overhaul to $1,020,800(Sh133,020,073.91) to ship in Dash 8-200 engine.

He said the tax regime in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, and Malawi enjoy different incentives in line with both ICAO and the East African Common External Market Tariff on zero-rated taxes on aviation aimed at growing the industry.

Mr Ngunze said introducing taxes will make Kenya uncompetitive regionally and within Africa. He said in Tanzania, the importation of aircraft, aircraft engines, or parts is VAT exempt, while Uganda has zero-rated indefinitely on leased aircraft, aircraft engines, spare parts for aircraft, aircraft maintenance equipment, and repair services.

In Rwanda, Mr Ngunze said aircraft, their spare parts, and maintenance tools are VAT exempt while in Nigeria, Angola, and Mozambique they have zero-rated imports of commercial aircraft, aircraft, and parts. Malawi has exempted the importation of aircraft and spacecraft from VAT.

“Introducing VAT on importation of helicopters and spacecraft under Chapter 88 of the VAT Act will result in Kenyan operators losing their competitiveness due to increased cost of purchase, leasing or financing of these equipment,” Mr Ngunze said.

“This, in turn, will result in increased operational costs which will be cascaded down to the customers and travelling public.”

Mr Ngunze told the committee chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani that increased costs will also discourage investors from registering aircraft in the Kenyan registry hence impacting revenue generated by the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) in the forms of fees and levies.

KAAO and AFRAA the introduction of 16 percent VAT will precipitate a significant surge in acquisition costs for airlines and operators which will impede fleet modernization and expansion.

“This will also make Kenya uncompetitive to investors due to the huge costs of acquisition thereby losing out on the international arena since investors will opt for countries that have less tax implications,” Mr Ngunze said.

“This will also trigger escalations in air travel and charter services, cargo services, aerial services, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) services, balloon operations, aircraft repair, and training prices, thereby impeding the sector’s growth trajectory in maintaining and developing Kenya’s air transport system.”

He said VAT on direction-finding compasses, instruments, and appliances will translate to higher costs for aircraft maintenance which has safety implications the costs will be extremely high.

He said this will hurt local aircraft maintenance organisations since it will be cheaper to outsource maintenance activities in other countries within the region resulting in a loss of jobs.

“The introduction of VAT on hiring, leasing, and chartering aircraft poses a significant risk of escalating operational costs.”

Ruto state visit to US huge opportunity for Kenyans,"President William Ruto’s state visit to America marks a pivotal moment in its longstanding partnership with Kenya, signalling a renewed commitment to collaboration in various critical sectors.

In a dynamic global landscape of evolving security threats and economic challenges, it underscored strategic alliances in addressing shared concerns and fostering sustainable development.

At the forefront of discussions during the visit was the imperative to enhance security cooperation, particularly in combating terrorist groups in East Africa.

The acknowledgment by the White House of Kenya’s pivotal role in this endeavour led to President Joe Biden designating Kenya as a major non-Nato ally, a testament to its growing stature in the war on terror.

That not only reinforces Kenya’s position as a key partner in regional security efforts but also opens avenues for enhanced collaboration with the US in countering emerging threats.

The US also announced significant financial support for Kenya, and East Africa, to combat international criminal networks.

Transformative infrastructure projects

With a commitment of $4.9 million (Sh642 million), the funds will be directed to capacity building and reform of Kenya’s police and justice sectors to strengthen law enforcement capabilities and enhance accountability.

Such investments are crucial in addressing transnational crime and promoting the rule of law, key pillars of sustainable development and economic prosperity.

Recognising the importance of good governance in fostering economic growth, Washington pledged $1.55 million (Sh203 million) to anti-corruption programmes in Kenya.

That will support initiatives to enhance transparency in budget processes and empower civil society actors to advocate accountability and citizen engagement.

The visit also laid the groundwork for transformative infrastructure projects that will contribute to Kenya’s socioeconomic development.

The agreement to construct the Usahihi Expressway from Mombasa to Nairobi, alongside investments in affordable housing, represents a significant commitment to improving the country’s infrastructure and connectivity.

Stimulate economic growth

These projects, totaling billions of shillings, will not only create employment opportunities but also stimulate economic growth and enhance the quality of life for Kenyans.

The visit also emphasised the importance of investing in human capital and social development. The partnership extends to areas such as education and healthcare with a focus on empowering youth and disability inclusion.

Kenya can then harness the potential of its youthful population and ensure no one is left behind in the journey towards prosperity.

The historic visit signifies a milestone in Kenya’s diplomatic relations and sets the stage for a new chapter of collaboration and partnership.

The multi-billion-shilling investment deals and strategic alliances announced underscore a shared commitment to addressing common challenges and advancing mutual interests.

As Kenya navigates the complexities of a rapidly changing world, strengthened ties with the US provide a solid foundation for sustainable development and prosperity for all.

Insure against risks of extreme weather events,"Climate change events like the recent flooding in Kenya cause massive loss of lives and destruction of property and infrastructure worth billions of shillings.

Such calamities pose serious risk to lives, livelihoods, businesses, economy and society.

This is the right time to find ways of managing such risks, given their dire humanitarian and financial consequences.

Climate scientists have warned that natural disasters like flooding, storms and drought are becoming more intense, frequent and dangerous owing to global warming, widely acknowledged to be the primary driver of climate change.

There is glaring evidence that the earth is heating rapidly with July 2023 declared by the World Meteorological Organization as the hottest month in 120,000 years!

Heat waves and heavy floods worldwide have been directly linked to this phenomenon. Other than inflicting massive harm on humanity, such disruptive weather events are making places hitherto considered safe more vulnerable to climate-related risks.

Areas close to riparian zones and wetlands are at even greater risk of inaccessibility.

Protection against loss

The science shows climate change is long-term and it is difficult to rule out the probability of such disasters recurring, and on a larger scale.

It is only prudent that we put in place measures like insurance to handle the extreme weather-related risks.

Insurance basically exists to protect individuals, families and businesses from risks. While it may not prevent death, injury or damage or loss of property, it reduces the financial risk or burden of illness, accidents and other human or natural calamities.

In the case of life insurance, the bereaved family is able to pay its bills and meet other expenses for a period after the breadwinner’s death.

Home insurance offers protection against loss or destruction to a house and its contents due to fire, burglary and water damage, ensuring valuables are safeguarded.

The same logic applies to businesses. For instance, insuring a business against the risk of floods minimises unexpected loss arising from damage to the premises, goods or equipment to the extent covered under the policy.

Risk-management tool

Importantly, it ensures continuity since the underwriter compensates the business owner for the insured damage or loss, providing a financial lifeline for the affected enterprise.

Contrary to popular (mis)conceptions, insurance is not just another avoidable expense but effective risk-management tool.

Some people argue that taking out insurance is to risk losing money if the insured event does not materialise. But what if it does? There is the obvious risk of losing everything!

Insurance products are varied and generally categorised into ‘life’ and ‘general’. Some directly address climate impacts. For example, crop and livestock insurance compensates farmers for drought-related losses.

Some underwriters insure against floods, which also covers storms, and personal valuables.

The essence of having insurance is that when catastrophe strikes, you, your family and your business will be financially protected thus averting penury, or having to fundraise to settle bills.

Private sector is a key driver of workforce development,"For a long time, NGOs have been the channel of choice for delivering development assistance, especially in contexts where the government was unable to reach vulnerable populations.

Private sector roles have largely been limited to providing financial services.

NGOs play a vital role in lifting communities and individuals out of poverty and its attendant manifestations around health, education and access to essential services but their interventions can be fragmented and, therefore, limited in delivering broad social change.

Within donor discourses, there is a growing circumspection about creating dependency in recipient communities with development assistance now more focused on giving more hands up rather than handouts.

It is now commonly accepted that aid alone cannot lead to development; hence the focus on trade, investment and job creation, which private businesses support, as channels for affirming individual agency.

Business environment

Donors can redirect to the private sector the Sh500 billion they give Kenya yearly via NGOs and civil society.

The idea may sound radical but the perceived contradictions are more historical than they are objective.

Many bilateral donors are engaging with the private sector to improve the business environment by boosting ethical business practices, adopting technology such as AI and providing equity investment.

Business incentives converge with the country’s strategies and donor priorities more often than is commonly acknowledged.

Businesses have an interest in a skilled work force, and therefore investments in education speak to future labour needs. The private sector create between 80 and 90 per cent of all new jobs.

Private sector’s potential

Private businesses are more agile and responsive to global trends, driving innovation and competitiveness.

The “World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023” states that 23 per cent of jobs are expected to change in the next five years, driven by industry transformation caused by increased adoption of technology, the green transition and macro-economic conditions.

Bolder initiatives by donors can create an enabling environment for businesses to expand to unlock the private sector’s potential and generate a ripple effect of job creation, increased investment, as well as financial prosperity.

Governments seek economic growth and international development organisations to cultivate wealthier potential customers for their markets.

Both can drive partnerships with the private sector more aggressively to create jobs as a way of achieving sustainable economic growth and general prosperity.

Why AI could be the Fourth Revolution,"Ever-changing technology has been the hallmark of education over the centuries.

According to Sir Anthony Seldon, the First Revolution happened five million years ago with the beginning of learning by watching and repeating.

The second, the beginning of organised learning in schools, followed some 5,000 years ago and the third roughly 500 years ago because of the invention of the printing press and great global expansion of universities.

The press has since dominated educational technology — with faltering dalliance with the cinema, radio and television education. Artificial intelligence (AI) now stands to change the trajectory.

It has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education, including teaching, learning and innovation.

AI is likely to change the way curriculum is delivered and assessed. It is likely to reduce the teacher workload as preparation of lesson plans, schemes of work and marking of assignments.

That will allow teachers to assign exercises to learners and monitor their progress while maintaining the essential human element.

Interpersonal relationships

But despite the advancement in technology, students will still need the critical skills for the 21st Century — like critical thinking, collaboration, communication and creativity.

AI will personalise teaching and tutoring, helping students feel good about their learning.

The mental health issues caused by grading or a school system, whereby success is pegged on passing of a summative examination, dampening the youth’s self-esteem, will be a thing of the past.

Virtual reality will make learning of STEM and humanities more enjoyable and easier to understand.

AI will also help develop all types of intelligence, not just cognitive intelligence, on which school systems overwhelmingly focus, including creativity, interpersonal relationships, character, leadership skill and self-knowledge.

The world over, schools are working to prepare students for 21st Century skills as training programmes prepares teachers to adopt related pedagogy. Governments are working on the relevant policies.

As Alwin Toffler says, the illiterate of the 21st Century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who can’t learn, unlearn and relearn.

Food safety is paramount,"The theme of agriculture and food security for this year’s Madaraka Day was apt.

Food security and safety is a growing critical public health issue due to its association with foodborne diseases (FBD) with significant morbidity and mortality rates. But most FBDs are preventable.

The WHO says developing nations experience poor food handling and sanitation practices, absence of strong food safety laws, weak regulatory systems, lack of financial resources and unhygienic food handling methods.

It outlines 10 rules for safe food practices. They include choosing foods processed for safety, cooking food thoroughly, eating cooked food immediately, storing cooked foods carefully and reheating cooked foods thoroughly.

Others are avoiding contact between raw and cooked foods, washing hands repeatedly, keeping kitchen surfaces clean, protecting foods from insects, rodents and other animals and, lastly, using safe water.

Food safety practices

The Health and Agriculture ministries should conduct studies on food safety practices among food handlers; there’s a probability of higher standards among those supervised by health professionals.

Providing sufficient, affordable, nutritious and safe food for the growing population is a challenge, especially as governments are expected to provide food security without causing climate change, degrading water and land resources and eroding biodiversity.

The 1996 World Food Summit defines food security as “when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”.

The FAO outlines four food security dimensions: Availability, access, utilisation and stability.

Food safety is the foundation of trust in the food business. Small and medium-sized businesses often don’t realise that not applying food safety and quality improvement measures is more expensive.

Cyndi Lauper: The life and career of legendary pop singer comes in a new documentary,"It has been almost four decades since Cyndi Lauper recorded her signature songs, Time after Time, True Colors, and Girls Just Want to Have Fun. Today, these songs are still a staple on radio stations and streaming playlists.

Back in the 1980s, Lauper was rated among the most successful female pop stars in the world. It was not just her distinctive high voice, brightly coloured hair and outrageous fashion sense that earned her fame; Lauper has been a fierce advocate for social change, especially women’s rights.

The story of the life and career of the legendary singer, songwriter is told in a new documentary Let the Canary Sing that premiered on Paramount Plus streaming platform this week. The film is accompanied by an album of the same time which contains a career retrospective with Lauper’s greatest hits.

“Over the years, I have been asked to do a documentary about my life and work, but it never felt the right time,” she said in a statement about the film. But that changed when she met award-winning director Alison Ellwood, in whom she has placed the trust to tell her story honestly,

The title of the film is taken from a ruling in a lawsuit that an ex-manager filed to retain control of Lauper’s music after she left the band Blue Angel for her solo career. The judge dismissed the case with the pronouncement: “Let the canary sing”.

The story traces Lauper’s childhood growing up in the Queens borough of New York to becoming an international superstar with a career spanning more than 40 years in music, film and theatre.

Her elder sister Elen Lauper recalls how they danced around the house swinging brooms and mops, to songs by the Beatles, Cyndi singing John Lennon’s parts while she did Paul McCartney voice.

She left her childhood home at age 17 to escape an abusive stepfather, and tried a series of jobs including shoe saleswoman, waitress and an office assistant “typing 19 words and a minute”.

When none of those satisfied her restless soul, she turned up for music auditions singing some of her favourite songs like I Really Got to Use my Imagination by Motown legend Gladys Knight.

“I was really surprised at what was coming out of my mouth,” she says, in reference to her ability to hold high notes. She began writing her own material with keyboardist John Turi and the duo formed the group Blue Angel, recording just one album in 1980. Lauper’s big break came in 1983 when she released her debut solo album, She’s So Unusual.

Read: A concert of African music at its finest

The first single from the album, Girls Just Want to Have Fun was written by Robert Hazard as a rock song from a man’s perspective but Lauper flipped it to become an anthem for feminism. As the documentary reveals, her record company had given up any hope of success for the single after radio stations initially failed to embrace it.

All that changed after the music video for Girls Just Want to Have Fun, a novelty for that era, hit the airwaves with a cast that included the singer’s mother and wrestling legend Captain Lou Albano playing the role of Lauper’s father.

“I wore red because red is the power colour,” says Lauper about her choice of costume for the video which has to date been watched more than 1 billion times on YouTube. Thanks to the success of that album, Lauper won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1985 picking up her trophy accompanied by another wrestling star, Hulk Hogan, as her bodyguard.

One of the highlights from the documentary is the video of Lauper going toe-to-toe on stage with one of her idols Patti Labelle during a performance of her ballad Time After Time in 1985. The following year, True Colors was written as a tribute to a friend who was dying from AIDS at a time when people who had contracted the disease were shunned.

“I wanted to speak to a human being in the most tender spot,” she says in the film. “I had to learn the power of the whisper.” She founded the True Colors Fund to address youth homelessness in the US and in 2015 appeared before a US Senate subcommittee to testify on addressing the problem.

As the commercial impact of her albums waned, Lauper appeared in film roles and found success in theatre, writing the music for the Tony Award-winning Broadway production Kinky Boots in 2013. Her music has also impacted a new generation when rapper Nicki Minaj sampled Girls Just Want to Have Fun on her 2023 single Pink Friday Girls.

This week 70-year-old Lauper announced her Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Farewell Tour across 23 cities in North America beginning October this year. It certainly will not be the last time that the world hears from this icon who has created a phenomenal legacy out of being unusual.

Strictly enforce laws to curb looting in counties,"Many good things have been said about the counties’ role in devolution, which has, over the past 10 years, enabled the transfer of sizeable resources from the centre to the grassroots to boost national development.

However, the same 47 devolved units have also gained notoriety for mismanagement, corruption, outright theft and plunder of public resources.

There has not been anything in recent years that evokes such mixed feelings. The Auditor-General and the Controller of Budget continue to document irregularities and illegalities.

And even as they wallow in wanton wastage and disorganisation, the counties have accumulated huge debts.

The counties’ failure to clear a Sh3 billion debts owed to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa), for example, has contributed to the acute shortage of essential drugs in public hospitals.

But these same counties have also enabled the building of hospitals and schools across the country.

It is a big shame, therefore, that county officials so flagrantly break the law and hamper transparency and accountability.

Lack of checks and balances

Nowhere is this more pronounced than in their defiance of the law by opening too many accounts with commercial banks, of course with ulterior motives.

The counties have in the past three months opened 287 accounts with commercial banks, most probably to evade scrutiny on the spending of public funds.

The Controller of Budget has flagged the increase from 1,381 accounts at the end of last year to 1,668 in March this year.

The number could actually be higher as some of the counties did not disclose everything.

Under the law, the counties are only allowed to open and maintain accounts at the Central Bank of Kenya for ease of accountability. The exemption is for some imprest accounts for petty cash and revenue collection.

Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang’o has often exposed the lack of checks and balances and shady deals that enable the looting of taxpayers’ funds. The officials responsible for these breaches are not above the law.

The Senate, which has an oversight role over the counties, must promptly take decisive action to ensure they comply and protect public resources.

Boost Kiswahili for unity,"Although the East African coast is the origin of Kiswahili, the language has spread across the region and beyond and is today spoken by more than 200 million people.

Its importance as a key medium of communication in sub-Saharan Africa cannot be gainsaid.

This regional lingua franca is also spoken in parts of the Middle East and is increasingly gaining ground in academic circles.

It is taught in universities in Africa and elsewhere, including Germany and the United States.

The national and official language of Kenya and Tanzania is also the most widely studied indigenous language in Africa, with a rich cultural heritage.

Kenya’s preparations to host the 2024 World Kiswahili Day on July 7 — which will be the first ever — are in top gear.

Already, the organisers are favouring Mombasa, a region that has a rich Kiswahili legacy. President William Ruto is expected to preside over the July 5-7 celebrations.

Kiswahili-Speaking Day

To further promote the language, the organisers are also considering a National Kiswahili-Speaking Day. Then, the President, top government officials, judges, civil servants and teachers will exclusively speak in Kiswahili.

The inaugural Kiswahili day was held in Zanzibar and the second one in Kampala, last year.

Kiswahili is also an official language of the African Union and has, since 2020, been taught in South Africa’s schools. It is also an official working language of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

The EAC Treaty provides for the development and promotion of indigenous languages, especially Kiswahili, as the lingua franca of the region.

Kiswahili has earned pride of place as a global language for social exchange and business.

It is a most-unifying force as, unlike other international languages, it's not claimed by a particular ethnic group or country. It should be promoted to enhance regional unity and global solidarity.

Cats: Broadways smash hit musical comes to Karen,"Kenyan audiences have been enchanted by the award-winning musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber ever since the 1970’s when Jesus Christ Superstar first hit the boards at the Donovan Maule Theatre.

Since then, the JCS classic has been staged everywhere from secondary schools and churches to the Kenya National Theatre and Braeburn Theatre, Gitanga where we most recently saw another Lloyd Webber classic, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat which was staged by Braeburn school just a few months ago.

The BDLife first saw Jesus Christ Superstar at the now defunct Donovan Maule Theatre in the 1980s. It was also the premiere production of the Nairobi Performing Arts Studio in 2018.

But nobody’s been ambitious enough, until now, to present us with the musical production inspired by T.S. Eliot’s poetry book entitled Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. It’s called Cats and it was a smash hit on Broadway and The West End of London.

The Nobel Prize-winning poet had originally written his cats poetry especially for his God-children. But children are not the only cat-lovers who have contributed to the show’s popularity. There are adults all over the world (be they cat owners or not) who have watched the show and read Eliot’s illustrated poetry, often in translation.

The book came out in 1939 and was made famous after Lloyd Webber came out with his musical interpretation of it, calling it Cats in 1981. It quickly made its way to Broadway and the West End of London where it was a smash hit more popular than nearly all 31 of Lloyd Webber’s other musicals (apart from Joseph, Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita and Phantom of the Opera).

Now it’s finally opening in Nairobi out at Brookhouse School in Karen from Friday, June 7th through Sunday, June 9th.

Cooper Rust and her team at Dance Centre Kenya (DCK) have been working for months to prepare a production that not only features non-stop dancing by the DCK troupe, including 63 dancers ranging in age from 6 to 50. They will also be dressed up as cats, from their heads and faces to their tails and toes.

“All of our costumes have been painted by local artists,” says Cooper Rust, Cats’ artistic director, producer, and co-founder of DCK back in 2015. She was speaking in an exclusive interview to the BDLife a few days before the musical’s opening day. She added that Cats’ head-gear, including the whiskers and upright ears were all made locally. And even the cat caps that the little ones will wear are hand-crafted. The same is true of the cat masks.

And even the cat caps which the little ones will wear were created by friends of DCK. But it’s the catsy face paintings of everyone in the cast, that will add 100 percent cat credibility to the performers and their performance over the weekend.

Having such a large cast, Cooper has gotten tremendous support from her assistant directors Caroline Slot who has been with DCK practically from its inception in 2015 and May Ombara who initially came to DCK as a voice coach for Oliver but will now also play Grizabella this weekend.

Cats is the second major musical that DCK has produced. “We’ll be producing one musical every year,” promised Cooper. “We feel it’s important for our students to expand their versatility and range of artistic expression,” she added.

DCK already has classes in musical theatre, but Oliver was its first application of the learning that some students in the show have already received. And ballet itself is filled with theatrical expression, but it’s not the same since ballet, which is DCK’s specialty, focuses more specifically on the dance.

Musical theatre pays greater attention to the story, adding both songs and dance aimed at taking the storyline forward. It’s a subtle difference, but it makes a lot of sense for DCK graduates to have a broad repertoire of dance when they complete the DCK course. But that doesn’t come until after students are examined and pass rigorous tests administered by judges from the Royal Academy of Dance in UK.

A year ago when DCK staged their first musical, Oliver, they received awards at the Kenya Theatre Awards for performances by John Sibi Okumu as Fagin and Abdoulaye Diabete as Oliver.

The musical generally met with wide ranging approval, especially as all the music was live, as it will be this weekend when the DCK Orchestra takes on Lloyd Webber’s musical score and is professionally conducted under the baton of Levi Wataka.

Finance Bill 2024 bad for the economy,"The Finance Bill 2024 will change the Kenyan economic and business environment way beyond recognition.

As you read the Bill, you find an avalanche of ill-conceived amendments that have introduced what I can only describe as legal litter in our fiscal laws.

Never in the history of changes and amendments to our fiscal laws in this country has a Finance Bill been greeted with such widespread lamentations and outrage by such a broad spectrum of organised industry, professional associations and independent voices.

The way I see it, this country is standing on the escalator of anarchy and chaos.

The reason I insist that what we are witnessing is anarchy is the display of arrogance of power by both parliament and the executive manifested by the fact that the latter seems bent on introducing multiple changes to our fiscal laws without giving due consideration to suggestions and genuine criticisms by businesses and other wealth-creating segments of our society.

Today, genuine and legitimate criticism and lamentations are impulsively waved aside and dismissed as rantings of vested interests.

Beer maker, Kenya Breweries, is lamenting that because of the perennial tinkering with excise duties, beer prices in Kenya are three times higher than in Uganda and twice higher than in Tanzania.

In the case of spirits, the brewer has lamented that the Finance Bill will introduce a regime where it will have to pay excise duty on both inputs and the final product. The brewer is lamenting that the proposed excise duty regime will make legitimate alcohol unaffordable and suggested that the changes be introduced incrementally to allow the company to plan.

It has also complained that the new proposal in the Bill that requires it to remit excise duties to KRA within five days will badly hurt its cash flows.

The lamentations of the edible oil manufacturers have been louder. The proposed 25 percent duty on vegetable oils will cause the prices of edible oils to skyrocket.

That when you add the proposal to impose excise duty on raw materials, the Finance Bill will cause the cost of the finished product to go up by 50 percent rendering the local industry unable to compete within both Comesa and the regional bloc.

That the only option open for them is to relocate their operations to either Uganda, Tanzania or Rwanda.

The cement industry is howling that the proposals in the Finance Bill will administer euthanasia to the industry. The excise duty rate the government is proposing to impose on coal plus the new eco- tax will cause the taxes and duties to be more expensive than the coal itself.

The financial services sector is also grieving. That the plan to impose VAT on financial services will have adverse effects on the cost of borrowing to the manufacturing sector because the sector does not have the means to offset the charges.

That the removal of banking services from the VAT-exempt list will impact loans and critical banking services that are already at historic highs.

Similar lamentations have been heard from the pharmaceutical sector, paint manufacturers, makers of pesticides and the telecommunications sector.

Yet the fact that both parliament and the government appear not to be in a listening mood is just part of the problem.

This economy will not experience a sustainable turnaround until we inject the ‘S’ factor into our fiscal laws- stable, simple and sane.

The arbitrariness with which the proposals for removing exemptions and zero ratings in this year’s Finance Bill speak volumes to the whimsical and capricious manner in which amendments to our fiscal laws are implemented.

If you invest in a business on the basis of tax holidays or exemptions introduced in this year’s Finance Bill, can you be sure that the incentive regime that gave you the incentive to invest will continue to be the law when actual operations of that business commence five years later? How stable are our fiscal laws?

Here is an example. In July 2022, the government granted duty remission for approved manufacturers under the EAC remission scheme.

This encouraged investors including entities such as the brand, M-Kopa to invest in the local assembly of mobile phones.

In July 2023, the government decided to enhance the incentives through zero rating on locally assembled smartphones.

Today, the Finance Bill is proposing not only to reverse the zero-rating but to introduce VAT on locally assembled phones.

I don’t see the difference between a tax-evading citizen and a promise-evading government.

Beyond: Munene Kariuki spotlights migration barriers,"Munene Kariuki is a visionary and a realist combined. As a painter currently having his first solo exhibition at One Off Gallery, one can see he also has both intuitive insights and first-hand knowledge of what most Kenyans feel they need to obtain the quality of life that is fit for themselves and their families.

How he translates all that knowledge into visually interesting art is the stuff of his showcase of work that he entitles ‘Beyond’ at One Off. It’s the visionary in him that sees what’s required to get beyond all the obstacles, restrictions, and barriers, both physical and mental. It’s also the undercurrent of thought that offers hope despite the distress that people on the move are currently feeling.

Munene Kariuki’s ‘Labour Export’ at the One Off Gallery during his solo exhibition titled ‘Beyond’ on May 30, 2024.

Migration is a theme that Munene had been exploring long before the Covid-19 lockdown laid out so many barriers to people’s movement on a worldwide scale. People’s motivation for migrating ranged from mainly wars or economic hardship. Yet what Munene captures in his art are mainly portraits of people encountering specific obstacles to their momentum.

For instance, a work like ‘Remittance’ relates to the one who manages to get overseas, but then he’s constrained by family pressure to remit funds meant to sustain whole families. Yet little does family understand the hardships encountered.

His illustration of unemployment entitled ‘Seat 1’ and ‘Seat 2’ is a diptych, each side filled with a room-full of people but just one seat. Munene’s symbolism is often accessible, but in some instances not so much. In several of the 33 paintings in this show, many use either red and yellow ribbons or barrels to symbolise the obstacle impeding the migrants’ movement forward.

His ‘Labor Export’ feels especially relevant as Munene has painted men standing in a box. It’s the sort that farmers pack their potatoes in. In light of news that Kenyan troops are heading to Haiti or the Middle East where they’ll fight Houthi rebels, it’s Munene the visionary who painted his ‘Labor Export’ long before the President volunteered Kenyans to go.

Meanwhile, the precarious nature of a migrant’s life (be he coming from Eritrea or Pakistan) is suggested in his painting ‘The Journey’. In it, there’s only an inflatable boat and two hangman’s nooses. “You see that key painted next to the boat?” He asks the BDLife. “The key is meant to represent a successful journey, but you can see there’s no success here,” he adds referring specifically all the African migrants who cross the Sahara to reach Libya where they prepare their boat, hopefully to get them across the Mediterranean. But more frequently, it does not.

Other topics that Munene covers  range widely from ‘gender imbalance’ and ‘Biometrics’ (a form of global surveillance) to being ‘Distressed’ (and other mental issues related to stress) and the adage illustrated by Munene to mean to ‘Tighten up your belt’ or Kaza Mshipi in Kiswahili. It’s what Kenyans have been told to do in light of inflation, taxation, and in some cases, even starvation.

Munene never actually studied fine art in college, apart from the online courses he’s taken on YouTube. Otherwise, he was on his way to becoming a computer systems analyst while getting his first degree from Kenya Methodist University. He can’t say what exactly happened for him to take an about face and decide to become an artist.

“It was my mother who kept recommending that I go into the arts,” Munene says. So he dug in. He had already been going around to see art exhibition and got really good advice from Michael Musyoka at Brush tu Artists Collective. He also attended numerous workshops organised locally. That included one for refugee artists which is where he began to see how profound and complex is the problem of migration, especially when someone has to flee their country to save their life.

It was from his work with refugee artists that he was invited to University of Manchester to talk about migration and the incentive it has given him to create a work like ‘Misplaced Reality’. It was about people coming to and going from our region, specifically Kenya. Both sides encounter barriers to both enter and exit this country.

“It’s ironic that while many Africans want to go abroad for better education, better health care, better job prospects; meanwhile, Europeans (and now Chinese) are looking for ways to come into the country and stay,” he adds.

Naivas Supermarket’s graduate program targets to briidge the skills gap,"Naivas supermarket has taken it upon itself to train its staff to deliver quality services to customers.

Speaking during the graduation of the first cohort of graduate trainees in Nairobi, the Chief of Strategy Mr Andreas Von Paleske said the program aims to not only create jobs for the graduates, especially fresh ones from colleges and universities, but equip them with the best customer service skills.

He said that the graduate trainee program is conducted in partnership with some colleges in Nairobi.

“The graduate application training is open to everyone in the country. We assess them on their capabilities and skills. We don’t just take people for the sake of working but for the sake of building their careers. Our trainees are taught various skills on the retail operation,” said Mr Anderes.

The supermarket came up with the program after it emerged that customers preferred to be served with respect and professionalism.

Through the training, the graduates don’t just learn the required skills to provide better customer service, but also how to professionally handle all the chain’s customers countrywide.

“We were looking for a whole range of degrees but mostly a person’s desire and skills to be able to succeed in this career. We as a business would want to succeed and grow. That requires that we offer Kenyans the best possible services through having great people,” said Mr Anderes.

According to him, the labour market is already struggling with a significant skill gap which is a challenge to both employers and employees.

During the graduation ceremony, 35 trainees graduated after a rigorous 12-month training.

Those graduating are absorbed as Naivas employees.

Naivas supermarket is part of the retail industry that contributes about nine per cent of Kenya’s gross domestic product (GDP), which is crucial to the country's economy.

The supermarket which was started 33 years ago has a workforce of more than 8,000 operating from 90 different locations countrywide.

Ex-City Hall finance chief faces setback in bid to save Runda home,"Former Nairobi County Chief Finance Officer Jimmy Kiamba has temporarily lost his bid to save his Runda home from being forfeited to the State as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

This is after the High Court declined to issue conservatory orders suspending the execution or implementation of all directives made under some sections of the Anti-Corruption & Economic Act.

Justice Olga Sewe directed that preliminary objections filed by the Attorney General (AG) and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the petition by Mr Kiamba be heard first.

“The prayer for conservatory orders in terms of prayer two in the notice of motion is declined pending hearing and determination of the preliminary objections,” ruled Justice Sewe.

Mr Kiamba and his spouse Tracy Musau had moved to court challenging the constitutionality of some Sections of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act (Aceca).

The petitioners are also seeking to have their matrimonial home excluded from the list of properties to be forfeited to the state as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

They are also seeking to have an order issued that they be at liberty to liquidate their property to settle the claim with the EACC.

On Thursday, through lawyer Leonard Shimaka, Mr Kiamba and Ms Musau told the court that it was in the interest of justice that they be granted the conservatory orders as they argue the case.

However, the AG and EACC through lawyers Janet Lang’at and Faith Ng’ethe opposed the issuance of the conservatory orders arguing that one of the issues they had raised in their preliminary objections, touched on the jurisdiction of the court.

In their petition, Mr Kiamba and Ms Musau claim that some sections of the Aceca are in direct conflict and contravention of the constitution, specifically the Bill of Rights as they prescribe a procedure in which an individual is adjudged and instantly presumed guilty until proven otherwise in the ‘eyes’ of the law.

The petitioners state that the procedure laid down presupposes a ‘mini-trial’ conducted by the EACC which after investigations is incumbent upon the anti-graft agency to invite rebuttal evidence before it can recommend either prosecution or acquittal of anticipated charges against the suspect.

The petitioners are seeking a declaration that Sections 55 (1),55 (2) (b),55 (6),55 (9),56 (1) &56 (2) of Aceca are inconsistent and contravene Articles 50 (2) (a),50 (2) (K),50 (2) (n),159 (2) (e) and 160 (1) of the constitution are unconstitutional null and void.

Upon declaration of the unconstitutionality of the Sections, the petitioners want a declaration that the orders of the High Court and the Court of Appeal, in the cases where Mr Kiamba and three others were involved, in so far as they are pegged on the sections be declared to have no force in law.

Alternatively, the petitioners want their matrimonial home situated in Runda Water Estate, Nairobi to be excluded from forfeiture by the state as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

Mr Kiamba says that during the pendency of his employment, he managed to build his income through savings and by building rapport with different financial institutions and was able to start wheat and livestock farming and later build hotels in Mombasa and Machakos.

According to the petitioners, Ms Musau, a career interior designer built her business from scratch through the establishment of an interior design company which later ‘gave birth’ to a beauty parlour enabling her to acquire a property which was leased out to supplement her income.

They say that sometime in 2014, unknown to them, EACC commenced investigations on them and their dealings including but not limited to registered companies they had an interest in and it formed an opinion that they had unexplained assets.

The petitioners also say that EACC filed a case at the High Court for forfeiture of the unexplained assets and at the end of the case the court believed that the assets were unexplained and were to be forfeited to the state.

They argue that they tendered evidence that their young family was at least entitled to protection by the constitution regarding rights attributable to a family, children and their presumptive right to own property meaning that the attachment and forfeiture of their matrimonial home would render them homeless and deprive their children of their rights.

The case will be mentioned on June 19, 2024 for further directions.

"Kenya's population to hit 70m amidst fertility decline, new report","Kenya’s population is projected to hit 70.2m in the next two decades with the demographic composition morphing into a more youthful structure, according to a new report by the National Council for Population and Development (NCPD).

Despite the declining fertility rate, the number of Kenyans is expected to reach 57.8m by 2045 and continue growing over the next 50 – 60 years with the present population momentum.

Since 1999, Kenya’s population has grown exponentially with an additional one million people annually, according to the Sessional Paper No.1 of 2023 on Kenya National Population Policy for Sustainable Development.

There were 47.6 million people enumerated in the Kenya Population and Housing Census 2019 which was 4.3 times the population enumerated in 1969 during the first census taken after independence.

The country had a 2.3 per cent growth rate yearly between 2009 and 2019 a decrease from 2.9 per cent between 1999 and 2009, as indicated in the 5th Sessional Paper.

Speaking during the report launch on Thursday, The National Treasury Cabinet Secretary, Njuguna Ndung’u, noted that, “population growth has its own dynamics which are—mortality, fertility, and migration. These three factors are, in turn, closely tied to the development discourse.”

“Rapid population change if not addressed or matched with income growth can magnify development challenges. A young population requires adequate human capital development facilitation to cater for diverse demands,” stated CS Ndung’u who represented the Chief Guest, Prime Cabinet Secretary, Musalia Mudavadi at the launch.

The report also shows age transformation in Kenya’s population structure with the country moving from child to youthful population with a median age of about 20 years.

According to the NCPD Director General, Mohamed Sheikh, the proportion of the youth, persons in the working age, women of reproductive age, and older persons has increased while the number of children aged below 15 has been on the decline since 1999.

Dr Sheikh explains that the proportion of the population in the 0-14 age group is an indicator of the youthfulness of a country’s population.

Read: A different look at Kenya’s growing number of people

In 2019, children aged 0-14 in Kenya constituted 39 percent of the total population thus implying that the country’s population is still youthful.

According to the Finance Minister, a youthful age structure, from a demographic perspective, ensures that the population will continue to grow even if average fertility drops to the “replacement level” – the level at which each generation bears the exact number of children needed to replace itself.

The report, however, states that changes in the population age structure have direct implications for the population growth as well as the production and consumption of resources.

Read: More Kenyans sink into poverty in latest report by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics

These changes and implications are inextricably tied to the development progress because age influences people’s social and economic behaviour and needs.

For Kenya to gain from the demographic transition, commonly known as the demographic dividend, NCPD has urged the government to put in place and implement appropriate economic and social policies, particularly in health and education.

“Vulnerable populations requiring special attention include orphaned children below 18 years of age, older persons aged 60 and above, intersex persons and persons with disability.”

Anglican Church says new taxes to push more Kenyans into poverty,"Anglican Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit has petitioned Parliament to scrap punitive taxes that directly impact the poor and vulnerable.

He told the National Assembly’s Finance and National Planning committee that the proposed imposition of taxes would disproportionately affect those with the least ability to pay.

Mr Ole Sapit implored the committee to delete all provisions in the Finance Bill 2024 that propose to impose taxation on bread, cooking oil, sacrament and altar wine, financial services, diapers, sanitary pads and medical dressings, transportation of sugarcane, agricultural pests, electric motor vehicles, and the motor vehicle levy.

“Increased taxes on essential goods and services will lead to higher cost of living, making it difficult for low-income families to afford necessities,” Mr Ole Sapit said.

“Additional tax burdens will push more people into extreme poverty, widening existing inequalities, and entrenching vulnerabilities.”

The Treasury has proposed to impose a 16 percent value-added tax (VAT) on bread, 25 percent excise duty on vegetable cooking oil, 16 percent VAT on financial services as well as an increase of excise duty on financial services from the current 15 percent to 20 percent.

The Bill also seeks to impose 16 percent VAT on forex transactions and processing of cheques as well as a 10 to 20 percent increase in the cost of MPesa and money transfer charges.

The Treasury is also proposing to impose an annual 2.5 percent motor vehicle tax based on the value of the vehicle and the eco levy of Sh150 per kilogramme on all articles of plastic packaging materials.

The Treasury is seeking to net at least Sh58 billion from the imposition of motor vehicle tax. The Finance Bill, 2024 seeks to raise a total of Sh302 billion to finance the Sh3.9 trillion budget for 2024/25.

In a lengthy presentation that culminated in a prayer to members of the committee, Mr Ole Sapit asked lawmakers to avoid increasing taxes on essential goods and services, including bread and vegetable oil.

“Implement targeted tax relief measures for low-income individuals and businesses, especially SMEs to support their recovery and growth post-Covid-19,” Mr Ole Sapit said.

“Bread is a staple food for Kenyans, especially those in low-income households. Increasing the cost of bread through VAT will directly exacerbate the cost of living, deepen poverty, and increase vulnerability among the population.”

Mr Ole Sapit asked MPs to remove altar wine and unleavened bread from the list of items that are subject to 16 percent VAT.

“There should be a kind of a caveat on things like unleavened bread and altar wine. You must help us by removing altar wines from other wines on the shelves and unleavened bread from other breads so that we can concentrate on giving Kenyans Holy Communion. Let the rest enjoy their normal bread and wine,” Mr Ole Sapit said.

The Anglican archbishop said imposing a 25 percent excise duty on vegetable oils, including raw materials and refined products will greatly impact on low-income families, increasing the cost of living and reducing their disposable income.

He said subjecting 16 percent VAT on transportation of sugarcane from farms to milling factories will directly raise the final produce prices that will be borne by consumers.

“As the cost of locally produced sugar rises, its competitiveness against cheaper imported sugar will diminish,” he said.

The Anglican archbishop asked MPs to abolish the proposed motor vehicle tax pegged at 2.5 percent of the value of the vehicle, saying it will increase the cost of owning and operating a vehicle.

“Public transport operators might pass on additional costs to commuters, increasing transportation costs,” Mr Ole Sapit said.

“It could also lead to job losses in the transport and logistics sector and discouraged investments in the automobile industry.”

Mr Ole Sapit asked the committee to strike out proposals to impose eco-levy and VAT on electric motor vehicles, bicycles, and lithium batteries.

He also asked the committee to undertake a comprehensive study to understand the potential economic and social impacts, particularly on lower-income groups and SMEs before implementing tax increases.

He also recommended exploring avenues of implementing stringent measures to reduce government wastage and misappropriation of funds, instead.

They have several unanswered questions and are still in utter shock as they lost three people in puzzling circumstances.Their tribulations started in April 2017 when her husband’s body was found in the evening lying on a footpath a few meters from his house.She was running a business in Marigat, Baringo South when she received a call from her eldest son.“Gilbert informed me that his father had been found lying on a footpath to our house, unresponsive. He had informed the area chief and neighbours and it was established that he was already dead,” recalled Chesaro.Locals suspect that the deceased was murdered elsewhere and his body dumped on the footpath to his house as a cover-up.Due to financial constraints, Rose says the family did not follow up on the matter and opted for closure and buried him.“A post-mortem to ascertain his cause of death was not conducted either. He was buried a week later. To date, we do not know what led to his death,” she told Nation.Africa.But it would turn out that it was not over for the family.In April 2019, her first son left the village for Ronda, in Nakuru town,  to look for a job.He was initially working at the United Republic Party (URP) office in Nairobi before returning to the village to engage in development projects.He had secured a job at a hotel in Ronda, where he worked for eight months before his mysterious demise.“He left the URP office when the party was merged and came back to the village. He was very hard-working and had great ambitions to improve our family. He started by building his house, farming, and even went ahead to do a traditional marriage,” she said.

He stayed there until November when he called me that he would come home on December 4, 2019, to spend the Christmas festivities with his family and also finalise the construction of his house that had initially stalled. He even promised to buy us a goat to eat at that time,” said the distraught woman.On December 3, the family received reports that he had not arrived at his aunt’s house, where he was staying while working at the hotel. We asked his friends, relatives, and even neighbours in Nakuru town about his whereabouts to no avail,” she noted.A few days later, their frantic search ended at the Nakuru Provincial General Hospital morgue, where his body was after being collected by police at Kaptembwo police station on December 4 at 10 am while floating in River Ndarugu, where he used to cross to reach his aunt’s house.

A post-mortem report conducted at the facility indicated that the 29-year-old died after being hit by a blunt object on the head and his back. He was thrown into the River as a cover-up that he died by drowning.He had also been robbed of his belongings, including money, phone, and identification documents.“We were told by the morgue attendants that the body was found floating in River Ndarugu and were told to report the case at Kaptembwo police station. We were so devastated because the incident happened just two years after we buried his father and we saw no need to follow up on the matter. We just resorted to putting a closure on the matter by burying his remains instead,” said Ms Chesaro.

Death had robbed me of a hard-working person. The world had just conspired against me,” she said.After the passing on of their brother, her two sons, who had completed their secondary school education left for Nairobi to look for menial jobs.Little did the family anticipate yet another death of one of them.On April 15 this year, death struck the home once more when her last-born son, Kennedy, 22, died after being involved in a hit-and-run road accident on Mombasa road, at the Flyover adjacent to the Ole Sereni Hotel.According to the distraught woman, police at Industrial Area Police Station said the deceased was hit by a vehicle on the Flyover at Ole Sereni Hotel, along Mombasa road, and he fell on the road before being run over by three other vehicles. We are told that his body was collected close to three kilometres away after being dragged by the third vehicle,” said Chesaro.“It was so hard for me after receiving news of his death, and the circumstances under which he died. He could not be reached by phone for several days only for his mutilated body to be found at the City Mortuary,” she said.The deceased worked a night shift and was heading to his house in South B at 5 am when he met his untimely death.“It was so burdening for us to ferry his body from Nairobi to the village, but through the locals, friends, and relatives, we managed to bury him. However, we are still wondering why the police have not arrested anyone in connection to his death. They claim it has been difficult to trace who knocked him. I thought there were CCTV cameras along that road,” wondered the mother of five.

He had successfully applied for a passport while working in Nairobi. He was also assisting me to pay the fees of the three children left behind by his elder brother,” she said.“I am just appealing for whoever ran over my son along that road on that particular morning to just come out and seek forgiveness. Just report at the Industrial Area Police Station and they will get in touch with me.  My aim is not to sue them but I just want closure and peace in my heart because his demise has hit me so hard. He died a very painful death which disturbs me to date,” she said.

Her son, Caliph Yator, is almost sinking into depression following the devastating deaths in the family.“When I see the three graves in our home and remember how my younger sibling, Kennedy’s mutilated body lay cold at the city mortuary, I feel so frustrated. Sadly, police are yet to unravel whoever hit him. We just need justice because losing a father and two brothers in such a short period, under mysterious circumstances is so devastating,” he said.An area elder, Eliud Chesire, has also appealed to the State to help the family unravel the cause of the three deaths that have shocked locals in the region.“We need to know the truth about what killed them. This family has a lot of burden because all the three who died were the breadwinners. The first-born son, who died in 2019, left behind three children who are now under the care of their grandmother. It is so devastating, to say the least,” said Mr Chesire.For the mother, unravelling the causes of the deaths will give her closure, she says.“I have lost three people who all died under mysterious circumstances and they have not gotten justice. I just appeal to be assisted to know what caused their deaths because I have a lot of unanswered questions,” she appealed.[email protected]

Michael Karanga: From matatu tout to Kenya’s top amateur golfer,"As it was said, every dream is truly valid.

Kiambu Golf Club’s Michael Karanga walked away from the matatu industry, where he was a tout, to become not only Kenya’s number one amateur golfer but also among the top 100 golfers in the world.

Born on January 24, 1995, in Ndumberi, Kiambu County, Karanga went to primary school at Karunga Primary School from 2001 to 2009 in the Ndumberi area.

It was while in primary school he was introduced to the game of golf as one of the youngsters on the junior programme at Ndumberi Golf Club in 2006.

“I was not keen on golf though and this is one of the reasons I even dropped the golfing idea as my mind was fixed on the matatus where I found those makangas (touts) really funny and very interesting.

“I dropped out of high school to engage full-time being a matatu tout because I wanted to make money for my survival,” added Karanga.

However, his decision did not please his grandfather from his mother’s side, Michael Karanga Mwaura, a retired Professional golfer.

“My grandfather, “MK” as he is popularly known, managed to convince me to leave the matatu idea, hence in 2011, I started golf seriously at Ndumberi Golf Club, where I was eventually given a handicap of 10 in 2012.

“I really thank and appreciate “MK” for the decision he took because it opened my mind and I could see that I had taken the wrong decision earlier,” said Karanga in an exclusive interview with Nation Sport.

In 2013, Karanga was taken up by Njogu wa Njoroge to Kiambu Golf Club, where he and other juniors were allowed to play only in the league matches for the club.

“I started serious golf during the 2018 season when Kiambu Golf Club supported me to play in the “Golfer of the Year” tournament, now the Kenya Amateur Golf Championship (KAGC) Series. I featured in five tournaments namely Sigona Bowl at Sigona, Mount Kenya Championship in Nyeri, Muthaiga Open, Windsor Classic and Winston Churchill Cup at Thika Sports Club,” he narrates.

Karanga says he missed the cut at Sigona and Nyeri but managed to make the cut at Muthaiga, Windsor Classic and Winston Churchill.

“I was excited about cutting those events and started practising seriously. I didn’t play that much in 2019, but prepared well for the 2020 season, where I won both Sigona and Mount Kenya Championship.

“However, the remaining events were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.”

When golf activities were allowed to resume in 2021, Karanga went all out to win the Order of Merit title.

“I cherished the idea of becoming Kenya’s number one amateur player, so I played six tournaments and won all and led until Nyali’s Adel Balala came firing and won the series and I finished second. I was very disappointed with the idea of having been beaten, so in 2022, I played only four tournaments.”

His breakthrough, however, came in 2023 when a friend, George Mburu, popularly known as “The Mburu”, encouraged and motivated him, a motivation that saw him win 13 tournaments out of the 17 events he played, a record in Kenya.

“I was not just happy because I had broken pro Kopan Timbe’s 12 wins out of 15 tournaments, but I won all those events on under-par scores and in some of them, like Sigona, Mombasa, and Kiambu, I managed to set new course records.”

Karanga said becoming Kenya’s number one amateur golfer and being ranked below 100 out of 70,000 players by the World Amateur Rankings made him realise that he had made a good decision to drop the “Makanga’’ issue and chose golf instead.

“My best performance in 2023 made me receive several invitations to play in international tournaments like the British Amateur Championship, where I managed to finish in 279, Egypt where I finished fourth and the Western Open in Cape Town, South Africa, where I was fifth, and in the All Africa Open Championship where I finished 10th.

“I played in Ghana, where I won that country’s amateur open, and finished third in Jordan Open early this year’’.

Karanga said although he started this year’s 2024 season poorly, he is still going for the KAGC order of Merit title at the end of the season.

“I have so far played in the Sigona Bowl where I finished second, missed cut at Muthaiga, then came second and fourth at Windsor and Winston Churchill. I think I was more focused and encouraging Elvis Muigua who I mentored. I am actually happy as he won four tournaments.”

He says playing in international events helped his World Amateur Rankings go below 100 because they offer more points depending on how you play.

“I will play in the British Amateur Championship, then wait for the Asian Tour event at Karen.

“Locally I still believe I can finish top again at the end of the season. I am very happy that I have just retained the Coronation trophy by a good score of eight under par 211.

“I still believe I would have finished even better and probably break the course record set in 2004 by the late James Lorum if the greens were not so hard.

“All said and done, I owe my success in this game of golf to my grandfather “MK” Mwaura and my sponsors Betika who have supported me for two years.”

Karanga says the game of golf can take one to many places as long as one is hard-working and disciplined.

“We have supported Muigua who is playing well at the moment. He is playing good golf at the moment I believe he will go very far in this game.”

Besides playing top-class golf, Karanga is also a businessman.

“I have invested in some business’,” he says, although not willing to disclose the kind of business he is involved with.

In addition, last year, he set up the Michael Karanga Foundation in Ndumberi, where he is mentoring 350 children, mostly from underprivileged families.

“Currently, 30 of them have handicaps, and I am very happy the legendary lady golfer Rose Naliaka gave the foundation some playing kit, which will help us.""

“I want those kids to raise and play like me and show Kenyans that golf is not a game for the rich and that anyone can play golf,” said Karanga.

At the foundation’s launch on January 20, this year at the Kiambu Golf Club, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua described Karanga as “a real hustler.”

“Ndumberi has a history of nurturing youngsters to play the game of golf among other sports activities and I must congratulate Michael Karanga for having thought of mobilising the youth in Ndumberi to play the game of golf which has seen Karanga himself rise to be the top golfer in the country,” DP Gachagua said.

“We will, therefore, support the Michael Karanga Foundation and Karanga himself in his efforts to improve his career.”

Meanwhile, just last weekend, Karanga kept the fire burning when he produced an excellent round of six under par 67 in the final round of the 2024 Coronation Trophy Golf Tournament to retain his title with an all-around total of eight under 211 gross at the par 73 Nakuru Golf Club.

Karanga, who led from start to finish, birdied the second and third holes before crossing to the back nine.

He then managed to pick two birdies at the sixth and eighth before dropping a shot at the par-four 10th, after a brilliant driver to 50 off the green.

But that did not discourage him as he later birded the 12th, eagled the 16th and wound up the round with a birdie at the 18th, to beat the long hitter Daniel Kirangu of Muthaiga by 11 shots.

“It’s so great retaining this title after starting the season badly. I must say the course save for the greens which were hard, was playing and I must congratulate the club management for presenting a good course,” the victorious Karanga said at the weekend.

“I will miss the next event, the Ruiru Open because I would like to travel to Europe to play in the British Amateur Championship,” said Karanga.

“I will try and defend a number of those events in won last,” said the Betika-sponsored player, who was assisted by another golfer, Simon Karari, as his caddie.

“Karari helped a lot with the lines, and I thank him for everything,” Karanga appreciated.

New X adult content policy risks collision with governments,"Elon Musk-owned social media giant X has updated its user policy to allow for the sharing and distribution of adult content in a popularity strategy that is set to place it on a collision course with global authorities, including the Kenyan government.

In the platform update, X said users will be allowed to share consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behaviour, so long as it is properly labelled and not prominently displayed in highly visible places such as profile photos or banners.

“We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression,” reads the text in part.

“We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality.”

The platform defines adult content as consensually produced and distributed material that depicts adult nudity or sexual behaviour that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal, including AI-generated, photographic, or animated content.

“Users under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile cannot click to view marked content,” says X.

In Kenya, the policy is poised to open a battlefront with local authorities who have recently embarked on an aggressive drive to weed out moral subversion spearheaded by social apps, which is increasingly rampant among the youthful population.

Social media analyst Egline Samoei interprets the move as a marking strategy which is part of a wider scheme geared towards an ultimate introduction of a paywall, but is quick to note that the approach could flop especially in conservative markets like Kenya’s.

Read: Elon Musk’s X posting fee plan causes jitters in Kenya

“The new policy update is a marketing strategy by X and Elon Musk to tap into generators who create adult content that has been banned from other platforms. The end goal could be to put content in a paywall and monetise,” states Ms Samoei.

“But again if you look at it, the policy portends risks to users and brands who value online safety. This could spark negative reactions among users and regulators when finally rolled out.”

In recent months, a nationwide debate regarding a possible ban on local usage of the popular short-form video-sharing app TikTok dominated policy and expert conversations over the display of sexually explicit content among other concerns, prompting the platform’s global CEO Shou Zi Chew to seek virtual audience with President William Ruto.

Shortly after the meeting held in August last year, a State House dispatch indicated that Mr Chew had agreed to work with Kenya in reviewing and monitoring its content as concerns heated up against runaway moral breakdown among users.

Weeks before the meeting, a Kenyan named Bob Ndolo had petitioned Parliament to effect a total ban on TikTok arguing that the explicit content displayed on the platform promoted sexual violence, hate speech, and vulgarity thereby undermining the country’s moral fabric.

"Preserve the environment, NMG chief urges Kenyans","The Nation Media Group (NMG) will continue to sensitise Kenyans on the need to preserve the environment, Board Chairman Wilfred Kiboro said on Wednesday.

He said that it is only through restoring and protecting the environment that the country can avert destruction and loss of lives.

“Let the destruction and loss of life we experienced recently galvanise us to respect our environment by restoring and protecting it. There is a need to forge strong partnerships, to plant and grow trees, check soil erosion, mentor and sensitise our youth,” he said in a statement read by Green Blue Foundation Africa, Project Manager Jackson Mwangi.

Dr Kiboro praised the partnership between NMG, Family Bank Foundation and Nairobi Institute of Technology and encouraged other stakeholders to take environmental matters seriously.

During a tree planting initiative at Kona Baridi in Kajiado County, participants from the three organisations planted 1,000 seedlings.

Forest Ecosystem Restoration project

With the planting of seedlings, the collective responsibility to nurture them into maturity became abundantly clear.

Just a few years ago, the landscape at Kona Baridi was marred by gullies encircling the plains. However, thanks to the ongoing project, the area now boasts pristine conditions.

The event was part of the Forest Ecosystem Restoration project, a model endeavour that took root in 2022.

The project targets to restore 240 acres of land within the Ngong Hills Forest.

Family Bank Foundation’s Executive Director Mr John Waimiri, said approximately 70 acres of land have been covered by the combined efforts of Family Bank, NMG, and Green Blue Foundation Africa.

“Planting trees is one thing, but watering them and nurturing them for three years ensures their survival,” he said.

World Environment Day

In Embu, Environment Cabinet Secretary Soipan Tuya led the country in marking World Environment Day celebrations.

“We want to ensure that our efforts are not negated by allowing the continued destruction of the little that is left of our forests and protected areas,” she said.

Speaking at the University of Embu, Ms Tuya sounded the alarm over illegal occupation of forests, riparian and swamp land. The CS told those illegally occupying riparian land, forests and wetlands to heed government calls and vacate.

Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire called on Kenyans to emulate the late Professor Wangari Mathaai and restore the environment.

Ms Mbarire said Prof Mathaai was a great inspiration and everyone should be in the forefront in making the environment better.

The University of Embu Vice Chancellor Prof Daniel Mugendi said they have partnered with the National Environment Management Authority to conserve Kiambuthi wetland.

Poll: Majority of Kenyans opposed to Finance Bill 2024,"Eight out of 10 Kenyans are opposed to the introduction of new taxes on bread, cooking oil, financial services, motor vehicles and a new levy on environmentally unfriendly products, a new opinion poll has shown.



Additionally, 63 percent of Kenyans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction citing the skyrocketing cost of living (45 percent) and unemployment that has left many families unable to meet their daily needs.

According to the opinion poll conducted by Infotrak Research firm between May 25 and May 29 2024, 77 per cent of Kenyans said the Finance Bill 2024 will not have a positive impact on the economy with a paltry 13 per cent of those interviewed arguing that it will have a positive impact.

An overwhelming 87 per cent of Kenyans are opposed to the introduction of a 16 per cent VAT on bread while 86 per cent are opposed to the introduction of VAT services on financial transactions such as M-PESA.

Other taxes in the Finance Bill that Kenyans rejected include the introduction tax of 2.5 per cent of the value of the motor vehicle (81 per cent), an additional levy on unfriendly products (83 per cent) and a proposal to exempt the disclosure of personal data by data controllers to the taxman (83 per cent).

Mr Johvine Wanyingo, Infotrak Research Manager on Thursday said that out of the 1,700 respondents interviewed, only 54 per cent of them were aware of the existence of the Finance Bill 2024 with 46 per cent of them indicating they were not aware of the bill.

The Central Region leads at 62 per cent while Eastern at 41 per cent was the lowest in terms of awareness.

“There is more that still needs to be done to ensure that Kenyans are aware of the Finance Bill. We have also seen that it is during President William Ruto administration that the number of Kenyans aware about the impact of the bill has increased particularly about the impact it has on their lives and the economy,” Mr Wanyingo said.

Read: Major issues in Ruto’s Finance Bill 2024 and the pain points

Mr Wanyingo also said that a comparison to previous opinion polls conducted in 2023 reveals that high taxes imposed by the government and skyrocketing cost of living have been cited by respondents as a reason for the country’s wrong trajectory.

“Over the past year, Kenyans have consistently expressed growing dissatisfaction with the respondents who believed the country was heading in the wrong direction standing at 62 per cent and 53 per cent respectively. In comparison with the polls we did on August/September 2023 and February 2023, the notable issues leading to the negative response are the high cost of living (89 per cent) for August/September polls and high taxes,” he added.

In terms of regions that believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, Nairobi accounted for 74 per cent, followed by Eastern 69 per cent and Nyanza 68 per cent. Only 19 per cent of Kenyans believe the country is headed in the right direction with Rift Valley and North Eastern leading at 23 per cent and 20 per cent.

On gender, 32 per cent of male adults identified unemployment as a key concern, while the female gender at (29 per cent) also indicated unemployment as a significant issue.

The research used quantitative interviews with 1,700 respondents spread across all 47 counties and eight regions in the country with a 95 per cent degree of confidence.

MPs give Judiciary Sh1.2bn to buy city office block,"Lawmakers have allocated Sh1.2 billion to the Judiciary for the purchase of a building in Upper Hill in a bid to ease pressure for office space and judge chambers following an increased number of judges.

This is part of a Sh3.22 billion budget increase for the Judiciary by the National Assembly’s Budget and Appropriations Committee (BAC), which is chaired by Kiharu Member of Parliament (MP) Ndindi Nyoro.

Read: President Ruto appoints 20 new High Court judges

The extra allocation has raised the Judiciary’s budget for the financial year 2024/25 to Sh23.73 billion.

“Additional Sh1.2 billion (development) for purchase of Madison House (office),” said the committee in its report to the House.

The Judiciary has been injected with a further Sh200 million for the settlement of outstanding court arbitration at the Lodwar Law Courts, Sh400 for refurbishment of the Supreme Court and Sh300 million for leasing motor vehicles.

MPs have also given the third arm of government an additional Sh300 million for mortgage, Sh320 million for the facilitation of 36 new judges, Sh200 for operationalisation of small claims courts and Sh300 million for digital strategy and automation.



Madison Insurance House is located next to Milimani Commercial Courts.

In 2022, Madison Life Assurance Kenya Limited, which owns the building, revealed it was selling properties worth Sh8 billion to restructure its balance sheet and boost capital.

The insurance firm is said to have approached the Judiciary with the offer to sell the building.

The budgeted purchase comes four years after the National Treasury allocated Sh1.2 billion to the Judiciary to purchase a property in Muthaiga.

The Muthaiga property comprises buildings, a water reservoir, a swimming pool and other developments and sits on 15.45 acres of land along Coffee Garden Road, off Kiambu Road.

The property was owned by the State-owned Kenya Post Office Savings Bank (Postbank) and housed the Judiciary Training Institute (JTI).

While Postbank would later reveal that it had managed to sell off the property to another government agency for a sum of Sh1.5 billion, it failed to disclose if the buyer was the Judiciary.

This comes even as the Judiciary says that its funding from the exchequer is still less than half of its annual resource requirements, leading to a cash crunch that has derailed the effective administration of justice.

The funding shortfall, the Judiciary says, has affected the construction of offices and courts, facilitation of benches and service weeks, operationalisation of the small claims courts and sustenance of the pro bono scheme.

“This shortfall has grossly affected the implementation of critical programmes such as operationalisation of new courts. Out of 22 court stations gazette in the last MTEF (medium term expenditure frameworks), only six have been operationalised to date,” it said.

Teacher takes own life after ‘losing bet’,"A teacher at Nyamira Boys High School has allegedly died by suicide after losing a bet on an online casino.

He lost the bet in a gambling game that features a simple yet captivating concept, where players place bets and watch as a multiplier increases over time.

The objective is to cash out at the right moment before the multiplier crashes, potentially resulting in a loss of the bet.

The game offers players a thrilling experience based on a Random Number Generator (RNG).

According to Nyamira Township Assistant Chief Johnson Manyara the deceased, identified as Kelvin Omwenga, took his life inside his rental house on Wednesday night.

The administrator said that the teacher had lost up to Sh50,000 in his last game.

“I was informed by members of the public about a teacher who had allegedly ended his life by suicide; I immediately proceeded to his house where I found his lifeless body,” Mr Manyara said.

“His wife had travelled upcountry after delivery. They had also been informed that his parents were ailing and the deceased told his wife to go and see how they were fairing,” the administrator said.

Nyamira Boys Principal George Onkundi said they were shocked to learn of Mr Omwenga’s death.

The principal said the deceased was employed by the school’s board of managers (BOM) and he had been at Nyamira Boys for four years.

“He was teaching Mathematics and Chemistry. He had stayed with us for four years. He did not report to work on Wednesday. His death has shocked us,” Mr Onkundi said.

He added that the deceased never expressed any signs of distress, but confirmed he used to borrow money from his colleagues.

“He had mentioned that there were some issues that were bothering him at home. He would often receive financial help from teachers but he was not under pressure to clear his debts,” Mr Onkundi said.

Another teacher at the school, Pethuel Mong’are, said the late teacher used to borrow money from him quite often with the promise that he would repay “soon”.

“The last time I talked to him was on Tuesday and I am equally shocked about his demise.”

Career lessons we can learn from football,"The English Premier League is without a doubt one of the most followed leagues in the country. Kenyan diehards can name the starting lineup of their favourite teams, but they can’t do the same for their local teams, let alone the national team, Harambee Stars. Did you know we can learn some career lessons from football?

Promotion and relegationTeams that get promoted from the Championship League to the EPL exhibit so much pomp and fanfare. The opposite is true when the three bottom teams are demoted. The promoted teams often go on a shopping spree, buying the best talents to boost their squads ahead of the new season, while demoted ones dispense with some players whom they feel didn't do much for the team. Players that were instrumental in helping the team gain promotion could end up being overlooked, benched, sold or loaned to other clubs.

In this same way, a new hire can end up shining and going up the career ladder in the organisation ahead of seasoned ones who have stagnated. It is not unusual for your job description to be narrowed as a new employee takes over some of them, even though you were once a dependable cog in the wheels of the organisation. It is similar to a team captain being stripped of the captain’s badge and being reduced to a mere player. Anticipate such scenarios and prepare accordingly for them.

When burnout sets inIn football, sometimes the mercurial players that were previously running rings around the opponents’ defense and scoring freely begin to fade both in form and speed, and struggle to find the back of the net. Eventually they're dropped from the starting lineup, and are only brought in as substitutes in the dying minutes of a game. It is the same at the workplace. When burnout sets in, even talented employees may experience a dip in productivity, yet you may find a boss demanding more from such an employee without being empathetic of their situation. Don’t yield to such a boss. Burnout can negatively impact your health and you don’t want to crash.

Taking blame when one takes praisesAssume the team is leading against an opponent by a solitary goal and there are few minutes of regular play time left. A melee erupts at the goalmouth and a player inadvertently scores an own goal, thereby handing the opponent a reprieve. Then in extra time, the opponent scores the winning goal, and defeats your team when you had home advantage. As the losing players walk towards the tunnel with crestfallen faces, fans are booing and abusing the one who scored an own goal. In the post-match presser, the player owns up to the mistake, even though your team has been knocked out of the tournament. This is a picture of a good employee.

There are some people, especially bosses, who will insist on things to be done in a specific way, and will not take blame if the outcome is not desirable. Instead, they will lay the blame on others. A good boss allows employees to be innovative instead of asking them to do things the conventional way.

"Limit mini-budgets to one in financial year, Treasury told","National Assembly leader of the majority, Kimani Ichung’wah, has accused the National Treasury of disrupting the country’s development agenda with numerous reviews of the annual budget.

The lawmaker took issue with the introduction of many supplementary budgets that delay the implementation of projects.

Mr Ichung’wah, the Kikuyu MP, says that this exposes the government to fiscal indiscipline despite promises of consolidation and effective utilisation of public resources to foster the country’s commitment to sustainable development initiatives.

Mr Ichung’wah berated the National Treasury on the day the National Assembly approved the supplementary budget II for the 2023/24 financial year, reducing the government’s expenditure plans by Sh24.2 billion, with the development budget the most affected.

Mr Ichung’wah made his case unequivocal as the Budget and Appropriations Committee (BAC), in its report on the supplementary budget II to the National Assembly, questioned some of the government’s expenditures, noting that they do not merit the requirements of Article 223 of the constitution.

Mr Ichung’wah told the National Treasury that it is wrong to continue revising the country’s budgets, noting that fiscal management is critical to the prudent use of “the limited” public funds.

""The recurrent practice of revising budgets multiple times within a single financial year is not conducive to a sound fiscal management regime of a country,"" said Mr Ichung’wah.

""It reflects a lack of preparedness in our budgeting processes and introduces uncertainties in resource allocation for crucial programs.""

The supplementary budget increased the recurrent budget for the current financial year by Sh51.11 billion as it reduced the development budget by Sh75.3 billion, with BAC projecting increasing pending bills.

“This signals a delay or halt in numerous projects resulting in escalated project costs owing to inevitable delays. Such postponement jeopardizes the timely achievement of crucial development milestones.”

“The deferment of projects due to funding constraints not only leads to higher costs in the long run but also risks cost overruns as material and labour prices tend to escalate during prolonged delays,” the BAC report states.

Article 223 of the constitution allows the national government to spend money not appropriated by parliament if the amount appropriated for any purpose is insufficient or if a need has arisen for expenditure for a purpose for which no amount has been appropriated.

In case money has been withdrawn from the public coffers without the authority of the MPs, the Article requires the National Treasury to report to the National Assembly within two months of the last withdrawal.

Mr Ichung’wah emphasised the assembly's long standing plea to limit supplementary budgets to one per financial year, as he stressed the disruptive nature of multiple revisions, noting their adverse effects on budgetary predictability and operational certainty within government agencies.

The Kikuyu MP expressed his reservations amid concerns over the ripple effects of budgetary fluctuations on governmental agencies tasked with program implementation as fears abound that the unpredictability “stemming” from frequent revisions “creates challenges in resource planning and undermines the efficiency of service delivery initiatives.”

""I want to re-emphasise the need for prudent use of public resources. This House has called on the National Treasury to limit supplementary budgets to at least one in a financial year so that whatever you plan from your BPS right to the annual estimates, you can only revise it once,"" notes Mr Ichung’wah.

According to Mr Ichung’wah, “having to do budgetary revisions twice, thrice a year, is not very good budgetary practice as it speaks volumes to our preparedness level when we are preparing our budgets.”

In a way, the Kikuyu MP said, it creates uncertainty with implementing agencies in government as to whether you will have adequate resources to implement all the programmes budgeted for you within a certain financial year.

The budget committee, chaired by Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, also questioned the increased expenditure on non-core areas.

“The committee noted that there is a tendency to revise recurrent expenditure upwards during the supplementary budget process despite the national government’s commitment to a fiscal consolidation path. Most recurrent spending does not typically constitute an emergency and can be deferred to the following financial year,” the committee’s report reads.

Although Article 223 does not allow the introduction of new projects in supplementary budgets, the National Treasury went against this.

The committee cited the Sh2 billion Kenya Green Resilient Expansion of Energy project and Sh100 million consultative services for the South Lokichar Oil Field Development plan as some of the new projects sneaked into the budget by the National Treasury.

There is also the Sh2 billion Konza and Smart City facility, Sh700 million horizontal infrastructure development, the Sh732 million installation and commissioning of Eldoret Napal fibre optic and the Sh400 million digital economy acceleration project.

The government has had challenges with revenue collection as the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) projects missed revenue targets of up to Sh350 billion in the current financial year.

The net effect of missed revenue targets has already seen the National Treasury reduce the Sh4.2 trillion budget as contained in the Budget Policy Statement (BPS), as approved by the National Assembly, to Sh3.9 trillion.

With these revenue-raising challenges, Mr Ichung’wah notes “it is only fair that the National Treasury ensures that the revenues we project are as realistic as possible and as close to what the reality is as possible.”

Addressing the underlying revenue challenges, Mr Ichung’wah challenged the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to enhance revenue collection guided by realistic revenue projections “aligned with prevailing economic realities to mitigate the necessity for recurrent budgetary adjustments.”

""Effective revenue mobilisation is paramount to maintaining fiscal stability,"" Mr Ichungwah added.

""It is incumbent upon the Kenya Revenue Authority to bolster its efforts in revenue collection to mitigate the reliance on supplementary budgets for fiscal adjustments.""

Senate bill seeks higher threshold for impeaching CECs,"Impeaching County Executive Committee (CEC) members will soon become a Herculean task for Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) if a new bill before the Senate becomes law.

The County Governments (Amendment) Bill, 2023, sponsored by Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei, seeks to tighten the threshold for the ouster of senior county officials.

CECs head various county executive dockets responsible for devolved functions as set out in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.

The bill aims to protect these officials from the wrath of ward representatives, who have been accused of introducing impeachment motions based on ""political witch hunt and flimsy grounds"" due to the current low threshold for such actions.

Section 40 of the County Governments Act allows a CEC member to be impeached by a vote of one-third of the Members of the County Assembly (MCAs).

The proposed amendment to Section 40 of the County Governments Act would increase the voting threshold in a County Assembly for the removal of an executive, who is the equivalent of cabinet secretaries in the national government, to two-thirds.

The bill is already in the Senate and the National Assembly for its first reading.

""This bill proposes to enhance the threshold of voting in a county assembly for the removal of a member of a county executive committee. It seeks to increase the threshold to two-thirds. Currently, Section 40 of the County Governments Act allows a CEC member to be removed by a vote of one-third of the MCAs),"" reads part of the bill.

Under the proposed law, at least two-thirds of county assembly members will need to vote in favour of an impeachment motion to remove a CEC member.

The bill highlights the significant consequences of removing a CEC member and argues that the current threshold is too low.

Several CECs have faced impeachment by MCAs since the advent of devolution.

Recent instances include the failed ouster of Nakuru County Secretary Dr Samuel Mwaura, who sits in the Cabinet.

The motion against Dr Mwaura was sponsored by Menengai ward MCA Wilson Mwangi and supported by others, alleging his disregard for the assembly and involvement in the Nakuru War Memorial takeover saga.

The accusations included gross violation of various laws, including the County Administration Act, Leadership and Integrity Act, and County Assembly Powers and Privileges Act, as well as gross misconduct related to an alleged sponsorship of thugs to invade a hospital and transfer patients.

On October 25, 2023, Baringo MCAs attempted to remove a Roads CEC for keeping untrimmed beards.

The motion moved by Kisanana Ward MCA Jacob Cheboiwo argued that the executive had failed to maintain appropriate standards of dress and personal hygiene and had conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of a public office holder.

The motion failed after a vote presided over by Speaker Vincent Kemboi, where it garnered 18 votes against 22 with one abstention.

In February 2023, Nyamira MCAs impeached Finance Executive Emily Ongaga over accusations of gross misconduct and abuse of office, with 33 out of 35 MCAs present supporting the motion.

Similarly, a year earlier, Siaya County Assembly members successfully impeached Water CEC Caroline Onyango, with 39 out of 42 MCAs present voting for her removal.

To initiate the removal process, an MCA must propose a motion supported by at least one-third of all members requiring the governor to dismiss the CEC.

Grounds for removal include gross violation of the Constitution or any other law, incompetence, abuse of office, gross misconduct, or conviction of an offence punishable by imprisonment for at least six months.

An MCA seeking to sponsor an impeachment motion must secure the signatures of at least one-third of the county assembly members. Once the motion is filed, a special committee of five members is set up to investigate the charges within 10 days.

The CEC has the right to appear and be represented before the committee. If the committee finds the allegations unsubstantiated, no further action is taken.

However, if the allegations are substantiated, the county assembly votes on the resolution. Currently, only one-third of the members need to support the motion for it to proceed, but the new proposal would require the support of two-thirds of the members.

If the MCAs vote in favour of the impeachment motion under the new threshold, the Speaker would promptly deliver the resolution to the governor to dismiss the CEC.

Revealed: How police tracked suspected killer of Naivasha supermarket manager,"On the morning of May 22, staff at the Chandarana Foodplus supermarket in Buffalo Mall, Naivasha arrived to find the shop closed.

This was highly unusual as their manager, Hassan Abdullatif Salim, was known for his punctuality.

As time went by with no sign of activity, concern began to spread among the staff and several calls to Mr Salim went unanswered, escalating their worries. Some supervisors decided to check on him at his house.

What they found there left them in a state of shock and fear, as there were blood stains near the door, a sign that something terribly wrong had happened, while the house remained locked.

This disturbing discovery suggested a gruesome fate for their boss and marked the beginning of a chilling investigation.

Upon entering the flat, police and supermarket staff found Salim's body with three deep stab wounds to the head.

The Nation can reveal how 25-year-old Joseph Mungai Wanjira, the prime suspect in the murder, was arrested on Wednesday through the triangulation of a mobile phone.

According to Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss Mohamed Amin, the suspect was tracked down and arrested at his mobile phone repair shop in Naivasha town at 1pm on Wednesday after days of painstaking search.

He was later found with household items belonging to the slain supermarket manager.

""Intelligence analysis and CCTV footage revealed the prime suspect in the murder of the Naivasha supermarket manager, in whose possession were found most of the items stolen from the deceased's house, including a TV set, a 6kg Pro Gas, a Samsung tablet, a NASA branded hoodie and a blood-stained bag,"" Mr Amin said in a statement.

""After a brief interrogation, the suspect led detectives to the scene of the crime (the deceased's house) where they recovered two weapons - a kitchen knife and a piece of wood - believed to have been used in the cold-blooded murder,"" he added.

The suspect was caught on CCTV leaving the deceased's home with some of the suspected stolen items.

""An analysis of the CCTV footage documenting the robbery incident helped in the pursuit and eventual arrest of the suspect.Detectives had collected crucial evidence from the crime scene, including CCTV footage, which helped in the manhunt for the suspect,"" Mr Amin further revealed.

The CCTV footage, dated May 22 and seen by the Nation, showed the suspect leaving Salim's house while carrying some of the stolen items from the deceased's house, including a television set and a 6kg propane cylinder, before boarding a motorbike that was on standby.

Detectives are now tracking the boda boda rider who they believe took him to and from the scene of the murder.

A post-mortem was conducted on Salim's body in Naivasha before it was transferred to Mombasa.

On Wednesday evening, Naivasha Sub-County Police Commander Stephen Kirui revealed that after the murder, the suspect changed his clothes and wore those of the deceased, including the branded hoodie he was caught on CCTV wearing as he fled the scene.

New details have also emerged, revealing that the suspect and the victim were known to each other.

""During the investigation, a neighbour volunteered information that he (the suspect) used to hang out with the deceased and after committing the crime, he changed his clothes and wore the deceased's clothes. His clothes were also stained with blood,"" Mr Kirui revealed.

Neighbours and friends, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, revealed that the two were close friends who could often be found at entertainment venues and eateries in Naivasha town.

The suspect is now being held at Naivasha Police Station awaiting court proceedings.

Preliminary investigations suggest that the victim was preparing for bed or already asleep when he was attacked.

The apartment complex, which houses both tenants and short-term visitors, requires tenants to have keys to enter, raising questions as to how the suspect gained access to the premises.

"Mr President, Kenyan sport deserves much better from you","Almost two weeks have passed since President William Ruto returned to the country following a “successful” State visit to the United States of America, and the man is still defending himself.

From the millions of taxpayers’ money he spent flying himself and his entourage First Class to the Land of Opportunities, from his decision to use a private jet to and from America at a time when Kenyans are choking from high taxation and national debt, and from his remarks that the national courier, Kenya Airways, is just too expensive.

One thing I haven’t heard him defend is the silence that Kenyan sports lovers had to endure upon finding out that there was nothing in the visit for us. The only thing I saw that looked like sports was a photo of Ruto dwarfed by a towering NBA legend, Shaquille O’Neal, during his stop in Atlanta.

I hoped there would be news of a partnership, or at least an exchange programme that could benefit the basketball fraternity in Kenya, but there was nothing more to the picture. I saw popular sports managers like Masai Ujiri and others on the guest list to meet the President, but there were no discussions centred on Kenyan sports. Perhaps the thinking is that there is nothing that Kenya, a football-mad country, could learn from America, a country so obsessed with their distinct version of football. Yes, they don’t give much thought to soccer, which is what they call our brand of football, but is there nothing we could squeeze out of the visit to benefit our struggling sports industry?Surely, a conversation about upgrading our sports infrastructure would have been relevant. In Kenya, no stadium can host any match worth talking about.

Kasarani Stadium, our crown jewel for more than six decades, is closed for renovations (for the umpteenth time) ahead of the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations tournament, which Kenya will host jointly with Uganda and Tanzania. The same goes for Nyayo National Stadium, which is also closed. Both these stadiums were renovated less than three years ago, and by the end, they still lacked key facilities, including floodlights, without which they fall short of hosting high-profile games. It should shock and anger every Kenyan citizen that Harambee Stars will “host” their Fifa World Cup qualifying matches against African champions Cote d'Ivoire and Burundi in Malawi because we lack a venue to host such a match. But it doesn’t anger us enough, perhaps because we don’t think about it enough.

The lack of mention of sports throughout the State Visit shows the kind of condescension with which Kenyan sport is viewed, and this, coming from the top leadership, says it all. That sports discussions are hardly mainstream or given the weight they deserve is a disservice to all sportsmen and women who engage in so much marathon running, hurdles jumping, knee-sliding and corner-flag slapping every week, and the result is an industry experiencing stunted growth. One hopes that in Ruto’s next State visit, which he will hopefully not have to hire a private jet, there will be at least some serious talk about the state of Kenyan sports.

"All about Endometriosis, the beast Njambi Koikai battled","Njambi Koikai's life story, both online and offline, was woven with a singular thread: her unwavering battle against endometriosis.

After a gruelling fight that spanned over a decade, the former radio host passed away on Monday.

Koikai bravely endured more than 20 surgeries to manage the pain, and became a vocal advocate for endometriosis awareness.

Her passing leaves a void, but also a burning desire to learn more about endometriosis.

Dr Steve Mutiso, an obstetrician-gynaecologist, who specialises in minimal access surgery at The Aga Khan University Hospital, explains.

What is endometriosis?

Let’s start with the basics. The uterus is a structure in a female’s body that is designed for carrying a baby, and the womb has layers that serve different purposes.

The innermost layer is called the endometrial lining, and this is the layer that comes out every month as menstrual period— a shedding of that inner lining of the womb.

Endometriosis, therefore, is the presence of the lining of the womb, which is called the endometrium, at a site that is not within the womb.

And it can be anywhere.

For instance, on top of the womb, on the ovaries, inside the tummy, and even in distant sites such as the lungs and the brain.

Is it possible for one to know that they have endometriosis even before they visit a health facility?

To answer that question, I'll go back to what this disease is.

So, at the point when a woman is shedding off that lining, the signal usually doesn't come from the womb.

It comes from other centres to tell the womb this is not conceived, and there is need to shed off this lining inside the womb to prepare for the next cycle.

When you have endometriosis, it means all those other abnormal sites that have that lining of the womb will also get the signal to be shed off and bleed.

But because they're in a site that is not where they were designed to be in, they cause a lot of intense reaction around that site.

And this intense reaction initially is manifested as period pain that is out of proportion of what we expect.

Period pain shouldn't limit you from doing your daily activities. Anything that's outside that context is not normal period pain.

And any woman who has abnormal period pain should always be thinking, could this be unusual and possibly endometriosis?

When does it occur?

It can occur at the onset of menstruation or even later.

And this is true by the kind of endometriosis patients we see. We have some as young as 13, and as old as 45 to 50 years old.

As this disease develops, the longer it's present, the more intense the symptoms seem to become.

Are there different stages of endometriosis, maybe in terms of pain?

Yes, and it is based on where it originates from and we have four stages.

On the first, you have little or no damage to the structures that it’s on.

As you progress to stage two, three, and four, the damage to the structures becomes more.

The further it is away from the origin of the lining, the higher the staging.

With regards to the pain, it's not related to the extent of the disease. And what I mean by this is that you can have really bad endometriosis, which we call stage four disease, but the pain could be much less than someone who has an early-stage endometriosis.

Could you talk to us about the different diagnostic options available for endometriosis in Kenya, and its prevalence?

Statistics show that one in six to one in 10 women might have some form of endometriosis.

But looking at the bigger context, any woman who comes in with significant period pain and doesn't have a cause on normal ultrasound imaging, most of them might have endometriosis.

There are many ways you can diagnose it. One, and what is usually the first way, is just by the symptoms.

The second way is by imaging, like doing a pelvic ultrasound, whereby we're able to investigate the pelvis from outside.

The only limitation of this imaging is that early in the disease, the damage is so small that you might not be able to see anything on the scans but in the latter stages it could pick it up really well.

The last way we diagnose is by seeing it with our eyes through a form of surgery called laparoscopy— camera surgery that makes tiny cuts in the tummy to look for the endometriosis lesions.

All these three modalities are available in Kenya.

And treatment options?

The best options usually are removal of these abnormal lining bits that are outside the womb, and that involves surgery.

We also have medications that we can give that counteract the hormones in a woman's body that aid in the growth of endometriosis.

The problem with endometriosis is that because this lining is present in a woman's body throughout her life, there is still a chance that it will recur because the genetic problem that is there, causing this disease to form, will still be present in this woman's body throughout her reproductive life.

I always tell my patients once we've diagnosed endometriosis that we are together until the time they finish their reproductive life because they will probably require consistent reviews and reassessments to aid in improving their quality of life.

Are there any new or emerging treatments for endometriosis, whether in Kenya or globally?

Notably there's not much change in terms of the treatment profile.

But there are other drugs coming into the market that actually might postpone the need for surgery, and these are available worldwide, even in Kenya.

Is it preventable, and is it hereditary?

Hereditary? yes, it is.

There are genes that make women predisposed to having endometriosis.

On prevention, it is a difficult question to answer.

What we know with endometriosis is that you can't prevent the disease.

If it's going to come, it's going to come either way but one can be vigilant to the symptoms we've touched on which will aid in earlier diagnosis and prevention of the complications that it can bring.

What would you want women with endometriosis to know?

This is one of the diseases that one can live a normal life with, especially if it's diagnosed at an early stage and they get the correct treatment.

Also, treatment does exist in the country.

The last thing is that having endometriosis should not limit a woman's ability to be the best they can be, you know, socially, professionally, in life, especially, and that actually is usually the aim of treatment— to try and return this woman's life back to normal. I would also urge those experiencing abnormal period pain to get an assessment.

Is there a correlation between endometriosis and infertility?

One of the biggest burdens of concern with endometriosis is its impact on the ability of a woman to conceive.

A good number of women will have lesions of endometriosis on the fallopian tubes, where fertilisation occurs.

And because of the continuous irritation of the disease on these tubes, they might damage the tubes.

Moreover, just the presence of endometriosis lesions around the ovaries and tubes seems to significantly prevent conception even though there may not be any physical damage to these structures.

"Why millions of girls, women continue to suffer from period poverty","Rose Achieng'* is a teenage girl living in the sprawling Kibera slums. She shares with Nation.Africa some of the challenges she faces as an adolescent.

The 16-year-old from Lindi village at the heart of the sprawling Kibera in Nairobi notes lack of sanitary towels as one of the main problems that she encounters every month.

“My mother in many instances lacks the money to buy the sanitary towels for me. I am usually forced to seek assistance from Kirta Touch the Needy, a non-governmental organisation that provides sanitary towels to the needy girls in the slums. Whenever they do not have, I have to look for alternatives, including using old clothes,” she says.

Achieng’s predicament is not isolated. It mirrors those of millions of other girls across the world who are unable to afford menstrual products.

According to the latest survey by UN Women, millions of women and girls worldwide still cannot afford menstrual products or access water and sanitation facilities to manage their menstrual health and hygiene.

The survey lists stigma, high cost of menstrual products, and lack of water and sanitation facilities as some of the drivers of period poverty, which is also perpetuated by stigma and the lack of information and education as many girls and young women lack awareness and are unprepared for their periods.

More than 1.5 billion people still lack basic sanitation services, such as private toilets.

“Menstrual products are prohibitively expensive for millions of people worldwide. Gender-blind policies and tax laws on feminine products – are, in part, to blame, but such policy decisions go together with the stigma and taboo attached to menstruation,” the UN Women Survey reads.

The UN agency notes that at least one in 10 women and girls in rural areas across 12 countries did not have a private place to wash and change during their last periods.

Read: Let’s address period poverty

In Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Madagascar and Zimbabwe, for example, adolescent girls and women in urban areas are more likely to use sanitary pads than those in rural areas, who are more likely to use cloth and sponges.

One in five adolescent girls and women in rural Ethiopia used no materials, compared with 1 in 20 in urban areas, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef data.

In the United States, one in four teens and one in three adults struggle to afford period products, especially teenagers of colour and from lower-income households.

A 2020 survey by Plan International showed that three in 10 girls in the United Kingdom struggle to afford or access menstrual products and more than half of them used toilet paper instead.

In a recent UN Women's report from Gaza, more than 540,000 women and girls of reproductive age lack access to items to support their hygiene, health and dignity.

Read: Period poverty lowering school attendance in Boni

They are resorting to cloth or sponges because they cannot access menstrual products. UN Women estimates that 10 million disposable menstrual pads are needed each month to cover the needs and preserve the dignity of women and girls in Gaza.

The survey indicates that period poverty is also perpetuated by stigma and lack of information and education.

It also finds that policymakers and adults with decision-making power in schools and workplaces also lack comprehensive menstrual education.

From mindless scrolling on Twitter to winning big at the global stage,"By Daniel Apolo

In the vast world of social media and technological advancements, opportunities often come when least expected. For me, Daniel Apolo Ochola, Information Technology student at Mount Kenya University, one such opportunity came as I was scrolling through Twitter one evening.

It was just like any other evening, casually browsing through tweets when a particular post caught my eye. The Huawei Talent ICT Academy competition announcement stood out among the countless tweets, offering tracks in cloud computing, networking, and computing. My curiosity was instantly aroused, so I clicked on the link to learn more.

As I read through the details, it became clear that this competition was something I couldn't miss. With tracks covering the most booming technological shifts, it seemed tailor-made for someone like me who wanted to stay ahead of the curve in the IT industry.

From that moment on, my journey with the Huawei Talent ICT Academy competition began. From August to November 2023, I dedicated myself to self-study, immersing myself in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data.

The preliminary examination in November was the first real test of my knowledge and preparation. Despite the nerves, I performed well enough to advance to the national level.

The national examination in December was intense, but my determination paid off when I secured the second position in the cloud track, out of six talented individuals selected based on merit. This achievement propelled me to the regional finals, where I represented Kenya in the Southern Africa Region.

Training at the Huawei office in Lavington for two months in preparation for the Regional Competition level was a transformative experience. Interacting with professionals in the field not only enhanced my knowledge but also gave me a glimpse into the real-world application of what I had learned.

The journey took an unexpected turn when I found myself forming a team with Ian Omwenga and Mark Omaiko, both from Machakos University, for the regional competition. Little did I know that this collaboration would lead us to clinch the second position out of 13 teams in the region, earning us a spot in the global finals in Shenzhen, China.

Being among the 18 students who represented Kenya at the global finals on May 22, 2024 felt surreal. It was an honour to carry the flag of my country and my region on such a prestigious platform.

The main lessons I drew from the competition at the national and regional levels were perseverance and collaboration. The competition taught me that success is not just about individual brilliance but also about working together as a team.

From a casual Twitter scroll to representing Kenya at the global finals, the journey has been remarkable. The lessons learned, friendships made, and experiences gained along the way have been invaluable.

As the day of the global finals approached, my expectations were high. I anticipated fierce competition from talented individuals worldwide. However, I was confident in our abilities and the skills we had honed throughout the journey. I also looked forward to making friends from different parts of the world.

Traveling to Shenzhen, China for the Huawei ICT Talent Academy global finals was an eye-opening experience. The city's advanced civilization, characterised by its impressive road infrastructure and the disciplined, organised nature of its people, left me in awe. Our visits to Huawei's exhibition halls were particularly inspiring, as we witnessed cutting-edge innovations like self-driving intelligent vehicle systems, generative AI, and advancements in the telecommunications industry, including super 5G technology. These experiences not only broadened my understanding of the latest technological trends but also reinforced my passion for IT.

Moreover, the opportunity to explore Shenzhen and interact with fellow competitors from around the world enriched my cultural perspective. Engaging with peers from Asian countries, South America, China, and fellow African nations such as Nigeria, Tunisia, Tanzania, and Uganda allowed us to share and appreciate diverse cultural values and practices. These interactions forged new friendships and professional connections, highlighting the universal language of technology that brings us all together. The entire journey was a blend of professional growth, cultural exchange, and personal development. A truly unforgettable experience.

Adding to the excitement, my team finished third in the competition. This achievement was a testament to our hard work and the unwavering support we received from both Huawei and our universities, particularly Mount Kenya University. The intensive training sessions provided by Huawei, coupled with the constant encouragement from our school, played a crucial role in our success. Additionally, our teamwork and collaboration were pivotal. Working closely with Ian Omwenga and Mark Omaiko both from Machakos University, we were able to leverage each other's strengths and overcome challenges together. This collective effort not only validated our dedication but also highlighted the importance of a strong support system and effective teamwork.

I’m very grateful for the university's support as we prepared for the global finals. Beyond the competition itself, this journey has already had a profound impact on my career and friendships. The knowledge gained and the practical exposure during the training have equipped me with valuable skills that will undoubtedly benefit my future endeavours. Through the exposure to cutting edge technologies and rigorous trainings, my passion for IT has been rejuvenated. Additionally, the friendships forged with Ian and Mark, and the connections I am yet to make at the global level, are invaluable assets that will last a lifetime.

I eagerly await the next chapter of this remarkable journey, ready to represent my university, my country, and my region with pride and determination.

Nyeri family in agony after nanny disappears with one-year-old son,"For the past six days, Joyce Wanjeri has been tirelessly searching for her one-year-old son, but to no avail. Her son, Ian Kariuki, was allegedly stolen by his nanny on May 31, she says.

Her efforts, along with those of the Missing Child Kenya Foundation, have led to several clues as to the whereabouts of the suspect - Jane Nyambura - although some have unfortunately hit dead ends.

The police are investigating the matter. The case was reported at Kiamwathi Patrol Base and recorded under Occurrence Book (OB) number 02/01/06/2024.

""The suspect was last seen in Mweiga town, Nyeri on Tuesday, June 4 at 8am, accompanied by another woman who was carrying my son on her back. The three entered a hotel and asked for food,"" Wanjeri said in an interview.

At the hotel, a customer bought them food and also volunteered to buy flour for the child at a nearby shop.

It was only after they had left that the hotel owner realised that one of the women she had served was the same person whose photo had been circulating on social media for a few days.

""The hotel owner alerted us and confirmed with the police that the person she had seen was indeed the suspect we had been looking for all along,"" said Wanjeri.

The information was a ray of hope for the family, who have been travelling from town to town in the district whenever they get a tip-off about the suspect's whereabouts.

Wanjeri, a teacher at Mathenge Technical Training Institute in Nyeri, says she had no worries for the past two months when she employed the suspect as a nanny.

""Nyambura was introverted, peace-loving and never mistreated my two boys. She was recommended by her niece who lives in our neighbourhood in Kiamwathi,"" Wanjeri explained.

The suspect used to work as a caretaker for an elderly woman in Chaka town, Nyeri. She resigned after complaining that she was being overworked by being assigned to farm chores.

On the particular day of May 31 when the nanny disappeared with her son, Wanjeri explains that she left for work at around 7.45am after dropping her six-year-old child off at school.

She left her other son sleeping.

""Usually, while the nanny does her chores, my son spends most of his time playing in our compound,"" said Wanjeri.

As is the norm, Wanjeri said information gathered from her neighbours showed that her son was last seen in the compound at 11am that day.

However, her eldest child returned home from school at 5pm to find the house empty.

The search for the two began at 9pm that evening when Wanjeri returned home from work.

What was strange, she says, was that the suspect had left all her belongings behind, including her phone - making it difficult to trace her.

The food she had prepared for the baby's lunch was also well stored in the fridge.

According to Wanjeri, the nanny did not raise any concerns, except for one instance six days before the incident.

""I had just returned home from work when she approached me and complained that her child had been sent home from school for unpaid fees,"" she recalled. Wanjeri then gave her Sh7,000 to cover the outstanding fees of Sh4,000.

The family describes the bond between the nanny and their son as extremely close.

""There were times when my son refused to be held by anyone but his nanny,"" said Wanjeri's husband, Michael Kariuki.

He says he is currently in contact with the nanny's family in Karatina town, where she comes from.

Story of a ghostly Safari told through bedsheets,"I stood rooted to the spot, literally feeling my blood run cold – even though I was very warmly dressed in my sky blue windbreaker over a black T-shirt – as I stared at the ghost of my cousin.

Safari was dressed in a formal purple shirt, grey khaki pants but sported a shaggy chin and bushy hair, like a chap who hadn’t been to the barber for at least a month.

“Won’t you ask me to come in,” his ghost said, “Or will you leave me here to…”

‘Drown?’ I said in my head, picturing him being swept away in that black Mazda weeks ago.

“…freeze to death in this June chill?”

‘Maybe we feel cold in the presence of ghosts because they are so cold themselves,’ I thought. ‘Unless they come back from hell. Those ones would be hot ghosts.’

Without waiting for an answer, Safari brushed by me, causing the hairs to rise on my arms.

I followed him, but my knees let me down, and I sagged onto the sofa.

After a short while, during which I dared not go into the kitchen lest I find no one there, Safari came back with two tumblers of whiskey.

“A-ar-are you for for…real?” I whispered, after my first swig of whiskey.

“Don’t I look real?” Safari answered, laughing as he also sipped his drink. “I know you think I died, but I did not, Safara.”

I felt a deep tidal wave of relief wash over my body, as Safari got into an incredible story.

Rescued by good Samaritans from the floating debris of the Mazda, with no identity cards on him and short term amnesia, he had spent about a week in a small hospital in Mazeras.

“As my memory returned, I remembered I had taken out some travel insurance with the excellent firm Ensign,” and when he checked, it had an ‘in case of fatal accident’ clause.

So Safari Safara had lain low for another week (after secretly leaving the hospital at night), living at a cheap lodging that did not give a fig about his identity, “just show us the money…”

“How much is the pay out from the insurance?” I found myself whispering.

“Sh1, 589, 398,” he said.

“How much?” I asked.

“One million, five hundred and eighty nine thousand, three hundred and ninety eight bob,” my first cousin said. “Must I spell out figures for you in words, Mike?”

“You are presumed dead, Safari,” I said. “And dead men cannot collect cheques.”

“But their living kin can tell tales, and collect insurance cash as beneficiaries,” Safari said. “I’d made you the beneficiary of the travel life policy. So now you get to collect, cuz…”

“It’s okay,” I whispered, feeling as if still in a vivid dream. “And I will give you every cent, Saf!”

He laughed. “You can’t send money to dead dudes either, bro. You keep it. You need it!”

“How will you, we, ever get away with this, Safari?”

“Easy, Mike,” he replied. “I just quietly slip off to the DRC, I have pals there. Get fake travel docs. Then use my real ones to get into Canada, stay there till end year, then quietly re-enter the US.”

“Your siblings think you are dead, Saf,” I said. “So, you will just show up resurrected at their front door?” Safari shrugged. “Exactly!” and realising that’s what he’d done with me, we both burst into laughter. “No company will go all FBI over paying out a mere meter half to a flood victim, brother…”

That broke me, and I burst into loud sobs, crying “I’m sorry, so sorry, Safari,” as he stared at me.

We are Old School – and did not cry, let alone weep loudly, in front of other men (and most women).

At that moment, the doorbell chimed loudly, and in a second, my inner pendulum swung from sorrow to panic.

Pulling my cousin by the sleeve into the bedroom, I whispered: “That’s Desiree. She cannot find you here because of your insurance plan. Stay here, and I will get rid of her pronto, bro…”

Closing the bedroom door, I walked to the front door, where the doorbell was being buzzed as if by a demoness possessed.Panic had turned to a ball of anger by the time I flung the door open, to find Desiree Simaloi standing there in a simple black dress and heels, a necklace of faux pas pearls around her neck.

“I know I have your tablet, Desiree,” I started, staring at her coldly. “But you cannot come here…”

“Screw the laptop,” she said breathily, and then strongly shoved me back into the door.

“It’s your lap tops I want!” And the next second, she was ripping off my windbreaker, clawing the T-shirt off as my back banged against the bedroom door, dress off so I saw her abs beneath brasserie; and then we were somehow in the bedroom, my outer pendulum wildly swinging…

‘Where on earth was Safari?’ I thought wildly. ‘In the closet?’

Then I realised I had no closet, came to the realisation that my cousin must be under the bed.

Hiding – as Simaloi embarked on an endless course of feeding upon sirloin steak insatiably.

It must have been a couple of hours later when an apparition rose from the floor, swathed in the bedsheets we had discarded on the floor. Simaloi let out a blood-curdling scream.

And Safari, his voice hoarse and very annoyed behind the bedsheets said: “I am the ghost of Safari, come to avenge my death after your boyfriend let me drown in the floods. Cousin, I will be back to continue haunting you tomorrow at eight in the evening. Ciao ciao. For now…”

And with that, the ‘ghost’ floated out of my bedroom, but not before accidentally bumping into the wall and crying out “Ouch!”

"Uber, Bolt threaten to pull out of Kenya over proposed taxes","Digital ride-hailing platforms Bolt and Uber have warned that they would be forced to close down their operations in Kenya if Parliament approves proposals to impose a six percent tax on gross turnover for non-resident firms.

Bolt and Uber separately told the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee that imposing the Significant Economic Presence Tax (SEP) will likely lead to collapse of the industry due to losses or low margins.

The National Treasury is seeking to impose the SEP, which shall be payable by a non-resident person whose income from the provision of services is derived from or accrues in Kenya through a business carried out over a digital marketplace.

The Bill seeks to remove the Digital Service Tax (DST), which is currently charged at the rate of 1.5 percent, and replace it with the SEP charged at the rate of six percent.

“By introducing the six percent Significant Economic Presence Tax (SEP), the effective tax rate for a non-resident in the digital market space will be 22 percent on gross turnover without taking into consideration the operating costs,” Bolt Public Policy Manager George Abasy said.

“SEP tax at six percent will likely lead to collapse of the industry due to losses or low margins. Non-resident companies currently pay VAT at a rate of 16 percent with no opportunity to deduct input VAT. They also pay 1.5 percent in Digital Service Tax (DST) giving an effective tax rate of 17.5 percent on gross turnover, not profit.”

Bolt Africa Tax Manager Celia Kuria told the committee that is chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani that SEP as a tax on gross turnover is comparable to Turnover Tax, which is currently charged at three percent.

“This shows a significant disparity and disproportionate disfavour to non-resident entities and similarly, foreign direct investment,” Ms Kuria said.

“Note that the ride hailing industry in Kenya is governed by National Transport Safety Authority (NTSA) which has capped ride hailing commissions to 18 percent thereby limiting the company’s ability to generate revenue.”

Ms Kuria said that, should the SEP tax be imposed, Bolt is going to be taxed at 22 percent on the topline in addition to a commission capped at 18 percent and VAT at 16 percent, which will see its earnings from a Sh500 ride drop from a profit of Sh1.40 to a net loss of Sh2.

She told the committee that, when a similar SEP tax was introduced in Nigeria, several multinational companies including Microsoft, GlaxoSmithKline, and Uniliver left the country.

Uber BV director Blair Radford asked the committee to reverse the Bill’s proposal to repeal the 1.5 percent DST and replace it at a higher rate of six percent SEP.

“SEP as proposed does not indicate how a non-resident person will be deemed to have created significant economic presence in Kenya therefore becoming liable to tax in Kenya,” Ms Chizeba Nnonyeh, the tax manager at Uber Africa said. She represented Mr Radford to present Uber concerns on the Finance Bill 2024.

“Taxation on digital services in Kenya is still nascent and the increase in rate from 1.5 percent to six percent is too steep. It will impact on users, drivers, the economy and send the non-resident entities directly into loss.”

Both Uber and Bolt asked the committee to delete the proposal of six percent SEPT and retain the rate of 1.5 percent. The firms also demanded the deletion of section 19 of the Finance Bill, 2024 which seeks to amend the Income Tax Act to introduce Withholding Tax on the payments being made on a digital marketplace, arguing it will include taxi passengers and purchasers of food off platforms.

“It is the payer’s responsibility to account for withholding tax when making payment. However, using the average payment for a ride of Sh500, the proposal suggests that the passenger should remit five percent (Sh25) when they take a ride and make a payment,” the companies said.

I’m a mother of a two-year-old boy living with his father. How can I pursue custody?,"Dear Vivian,

I am a mother of a two-year-old son. Recently, his father took him away from me. I want to seek custody of my child. However, I am not sure where to begin or what is considered in custody cases. Please advise.

Nancy Waihenya,

Murang'a



Dear Nancy,

The term ‘child custody’ is often used when a court is determining which parent, relative, or anyone with a legitimate interest in the child’s welfare should be granted physical and legal custody.

You can commence this process by visiting the children’s office or women’s rights organisations that offer access to justice services to members of the public. Ideally, you shall be led through a process of mediation, which will be aimed at achieving a parental responsibility agreement.

If the mediation process fails, you need to file a custody petition at the Children’s Court. Given the urgency of your situation, you may request interim orders for custody. These are temporary orders that can be issued quickly to ensure the child’s safety and well-being until a final decision is made. To obtain interim custody, you must demonstrate to the court that immediate intervention is necessary.

Read: Court grants mother 9 hours a year in child custody case

The court can also refer you and the child’s father to mediation to try and resolve the custody dispute amicably. This form of mediation is called Court Annexed Mediation. If this process fails, the case will proceed to a full hearing. During the hearing, both parties will present evidence and witnesses to support their claims. The court will examine factors to determine the most suitable custody arrangement.

The primary consideration for the court is the best interest of the child. This includes the child’s emotional, physical, and psychological well-being. The court will then assess the ability of each parent to provide a stable, loving, and nurturing environment.

This includes factors such as parenting skills, mental and physical health and the ability to meet the child’s needs. The court considers the existing relationship between the child and each parent. It will also look at which parent has been the primary caregiver and the emotional bond between the child and each parent.

Further, the safety and stability of the child’s living environment are paramount. The court will consider any history of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. The willingness of each parent to facilitate and encourage a relationship between the child and the other parent is also taken into account.

Therefore, it is beneficial to gather any evidence that demonstrates your ability to provide a loving, stable, and supportive environment for your son. This may include testimonies from friends, family and professionals who can attest to your parenting abilities.

As you commence this process, it is important to note that courts favour arrangements that allow the child to maintain a relationship with both parents, where it is safe and appropriate to do so.

Ultimate Championships to spur athletics growth in Kenya,"As a bedrock of athletics talent, the recently-announced World Ultimate Championships is music to Kenyans ears.

It is a competition that bodes well for the future of millions of athletics talents in the country and heralds a new beginning as far as talent growth and development is concerned.

The Ultimate Championships is a new category of competition announced this week by World Athletics, where the best-of-the-best athletes will compete in different categories across three days.

The competitors will be selected solely on world rankings and comprise 8-16 of the best athletes in each discipline.

The Hungarian capital of Budapest will be the first host of this new competition at the end of 2026 and will be subsequently held biennially, with cities bidding to stage the event.

Thrilling competitions

From an athlete’s perspective, including Kenyan, this championship ensures that the motivation to perform will go up a notch.

No longer will athletes take any competition for granted since they will need to improve their world rankings to earn a berth in the Ultimate Championships.

From a fan viewpoint, expect thrilling track and field competitions in various assignments, such as the Diamond League, World Continental Tours, World Championships, World Road Running Championships, World Race Walking Championships and the Olympics.

Many athletes will focus on the “ultimate prize” as they compete in the events.

Add to the fact that the Ultimate Championships offers the highest prize money ever in athletics circles (Sh1.3 billion) in which winners in different disciplines will go home Sh20 million richer.

From a Kenyan perspective, there is now no more reason for athletes to believe the age-old notion that talent doesn’t pay.

Financial windfall

Indeed, this is the time to train hard and win clean as you steer clear of any vices that might stifle your promising career.

To be part of the Ultimate Championships will be the perfect dream for many athletes, most of whom come from humble backgrounds.

Beyond the financial windfall, there is the prestige of emerging top ahead of other kings or queens of your respective disciplines.

As one of the athletics powerhouses, Kenya can only look forward with glee to the opening ceremony of the inaugural edition in Budapest.

As usual, our athletes will be among the 400 in contention; nonetheless, the journey to being part of this group commences now.

Kenya’s all set to host the 2024 World Kiswahili Day,"Preparations are in top gear for Kenya to host the World Kiswahili Day for the first time this year.

Gender, Culture, the Arts and Heritage Cabinet Secretary Aisha Jumwa yesterday formed a National Organising Committee, comprising 17 members, to arrange for the third World Kiswahili Day celebrations on July 5 to 7.

Key events will include Usiku wa Mswahili, with the climax being the World Kiswahili Day on July 7.

President William Ruto is expected to be the chief guest during the celebrations, whose proposed venue is Mombasa, the minister said.

“Kenya has been granted the opportunity to host this year’s celebrations. We must do the necessary preparations and convince those who proposed our name that they made the right choice,” Ms Jumwa said. “I will ensure funds are made available for everything to run smoothly.”

One of the outcomes of the historic events, the Cabinet secretary said, would be the introduction of a National Kiswahili-Speaking Day.

“There’ll be a special day set aside when every Kenyan, including the President, judges in courts, civil servants and teachers will be expected to speak exclusively in Kiswahili.”

Regional celebrations

During celebrations by the East African Community (EAC) to mark World Kiswahili Day last year, Kenya was named the host of this year’s events.

The second World Kiswahili Day regional celebrations took place in Kampala, Uganda, in 2023.

Zanzibar hosted the inaugural event that was presided over by President Hussein Ali Mwinyi.

That was a year after the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) , sitting in Paris, France, declared July 7 the World Kiswahili Language Day.

On the establishment of the National Kiswahili Council, which has been delayed since the Cabinet gave the nod in 2014, Ms Jumwa said the bill is at an advanced stage. She explained the reasons for the delay.

“It has taken a long after being presented to the Office of the Attorney-General, but that is because the bill has to be translated into Kiswahili,” she said.

“The bill has already been translated into Kiswahili, thanks to Prof Kimani Njogu, who volunteered to do it as a patriotic Kenyan and Kiswahili scholar.

“The council is a requirement by the EAC and Kenya cannot have the Kiswahili Council without the law.”

The EAC Treaty, Article 119, provides for the development and promotion of indigenous languages especially Kiswahili as a lingua franca of the region.

Police yet to crack case of granny’s body found 9 months after death,"One year after detectives opened investigations into the mysterious death of an 82-year-old grandmother, whose body was discovered nine months after she went missing, the findings are inconclusive.

On June 2, last year, at a homestead in Thika's landless estate, crime scene investigators from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) discovered a badly decomposed body.

The home belonged to a widow, Leah Njeri Githua, whose children kept wiring money for upkeep to her mobile phone without checking on her, only for it to later emerge she had been long dead.

The body was lying next to the carcass of a dog.

A further search by the DCI at the home revealed at least 20 dead chicken in the compound.

Homicide investigators were called in to help unravel the mystery death after the shocking discovery.

Natural causes

After an extensive probe by the DCI that went on for close to six months, the investigators have now concluded that it is not possible to establish if Njeri was killed or died of natural causes.

Sources said that investigators have now recommended that the Directorate of Public Prosecutions recommends an inquest into the death of the granny.

A granddaughter of Njeri, who had visited the home, reported that she was missing and could not be reached on her phone.

The investigators combed the homestead for clues and also recorded statements of 10 individuals.

Among those who recorded statements were her children and neighbours. At the time, she was believed to be missing and not dead.

Digging into the family history, investigations revealed that Njeri had been living alone after all her children left home.

Some of the children who are doing well in life, had been sending their mother cash for her upkeep every month. But none of them had visited her for about nine months before she was discovered dead.

At the start of the probe, the investigators picked some bones and clothes believed to belong to Njeri. The samples were taken to the Government Chemist in Nairobi for analysis and DNA testing.

Body parts

Neighbours interviewed told investigators that the last time they had seen Njeri alive was nine months prior to her body being found. They, too, said they were stunned by the recovery of the body parts believed to be her remains.

Also questioned by the detectives is a Nyumba Kumi official who provided insights into what may have transpired.

When the Nation visited the homestead last year, neighbours said they did not think anything amiss even after they failed to see Njeri in the neighbourhood.

“We thought that she had gone to visit one of her sons in the city until we learnt of her death,"" said Michael Njuguna, a neighbour.

Detectives who spoke to the Nation at the start of the investigations said the police were pursuing, among other leads, the possibility that Njeri was killed.

Huge sigh of relief as State secures Sh1.2bn vaccines,"The Ministry of Health yesterday announced that routine childhood vaccines worth Sh1.25 billion have been purchased, although some hospitals still reported a shortage.

In a statement, State Department for Medical Services Principal Secretary Harry Kimtai said that the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) had delivered BCG, Oral Polio, Tetanus-Diphtheria and Measles-Rubella vaccines to the country.

An insider at the Health ministry had said that the government had until July 1 to pay Unicef and Gavi a Sh1.5 billion debt for the last financial year, before they could release a fresh consignment of Sh8 billion.

That is the reason why Unicef and Gavi had refused to supply vaccines to Kenya for this financial year.

Investigations by the Nation in public health facilities around the country found that they did not have the life-saving vaccines.

As a result, most of the babies born in the last three months have not been vaccinated.

The vaccines that were delivered are 1,209,500 doses for Measles-Rubella, Oral Polio (3,032,000 doses), foretanus-Diphtheri (1,000,000 doses) and BCG (3,129,000 doses).

“The vaccines are being processed for urgent distribution to nine regional vaccine stores across the country. To expedite this process, the Ministry of Health has engaged additional refrigerated trucks to ensure these life-saving vaccines reach our health facilities and communities by the second week of June 2024,” PS Kimtai said.

The government urged healthcare staff to work with community health teams to ensure all children who missed vaccines are up todate in their immunisation schedule.

Jabs available

“We urge all caregivers to take their children back to health facilities for immunization as vaccine supply has now normalised,” he said, adding that the ministry is grateful for the support received from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, that made the jabs available.

“The Ministry of Health is exploring innovative options for sustainable financing of vaccine procurement and programme operations to prevent future stockouts,” Mr Kimtai assured.

At the same time, President William Ruto has said Kenya has formally joined the International Vaccines Institute (IVI) as a state party.

The President said IVI has committed to establish a country and project office in Nairobi, which will be the organisation’s regional headquarters.

This comes after the cost of Covid-19 vaccines pushed many Global South countries, Kenya included, at the back of the queue during the pandemic.

As a result, Kenya decided to manufacture vaccines, biotherapeutics and diagnostics. And in February last year, the country officially presented a letter seeking to join IVI that is based in Seoul, South Korea.

Vaccine nationalism

Speaking during the accession ceremony to the IVI in Seoul, President Ruto said during the Covid-19 pandemic, Kenyans and millions of people on the African continent bore the brunt of arbitrary distribution and denial of access to vaccines. He said there was vaccine nationalism, and the situation was magnified by Africa’s over-reliance on external manufacturers.

“The time has come, therefore, for Africa to actualise health sovereignty by liberating itself from dependency on unsustainable frameworks, and accelerating initiatives to become self-sufficient in vaccine production,” Dr Ruto said.

“A fundamental value of Pan-African solidarity is that no one is free until all people are free,” said, adding that in vaccine supply, no one is safe until everyone is safe.

“Making vaccines universally accessible to all our people, regardless of nationality and status is an urgent imperative that we must respond to,” he added.

The President said that Kenya joining IVI is the culmination of a well-coordinated joint endeavour between the Ministry of Health, the Kenya BioVax Institute, the Kenya Medical Research Institute and experts from IVI.

The Head of State urged developers to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation and enhance support for research and development in biotechnology because that will enable the African continent to take charge and define the future of healthcare.

Technology transfer

“Membership to IVI gives Kenya access to a network for vaccines and technology transfer as we build our internal self-reliance through local manufacturing,” Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha who accompanied President Ruto to South Korea said.



In an interview with the Nation, IVI Director-General Dr Jerome Kim explained that IVI is an international organisation with a mission to discover, develop and deliver safe, effective and affordable vaccines for global health.

“IVF works on diseases that major vaccine companies do not want to work on,” he said, adding that IVI develops vaccine solutions and transfers them to companies that will be the ultimate manufacturers.

“We help these companies to develop and test the vaccine, to secure approvals from local and international regulatory authorities and then work with Gavi, and others to make sure that the vaccines are used and make an impact.

"Counties flout law, open 287 bank accounts in 3 months","Counties opened 287 more accounts at commercial banks between December and March this year in continued breach of the law, hurting efforts to boost accountability on how the devolved units spend public funds.

An analysis of official data from the Controller of Budget shows that counties had 1,668 accounts at commercial banks in March from 1,381 at the end of last year.

The devolved units are under the law only allowed to open and maintain bank accounts at the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) for ease of accountability. The only exemption is for imprest accounts for petty cash and revenue collection. The number could be higher given that some such as Nairobi and Mombasa did not disclose the number of accounts they are operating.

Underhand deals

Dr Margaret Nyakango, the Controller of Budget, has on many occasions flagged use of such accounts, on grounds that they are prone to abuse and with a lack of checks, can be used to drive underhand deals using taxpayer funds.

“Key challenges that hampered effective budget execution during the period; use of commercial bank accounts to operate the established public funds and other operational accounts contrary to the regulations,” Dr Nyakango says.

Counties with the most new accounts in the period include Bungoma with 31 bringing its number to 352, Machakos with 26 new ones bringing its tally to 31, and Taita Taveta with 27 new ones to 37 accounts.

But other counties notably, Kwale cut the number of accounts at commercial banks by 102 to have 63 accounts as of March. Makueni closed seven accounts, remaining with 17 in the period.

The Public Finance Management (County Governments) Regulations, 2015 bar regional governments from operating accounts at commercial banks, except those for petty cash and revenue collection. Counties use bank accounts for their car loan and mortgage schemes, debt collection, hospitals, bursaries, and conditional grants.

Track public expenditure

The growing number of bank accounts operated by counties has made it more difficult for the Controller of Budget to track public expenditure. There have been concerns that some of these accounts are used for private dealings with commercial banks, exposing taxpayers to losses and suits. Dr Nyakango recently lost a push to have her office granted real-time access to the bank accounts that counties hold at the CBK.

The CoB had since 2021 been pushing CBK and Treasury to be granted real-time access to the accounts of the counties to curb the inexplicable use of funds.

The failed attempt allows counties to escape scrutiny amid growing concerns of massive corruption in clearing pending bills.

FIVB Foundation will push the sport’s popularity across the world,"Last week, the global volleyball community witnessed a landmark event at the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) Headquarters in Lausanne - the launch of the FIVB Volleyball Foundation.

The launch of the FIVB Volleyball Foundation saw FIVB President Dr Ary Graca mark yet another milestone in line with his campaign promise of “innovation and opportunity” when he first assumed office in 2012.

The FIVB Volleyball Foundation, which seeks to use the global reach and power of volleyball to support community projects worldwide that have a positive impact, now completes a trilogy that Dr Graca envisioned back in 2012 that also features the FIVB, which is the administrative arm, and Volleyball World - the commercial arm launched back in 2021.

While forming the Foundation, Graca’s vision was to help the global volleyball fraternity realise the social power of the sport in line with FIVB Goal Number 9, which is to make volleyball the number one sport that serves family needs through social development and humanitarian programmes.

By identifying pioneering projects from across the globe, the Foundation will support and provide funding and resources to advance certified projects that promote the social well-being of communities through volleyball.

Two projects were selected as pilot projects for the Foundation - the Brahmaputra Volleyball League (BVL) in India and the Githurai Volleyball Kimbo Academy in Kenya.

While BVL boasts over 4,000 boys and girls who participate in their leagues across Assam state in India, Githurai Kimbo Academy is home to 96 kids, with Kenyan international Brian Kamonde as one of its shining beneficiaries.

The BVL has helped break cultural stereotypes and inspire hope among children from humble backgrounds to pursue their dreams. Another significant impact of the league is how it brought together communities.

Hub for volleyball talent

The BVL has become a source of pride for the people of Assam, who come out in large numbers to support their teams.

Githurai Kimbo, on the other hand, is run by current and former Githurai Kimbo Volleyball Club players, who serve as volunteer coaches supported by partners such as Lily Academy, a private school located in Githurai.

The academy teaches volleyball and life skills and provides education support as a pathway to a brighter future.

Dreaded for its reputation for organised crime and other social vices, Githurai has recently emerged as a hub for volleyball talent, thanks to Githurai Kimbo Volleyball Academy.

Some of its notable beneficiaries include middle blockers Kamonde and Josphat Muchai, who play for top-tier clubs Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Defence Forces, as well as Strathmore University’s men’s team libero Peter Kamau.

It’s amazing how these two projects use diverse means to arrive at the same goal - empowering communities through volleyball.

In his speech, Graca emphasised the need for The Foundation to also increase mass participation in the sport, citing the innate ability of volleyball to unite people.

“The Volleyball Foundation will play a vital role in promoting positive social values, helping to create a more collaborative and harmonious world,” said Graca, who is also the FIVB Foundation President.

Promoting social projects

“The Foundation is dedicated to creating a world where everyone has access to sport, no matter their gender, age, background or position. Where they have the opportunity to be healthy and active. To experience the joys of volleyball. And to learn important skills that will serve them throughout their lives.”

With an initial CHF 559,000 (Sh78 million) raised during the launch to get the Foundation up and running, and a strong leadership cast of former Russian international Elizaveta Bracht as Executive Director and volleyball legends Mireya Luis, Vladimir Grbic and Gilberto “Giba” Godoy as ambassadors, all signs point towards a well-run Foundation that could be a game-changer for volleyball in terms of popularity all over the world.

Volleyball is the fourth most popular sport globally, with more than 800 million fans. Moving forward, the Foundation will not only help the global volleyball community connect better but also ensure that volleyball rivals sports such as football in terms of community engagement.

As announced by Graça, FIVB plans to allocate an annual budget of CHF 1 million (Sh145 million) for the Volleyball Foundation in 2025 and 2026, pending the approval of the FIVB World Congress later this year.

This solid budget will allow the Foundation to expand its global reach in terms of the social projects it supports.

Key supporters of the Volleyball Foundation include renowned organisations KITT & KISS, Mikasa, Decathlon, the Qatar Foundation, Generations for Peace and the Jordan Olympic Committee, which means the provision of basic equipment such as balls and nets to various social projects will not be a problem.

By promoting social projects all over the world, the Foundation will bring volleyball to the doorstep of various homes, ensuring that volleyball is one of the few sports that young children make first contact with while growing up.

Given the flexible nature of volleyball as a sport, which means it can be played anywhere (sand, concrete, tarmac or cemented surface) and in the tiniest of spaces, this could translate to mass participation in the sport, which will boost its popularity and catapult it into the top three - another legacy to remember Dr Graca with as he enters the homestretch of his 12-year term.

The church vows that healed my lifetime shame and a husband who saw my beauty beyond fistula,"November 4, 2023, will forever be etched in the mind of Mary Nthenya Wambua. On this day, her husband of 25 years, Comas Wambua, officially married her in a church ceremony, fulfilling a desire she had longed for over decades.

Mary walked down the aisle at Mwaani Catholic Church in Makueni County, radiantly tying the knot with the love of her life. The flowing white wedding dress moved gracefully as she made her way down the aisle on that bright, sunny morning.

What made this memory even more joyous was that the wedding fulfilled a promise her husband had made when he first married her 26 years ago.

Mary was born with obstetric fistula, a condition she battled until undergoing successful surgery last year. Fistula is a devastating childbirth injury that creates a hole between the birth canal and bladder or rectum, causing uncontrollable leakage of urine or faeces.

Unlike most cases of obstetric fistula caused by obstructed and prolonged labour, Mary's condition was congenital, existing from birth. While often hereditary, congenital fistulas can also result from actions or exposures during pregnancy or childbirth.

When her husband initially married her, he vowed to stand by her and support her despite her condition, promising to honour her with a church wedding once she was healed.

When nation.africa visits their home in the rural village of Kyamsoi about 70 kilometres from Wote town, Mary vividly recounted the excitement of exchanging vows with her husband on that bright, sunny morning.

""This is what I had been praying for all my adult life. It was the happiest day. The man who married me in my youth, despite my shortcomings, wed me in church in broad daylight in front of God and man. I was so humbled by his love for me,"" she says, beaming with joy.

However, beneath her radiant smile lay a tough journey spanning nearly five decades as she battled with obstetric fistula. Mary opens up about the pain and challenges, citing stigma as one of the worst aspects. Her lowest moment came when she was unable to receive an education due to her condition.

""The condition made me drop out of school so early,"" Mary explains sombrely.

Read: ""I couldn't control a fart"", one woman's crusade to end fistula stigma

""When my parents took me, the teachers chased me away, fearing I would infect the other pupils. The embarrassment was unbearable.""

She vividly recalls the taunts and ridicule she faced, as her incontinence led to accidents during her menstrual cycle.

""I was the laughing stock of the school. They nicknamed me 'Kinungi', meaning 'the woman who always smells',"" she says, her eyes clouding with the memory.

Unable to cope with the stigma, Mary dropped out of primary school in Class Four. She attempted to continue her education at a local polytechnic, hoping for a more understanding environment. However, the same cruel fate awaited her there.

""My fellow students belittled and side-lined me. At lunchtime, I was always served food in isolation, as they claimed I smelled of urine. I had no friends and was always alone,"" she recalls, the pain still evident decades later.

At age 20, Mary's life took a turn when she moved to Nairobi to live with her supportive brother, the only person who truly understood and loved her unconditionally despite her condition. It was here that she met her future husband. Initially hesitant to pursue a relationship due to her fistula, she eventually accepted his marriage proposal after he assured her of his unconditional acceptance and love.

However, navigating married life with fistula was far from easy.

""The pregnancy periods were the most difficult,"" Mary confides.

""Carrying a child while battling fistula is an incredibly challenging experience, both physically and emotionally."" As a result, after having two children, Mary made the difficult decision to never give birth again, undergoing a tubal ligation procedure.

For years, her parents had desperately sought a cure, consulting witchdoctors and performing rituals in the belief that her condition was caused by a generational curse or witchcraft. However, no traditional interventions provided relief. The persistent incontinence and stigma took a heavy toll, leaving Mary on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Turning point

Her turning point finally came in March 2022, when she underwent successful fistula surgery at the Makueni County Referral Hospital.

Mary's triumphant story mirrors that of many others in the county, after the government introduced fistula care services in partnership with Jhpiego, a non-profit organisation affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.

""That surgery was life-changing,"" Mary says, her eyes shining with gratitude.

""After living with this condition for so long, I finally felt whole again. The weight of shame and stigma was lifted off my shoulders.""

Post-surgery, Mary confidently returned to church and social settings she had avoided for most of her adult life while fighting stigma.

According to Dr Doris Mbithi, an obstetrician-gynaecologist and fistula surgeon heading the Makueni Fistula Care Unit, hundreds of women have been screened, and many have undergone fistula repair surgeries since the unit's inception in March 2022.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Country Director, Anders Thomsen, emphasises the need for advocacy and awareness to prevent and treat this preventable condition.

""Fistula is a tragic but avoidable injury that robs women of their dignity and quality of life,"" he states. ""We must continue raising awareness, dispelling stigma, and ensuring all women have access to quality maternal healthcare.""

Thomsen calls on affected women to seek help and advocates for preventive care through timely hospital referrals and professional birth attendants.

""By empowering women with knowledge and resources, we can stop fistulas before they occur, and provide life-changing treatment for those already suffering,"" he adds.

The Makueni County government has made strides in addressing the issue, prioritising hospital deliveries to reduce the risk of obstetric fistulas. However, with only about 10 fistula surgeons available nationwide, access to fistula care remains limited across Kenya. Efforts are underway to train more surgeons and develop routine fistula management in all 47 counties by 2030.

""We have developed a comprehensive training package to equip more doctors with the skills needed to perform fistula repair surgeries,"" explains Dr Karen Aura, the fistula lead at the Reproductive and Maternal Health Division at the Ministry of Health.

""Our goal is to have fistula care integrated into routine maternal health services across the country.""

While commending Makueni County's efforts, the head of the Reproductive and Maternal Health division, Edward Serem, challenges other counties to prioritise fistula prevention.

""The most sustainable way to address fistulas is to prevent them from happening in the first place,"" he states. ""This requires developing the capacity of medical professionals, retaining them in their areas, and strengthening primary healthcare and referral systems.""

As for Mary, her long-awaited church wedding marked the beginning of a new chapter, free from the shackles of fistula and stigma.

""That day, I felt like a true bride – beautiful, loved, and complete,"" she says, her radiant smile a testament to her resilience and the power of hope.

""My husband's unwavering love and support carried me through the darkest of times, and now, we can truly embrace the future together.""

"Don’t vilify muguka, says AG Justin Muturi on controversial crop","Attorney-General Justin Muturi has waded into the raging controversy over the muguka and miraa trade amid sustained pressure by Coast counties to curtail their sale, if not ban them altogether.

Insisting that the crops should not be vilified, Mr Muturi said Kenyans should appreciate the value of muguka and miraa to the people of Embu.

“Let us not try to demonise muguka before we have full scientific facts about it,” the attorney-general said at the Kenya School of Government in Embu during the launch of the Fourth Medium Term Plan 2023-2027.

The official said that the issues that pertain to the muguka trade need a lot of consultation with the views of all stakeholders taken into consideration. He added that the matter has not been brought to him, as the State’s legal advisor, to address it.

""This matter has not found its way to me, when it does, I will look into it,"" he said

However, he commended the entire Embu leadership, led by Governor Cecily Mbarire, for their stand on muguka.

Read: What the science says about muguka

Muguka farming has for many years been a critical economic activity for residents of Embu, especially in the expansive and semi-arid Mbeere sub-region.

The recent ban imposed on its sale, transportation and distribution in Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi counties has dealt the residents a devastating blow.

Records obtained from the Embu County Government indicate that at least 65,000 residents are engaged in muguka farming.

Coast counties are the biggest markets for the stimulant.

Dry seasons

One kilogramme of muguka retails at between Sh300 and Sh600, with prices topping Sh1,000 per kilo during the dry seasons.

Local residents together with their leaders have dismissed claims by its antagonists at the coast that muguka is a harmful drug that causes impotency, mental illness and disability.

Read: Muguka: Embu County’s Sh22bn-a-year cash cow

They insisted that muguka and miraa are scheduled crops that are protected under the law.

Ms Mbarire revealed that her administration together with the County Assembly of Embu have engaged their legal teams to defend muguka farmers.

She explained that the botanical name for miraa is catha edulis and the active ingredient is called carthinone.

She added that there is no law distinguishing between miraa and muguka nor prohibiting their sale or consumption.

“Muguka is not a drug; it is a popular variety of miraa which is more affordable and whose carthinone levels are higher than the traditional miraa,"" the governor stated.

Ms Mbarire further pointed out that the muguka business engages the people of Embu largely as farmers, with those from Meru and other areas in Central Kenya being middlemen and transporters.

The muguka value chain is estimated to contribute to approximately Sh22 billion per year to the economy of Embu.

Muguka farmers, together with other players who have invested heavily in the muguka value chain, stand to lose a lot in terms of revenue and livelihoods.

Sh10.8 million i

Farmers deliver 36 tonnes of muguka to Mombasa every day, earning the county Sh10.8 million in transport levies.

Ms Mbarire said leaders at the coast have refused to meet with their Embu counterparts to discuss the matter.

“Now that the coast leaders don't want to meet us to discuss about muguka, we are waiting the final word from President William Ruto,"" said Ms Mbarire.

Kiambeere MCA Lenny Masters Mwaniki told the coast governors to respect the rule of law.

""Muguka is not an outlawed crop, and the ban imposed on it by coast governors is null and void,"" Mr Mwaniki said.

"University of Nairobi rises into top 1,000 global varsity rankings","The University of Nairobi (UoN) has moved into the top 1,000 universities in the world in the QS World University Rankings 2025, continuing an upward trend in international post-secondary institutional standings.

The institution was ranked in the 909-950 band in a pool of 1,500 published international institutions, up from the 1,000-1,200 band it has held since 2022.

The UoN’s improved ranking this year is a result of gains in key categories including employment outcomes, academic reputation, international research and faculty-student ratio.

The institution's highest ranking indicator was employment outcomes, which increased by 92.5 percent and was placed in the 251-300 band. Academic reputation increased slightly from 9.6 percent in 2023 to 10 percent currently.

Reputation category

In the employer reputation category, a metric that assesses employers' perceptions of post-secondary graduates, the UoN recorded a 2.9 percent drop to 11.7 percent, down from 14.6 percent last year.

“However, the institution saw an improvement in the ranking of citations per faculty, which stood at 20.1 percent and positioned itself in the 1,051-1,100 range. This indicator is based on a ratio measuring the average number of citations per faculty member,” the data shows.

The UoN is home to many researchers, some of whom are among the world's most highly cited in fields such as health sciences.

In the category of international research networks, the university scored an average of 50.1 percent, an indicator that assesses the richness and diversity of an institution's research partnerships.

The lowest scoring indicator was sustainability, with 1.8 percent, despite being one of the leading institutions charting the course and driving change towards a more sustainable future.

Last year, UoN was ranked 1,425 out of 2,000 institutions by the Centre for World University Ranking, the only Kenyan university listed.

Employment outcomes

Kenyatta University, which joined the rankings last year, has maintained its position in the 1,201-1,400 range, with employment outcomes being the highest indicator.

Regionally, South Africa holds the top four positions on the African continent, with the University of Cape Town the continent's highest-ranked institution at 171, up two places from last year.

Cairo University in Egypt completes the top five in Africa, ranking 350 globally.

Globally, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology held the top spot for the thirteenth year, while Imperial College London moved up to second place.

The University of Oxford and Harvard University are ranked third and fourth respectively. The University of Cambridge completes the top five.

This global ranking is the first to include both sustainability and employability factors as key measures in its methodology.

Since the 2024 ranking, the group has added a five percent weighting to sustainability to reflect the crucial role universities play in setting the course and driving change towards a more sustainable future.

"Parastatal reforms split PSC, State House teams","The Public Service Commission (PSC) has told off the Executive Office of the President over new guidelines on the management of parastatals, pointing to a simmering struggle over control of the State-owned entities that manage billions of shillings.

PSC chairperson Anthony Muchiri has termed Executive Order No. 3 of 2024 on Guidelines for the Management of State Corporations as illegal and unconstitutional for excluding the commission from their formulation.

The executive order gazetted by President William Ruto on May 24 provides for, among others, terms and conditions of service for boards and human resource management of State corporations.

Dr Ruto directed that the new guidelines “shall and do supersede the Guidelines issued in November 2004”.

State House’s Chief of Staff & Head of the Public Service Felix Koskei launched the guidelines on Tuesday at Bomas of Kenya at a meeting attended by chairpersons and CEOs of State Corporations, vice chancellors of public universities, and other government agencies.

The Business Daily has, however, established that Mr Muchiri had warned Mr Koskei against rolling out the guidelines, insisting that State corporations and public universities were part of public service and that their management is constitutionally under the PSC.

“The Guidelines are in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution and are, therefore, invalid pursuant to the provisions of Article 2(4) of the Constitution…,” Mr Muchiri wrote in a letter to Mr Koskei on May 28.

“The guidelines violate several court decisions that found that it is only the Commission (PSC) that has the power to establish offices and approve human resource instruments in the public service.”

Article 2(4) provides that “any law, including customary law, that is inconsistent with the Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency, and any act or omission in contravention of this Constitution is invalid”.



The PSC says the authors of the Guidelines relied on and made reference to Sections 5(3) and 27 of the State Corporations Act which have both “been found to be unconstitutional for violating the constitutional mandate of the Commission as provided in Article 234 of the Constitution”.

Article 234 gives the PSC powers over the functioning of public service entities, excluding those for State officers, Ambassadors, High Commissioners and consular representatives. Other offices where the PSC has no powers are those under the Parliamentary Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission, Teachers Service Commission, National Service Commission and County Public Service.

“State Corporations and public universities are part of the public service,” Mr Muchiri says.

“This is an issue that has been litigated and determined by courts several times, including in a most recent Court of Appeal decision on April 27, 2024, in … Civil Appeal No 156 of 2016 between Salaries and Remuneration Commission and National Hospital [sic] Insurance Fund and two others.”

Read: Treasury to take over more than 40 parastatals in changes

The gazettement of the revised guidelines for the management of parastatals was preceded by a Cabinet resolution of April 23 that followed a directive by Dr Ruto on fiscal consolidation and management of State corporations.

“The new policy also aligns the determination of the terms and conditions of service in the agencies with the provisions of the Constitution and the relevant laws,” a dispatch from the Ruto-chaired Cabinet read in part. “Consequently, the revised guidelines will provide salary bands and allowances for CEOs, board members, Vice-Chancellors, Chancellors and members of university councils.”

The Cabinet further resolved that the Salaries and Remunerations Commission and the State Corporations Advisory Committee will be key players in determining the terms and conditions for State corporations.

“The Commission was not consulted during the generation of the guidelines. It is recommended that a stakeholder meeting be urgently constituted to address the constitutional and legal implications highlighted in the instant advisory,” Mr Muchiri says in the letter.

Earlier on March 26, Dr Ruto met the chairperson and chief executives where he directed them to cut their recurrent budgets for the year starting July by at least a third.

“We will shut them [loss-making State corporations] down, we will get their employees to go and work somewhere else and at least we will stop making the losses,” Dr Ruto warned.

“And I want some of those institutions to volunteer [to close down]. Some of them should start telling us,' Please close our institutions and assign us other jobs' so that Kenyans stop losing money.”

A day later on March 27, the Treasury issued a circular that made it clear that entities identified for mergers and winding up will get minimal budgetary allocation for the year starting July.

The financial risks associated with struggling parastatals amounted to Sh1.24 trillion by the end of the last financial year in June 2023.

These include Sh145.4 billion in guaranteed loans, Sh111.80 billion in non-guaranteed loans and Sh983.20 billion on-lent loans.

Olunga: Cote d’Ivoire not in our minds for now,"Harambee Stars captain Michael Olunga has warned his teammates against complacency when they face Burundi’s Swallows in a Group 'F' 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi on Friday.

The match will kick off at 4pm Kenyan time and will be broadcast live on national station KBC.

“We respect Cote d'Ivoire as they are African champions but Burundi is also a tough opponent which we must deal with first,"" said Olunga on phone from Lilongwe on Thursday.

""Everybody is talking about Cote d'Ivoire and underrating Burundi which has the same style of play like us and is strong opponent. We should tackle them with a lot of respect,” he added.

Kenya will face group favourites Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday at the same venue.

Football Kenya Federation moved Harambee Stars' home fixtures to Lilongwe's Bingu stadium is because the only venues that could these international matches were MISC and Nyayo Stadium which are currently closed for renovations.

Impressive run

Incidentally, Malawi will be hosting Sao Tome at the same venue on Thursday in a Group 'H' match.

Olunga said he Kenya will have to be at their best to prevail.

The Al-Duhail marksman added that the Malawians have been hospitable to them.

“We were received well in Malawi and our training has also been well. The team is adequately prepared to face Burundi, we will also be targeting a positive outcome against Cote d’Ivoire,” added the former Gor Mahia man.

Olunga heads into the two matches on the back of an impressive run of seven goals scored in Stars’ last three matches.

The former Gor Mahia and Tusker man scored a brace in their 5-0 World Cup qualifying rout of Seychelles on November 20 in Abidjan.

Olunga then helped himself to five goals in the Four Nations tournament held in Malawi in March where Kenya hammered Malawi 4-0 before thumping Zimbabwe 3-1 in the final on March 26.

Latest Fifa rankings

Midfielder John Ochieng said they will approach the match cautiously but “with a winning mentality”.

According to the latest Fifa rankings, Kenya are placed 33 places above Burundi at 107th.

In their eight meetings, Kenya have won three, Burundi two with three draws.

Stars have since Monday been training at Silver Stadium, which is a 10-minute drive from Bingu National Stadium.

Burkinabe Jean Quattara is the centre referee assisted by compatriots Seydou Tiama (first assistant referee), Habib Oumar Sanou (second assistant referee), and Benoit Bado (fourth official).

Tanzanian Leslie Liunda is the referee assessor while South African Bennett Kenneth Bailey will be the match commissioner.

Regular and VIP tickets will retail at 5,000 Malawian Kwacha (about Sh376) and 20,000 Malawian Kwacha (Sh1,500) respectively, and will be available on match day.

Private sector activity defies floods to grow at fastest pace in 20 months,"Private sector activity in Kenya defied ravaging floods to grow at the fastest pace in more than one and a half years, largely helped by easing inflationary pressures and stabilising shilling, findings of a closely-watched monthly survey suggested Wednesday.

The Stanbic Kenya Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) — a month-on-month measure for private sector activity such as output, new orders, and employment— rose to 51.8 in May from 50.1 a month earlier.

The growth in the PMI index, the sharpest in 20 months, signals increased business in May compared to April. PMI readings above 50 signal growth in private sector business conditions, while levels below that mark, point to a contraction.

The growth in business activity defied the projection by corporate managers of a slowdown in deals following heavy flooding which started late April through last month, disrupting activities in key sectors of transport, education and trade.

The PMI findings, based on feedback from about 400 corporate managers, showed that services, manufacturing wholesale and retail sectors posted expansion in activity despite the flooding.

Farming and construction activities, however, contracted during the month amidst floods which claimed more than 200 lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of persons.

“Private sector activity was surprisingly strong in May, implying a further improvement in economic activity, as we had expected to see some impact from the recent floods,” Christopher Legilisho, an economist with South African-based Standard Bank, the parent firm of Stanbic Bank, wrote in the PMI report. “Output and new orders recorded strong gains in May as firms reported increased consumer demand.”



Inflation, a measure of the increase in the cost of goods and services over the previous year, was largely unchanged in May at 5.1 percent on steading food and energy costs, slightly increased from 5.0 a month earlier.

The shilling, on the other hand, was largely stable, exchanging at 133.28 units against the bullish US dollar at the close of the month compared to 133.80 units at the start — a marginal depreciation of 1.12 percent.

The easing inflationary pressure amidst the strengthening shilling in a net import economy was expected to free up some cash for expenditure.

The shilling, on the other hand, exchanged at an average of 130.23 units against the globally bullish US dollar, a 2.29 percent gain over April.

Read: Business activity rebounds first time since August

The easing inflationary pressures amidst steadying shilling in a net import economy helped cut input costs for the second month running, freeing up cash for firms which enabled them to raise output for the first time since February.

The report further suggests falling inflation helped sales in Kenya’s private sector grow at the strongest rate in nearly one and a half years (since January 2023) in May.

“Encouragingly, input prices fell in May for a second month, with respondents noting a decline in fuel prices and lower imports costs due to a more favourable exchange rate,” Mr Legilisho said. “Meanwhile, output prices increased only slightly. This aligns with our view that inflationary pressures have eased.”

Baby Astra: The chimpanzee born from failed birth control,"At Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary on Ol Pejeta Ranch in Laikipia County, the air is still. A few minutes to mid-day, the 30 chimpanzees that live here call their friends to eat. Among them is baby Astra, the sanctuary’s youngest chimpanzee aged one year and five months. His delivery in 2022 is believed by experts at the sanctuary to have resulted from a failed family planning procedure.

About a year before he was born, the sanctuary had placed contraceptive implants— the same kind that people use to prevent pregnancy— in sexually mature females and conducted vasectomies in mature males to prevent breeding.

Dr Florence Muthoni, the sanctuary’s resident chimpanzee vet, explains that the sanctuary does not breed chimpanzees in obedience to a regulation from Pan Africa Sanctuary Alliance, a regulatory body that governs most sanctuaries in Africa. According to the alliance, rescued chimps in a sanctuary should not be bred due to constrained resources and to avoid creating hybrids.

“We do this because of resources. You do not want to do overbreeding in an area where the chimpanzees are not endemic. This is not their natural habitat. Because there are three sub-species here, you also do not want to create hybrids. Besides, the more you interbreed, the more you create genetic defects,” explains Dr Muthoni.

“Sometimes, just like in humans, our implants fail and the result is that we have a baby. We are taking care of the baby and the mother. The baby is currently weaned off breastfeeding, and we keep him on a healthy diet for optimum growth,” she adds.

The American Association of Zoo Veterinarians advises that while considering contraceptive options, reversibility and safety as well as potential weight gain must be considered when offering hormonal methods. The association notes that implants such as MGA implants and Norplants work by interfering with fertilisation by thickening cervical mucus, interrupting sperm transport and disrupting implantation. It adds that 29 per cent of the female chimpanzees who have utilised solid MGA implants have experienced a four per cent failure rate.

However, it is unclear whether the birth control failure at the Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary resulted from loss of the product or loss in implant efficacy. The association, however, recommends that the implants are routinely checked to ensure they are in place by palpation during training or scanning a transponder microchip placed within the implant.

Even though baby Astra will live his life in a safe environment socialising and playing, his parents and group mates did not have a peaceful start to life. Most of them are survivors of smuggling, bush meat trade, habitat loss from commercial logging and illegal wildlife trade.

Intended to be pets, some were chained up all day while others were confined to tiny cages in various countries. As a result, they lacked muscle development to climb and walk properly. Others were handed over by their owners for lifelong safekeeping after they grew big and uncontrollable. Chimpanzees kept as pets often suffer from both psychological and physical wounds. They frequently adopt unnatural behaviours in captivity such as begging for food by clapping their hands, spitting on people, or pacing due to boredom.

Many of these chimpanzees at the sanctuary still bear scars from encounters with bullets or snares.

Constrained to live in artificial environments, they endure trauma, leading to aggression, depression, or even psychosis.

There are other apes that are often captured in the wild and smuggled to distant locations to serve as entertainment in commercial zoos and safari parks. Their fate, upon ageing, mirrors that of pet chimpanzees.

“This sanctuary started in 1993 through an agreement with Jane Goodall Institute and the Kenya Wildlife Service. The main goal was to rescue chimps who were victims of the civil unrest in Burundi. Other than that, we have chimps that were rescued from smugglers. Some were rescued at JKIA on transit, and a few people have surrendered chimps to us for their life-long care from Iran, Iraq and other countries,” explains Dr Muthoni.

In 1995, another group of nine adult chimpanzees joined the sanctuary, followed by an additional 10 in 1996. Over time, the sanctuary's scope expanded, now accepting chimpanzees rescued from distressing circumstances worldwide. Currently, it protects 30 chimpanzees.

“Immediately they get here, we have a quarantine facility where they stay for three months. We conduct tests, vaccinate them, and try to understand their personality and trauma patterns, which may range from food traumas, where they tend to binge eat, or loud sounds. Caregivers help them address their trauma, and then they are slowly introduced to a group. That also involves a lot of research to know which group they would better fit in and if there is a surrogate mother who can take them in, depending on age and gender.

“Being in a semi-captive facility, they are quite intelligent animals and you have to keep them engaged — keep them doing things they would be naturally doing in the wild such as foraging termite mounds, digging for termites, using sticks, swinging from trees, among others. This can take like a year or two,” she adds.

Every morning, Ms Muthoni and her team leave their campsites and go to the chimpanzee nighttime holding facilities to check on them and ensure they have woken up well. The team then releases them for breakfast and clean their sleeping facilities. The chimps are released into their enclosures, where they spend the rest of their day browsing.

“They come back for lunch at around noon, and then go back again. In the evening, they go back to the holding facility for the night. Chimps in the wild are almost omnivorous like us. They eat meat, fruits and plants. Here, we do mainly fruits and non-meat-based proteins. We also mix eggs with some of their foods, but other than that they eat fruits, vegetables and peanuts. We have also set up termite mounts so they can dig for termites outside.”

Besides serving as a rescue centre, the sanctuary also serves as a platform for raising awareness about chimpanzees in their natural habitats. Unfortunately , the chimps in the sanctuary cannot be reintroduced to the wild. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora has declared wild chimpanzees as threatened and endangered, and in need of utmost protection. This declaration means that it is illegal for chimpanzees to be used for entertainment, to be captured, killed or traded commercially.

Despite efforts to protect them, thousands of great apes vanish from their natural habitats annually due to illegal trade. Conservatively, experts believe that a minimum of 2,000 chimps fall victim to trafficking each year. Shockingly, for every live baby chimp caught up in illegal trade, up to 10 other chimpanzees may have perished in the process.

'Let's disrupt!' How Dr Wanjiru Rutenberg shattered global glass ceilings,"At the tender age of 14, Wanjiru Kamau embarked on a life-changing journey. Her parents, with grand aspirations for their eldest child, made a pivotal decision – to send her to the foreign land of Denver, Colorado, in the United States.

It was a time when winter's chill had enveloped the city, but Wanjiru had no choice but to adapt to her new surroundings.

Her host, an uncle who was a surgeon, promptly enrolled her in a public school, where she experienced a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities.

This exposure and interaction with multiracial student body opened Wanjiru's eyes to the lost opportunities for her people in Africa, particularly in her home country, Kenya. It instilled in her a burning desire to pay it forward.

True to her parents' dreams, Wanjiru did not disappoint. At the age of 30, she returned home as Dr Wanjiru Kamau – and married, taking on the name Dr Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg.

Her accomplishments brought immense joy to her father, a retired electrical engineer from Kenya Airways, and her mother, a former employee of the Teachers Service Commission.

Throughout her higher education journey, Wanjiru was fortunate to receive a scholarship that covered her undergraduate and postgraduate studies. She earned a degree in politics from Whitman College and seamlessly transitioned to the University of Minnesota, where she completed her master's and doctoral degrees in political science.

“I wanted to be a lawyer like Martha Karua.  I also admired James Orengo (Siaya Governor), and (Prof) Anyang’ Nyong’o (Kisumu Governor) who is also a political scientist,” she shares.

However, financial constraints as a foreign student in the US led her to pursue political science, as it offered funding for her doctoral studies.

“Then I wanted to do public policy, and I ran into the same problem.  Then I discovered if I did political science, they would actually pay so long as I told them I was going to get a PhD. If I told them I only needed a Master’s, they would make me pay but if I told them I was signing up for the PhD, they would pay my fees and a monthly stipend to be a teaching assistant.”

But this daughter of Kamau, the man who raised her to know she can do anything in this world, has indeed held high-flying global positions so parallel to her training.

Global initiative

From her role as director at the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (Award), where she expanded its range and diversity of partners, to her position as an executive in-residence at Schmidt Futures, where she designed and built a global initiative for Black women senior leaders, her impact has been far-reaching.

Her work has also extended to several boards and advisory councils of organisations investing in agriculture, climate change, environment, philanthropic work, human development, and social ventures, including the African Climate Foundation, Centre for Development Research, Wangari Maathai Foundation, Bridge Collaborative, and New Economy Venture Accelerator, among others.

In the past four months alone, she has been appointed to significant positions, including a senior fellowship at the Ford Foundation and a seat on the executive board of the global Crop Trust, which implements the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.

I ask her how she cracked it.

Wanjiru attributes it to her curiosity and unwavering determination. ""Political science just gave me a degree. But kuwa kimbelembele na kichwa ngumu (being curious and firm-minded) has landed me most places I've landed,"" she says.

""Kichwa ngumu is that you can't tell me, I can't do this. Kimbelembele is kwani? (Why not?). What is this thing? How hard can this thing be?""

Wanjiru recognises that her kichwa ngumu and kimbelembele mind-set stem from a gender perspective.

""There is a way we tend to raise girls; we tell them to be demure, sit quietly, and wait to be invited. I'm grateful to my parents, especially my dad; he never did that to me. My dad never looked at me and said that you can't do that, that's for boys. So, fathers play a massive role in the lives of their daughters,"" she reckons.

“Now I have two sons, and I convince them that they can do it. Whatever it is, just go try. Others have done it, and if they haven’t, then you will be the first one to do it.”

One thing that deeply bothers Wanjiru is wasted talent.

""We waste humans in the stupidest of ways, and I really hate it. So, everything I've done is 'how can we stop wasting humans?'"" she says.

""We waste humans because they are poor, because of racism, patriarchy, class. Every job I find myself doing is around that.""

This sentiment is at the core of Akili Dada, a leadership incubator for young women and girls that Wanjiru founded 20 years ago.

""I started Akili Dada when I was only 26 years old. It was very much based on my own experiences. At that age, I was finishing up my PhD, which I obtained at 30 – a crucial milestone for me before having my child. All my education was based on scholarships. People were investing in me; I also wanted to invest in young people, and that was a big motivator for starting Akili Dada,"" she explains.

""Let them call you outspoken - then level up"": Dr Wanjiru's daring advice to women.

Wanjiru's degrees in political science, with a focus on Kenya's transition to democracy, fuelled her interest in nurturing the next generation of women leaders.

Inspired by trailblazers like Martha Karua and Linah Kilimo, she questioned, ""What are we doing with the next generation of leaders? Are we preparing them? We have to be intentional in preparing them. You get better quality leaders if you're intentional in preparing them.

So, Akili Dada was 'how do we, as a country, not lose talent in terms of really bright girls from poor families?'""

Starting with a scholarship program, Akili Dada expanded into a comprehensive initiative working with girls and young women aged 13-35. ""

""The key pillars of the program were access to education, support in the form of mentoring and building intergenerational relationships, as well as experiential learning and leadership,"" Wanjiru says.

During the December holidays, the girls would receive grants of Ksh 3,000 ($22.59) to Ksh5,000 ($37.65) to start community projects in their home areas.

""The project was the beginning of getting them to practice being responsible over communal resources. If you don't start with small responsibilities, then one day when you're in charge of the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), my friend, you'll see smoke. So, can we start training leaders at the high school level and give them responsibilities over their community resources and see how they grow in that responsibility over time?"" she explains.

Although Wanjiru exited Akili Dada just one month shy of its 10-year anniversary, she remains proud of the organisation's continued success.

""When I left, I left. I've never sat on the board. They call me if they have questions, and if I have potential funders, I connect them. I'm really proud of how they have continued to run the organisation,"" she says.

Nineteen years after founding Akili Dada, Dr Wanjiru is on a new mission: to elevate and empower Black women across the world who have reached senior levels of management.

In September 2022, she launched Black Women in Executive Leadership (B-Wel).

""B-Wel's ambition and mission are bigger. The scope is global, and we are doing three things; connecting Black senior female leaders around the world into a community of mutual support. Because racism and patriarchy combined is another, like a tough combination, we are connecting them to share strategies, tools, and tactics that are proving successful as you navigate that intersection of patriarchy and anti-Black racism,"" she explains.

""We are also collecting and curating Black women's wisdom on how to navigate that intersection. We are curating not just for Black women but for others to learn how to navigate global oppressive systems.""

""The third thing we are doing is catalysing collaboration for change. For instance, we have a partnership with the New York Stock Exchange, where we are working to increase the number of Black women serving on the boards of listed companies. We are also partnering with some of the leading executive search firms in the world, the ones that hire CEOs, and we can help them identify a diverse group of candidates and help the Black women position themselves for executive careers.

They are, however, working in a challenging environment when the anti-black movement is threatening any developments aimed at emancipating the black population.

""It's challenging to discuss Black issues, especially in the US where our donors Her strength comes from inner power and daily talks with God, asking the Creator to make her useful. Failure to her is ""not fulfilling my purpose on this planet"" - something she deeply cares about.

During her ""numerous internships"" in good and bad organisations, she found purpose.

Well, in her “tonne of internships,” she did find some purpose.  The purpose to be useful and make a difference in the lives of others.

African scientists

“I’d say, if I ever do this, I do it differently. You see things done badly and you see things done well and if you tell yourself, if I ever get a chance, I’ll do this differently. If a chance finds you, you’ve already decided how you will do it,” she says.

At Award, she transformed it into a pan-African organisation recognised across the continent.

“I took an organisation that didn’t have the deepest connection with partners of the continent and turned it into a pan-African organisation where we walked into the room, and people would recognise us. We raised nearly $40 million for African scientists. I also designed gender and climate change fellowship programs,"" she says proudly.

Joining the Ford Foundation as a senior fellow is a ""tremendous honour as the first Kenyan in this very senior role."" She says she'll use it to advance B-Well's work and contribute to the foundation's mission.

As she empowers women, she warns against suppression.

""Don't let anyone call you too kimbelembele (outspoken); that's their problem. Let them level up.""

She sees Kenya's failure to pass the two-thirds gender law after 14 years as ""political cowardice.""

""It will eventually pass. With balanced perspectives, we could've solved some national issues sooner.""

Those who know her describe her as self-driven and resolute once she sets her mind.

“She is self-driven and believes in justice and equity,” says Peter Irungu, says Peter Irungu, her B-Well co-conceptualiser.

“She’ll say ‘Let’s not just accept the way things are. Let’s disrupt and let’s think a little harder of what’s possible outside of what we’ve been told is possible.”

He reaffirms that B-Well was born to address the barriers Black women have to manoeuvre to reach the executive level and remain there.

“""We thought, 'How can we address that? A fellowship with mentorship, coaching, and a transnational experience?'"" Irungu says.

Joy Zawadi of Akili Dada is inspired by Dr Wanjiru's ""confidence and vision to change communities"" and recognition that ""this continent won't change unless you challenge the status quo.""

She notes that Dr Wanjiru’s exit left a legacy: “leadership isn’t sitting somewhere for 50 to 60 years holding onto power.”

How Optica has stayed in the eye wear business since 1959,"How far can a founder's vision take a business? For Optica, arguably Kenya's biggest eye wear retailer, it has been 65 years, which makes it one of the oldest businesses in the country.

It all started with the late Bharat Bhardwaj, an optometrist working at the King George VI Hospital (today Kenyatta National Hospital). It troubled him that his patients had very limited options in terms of affordable eye care. They would get prescriptions from him but struggled to buy decent spectacles.

Then he had a vision.

Why not go into business and offer comprehensive optical care service? Instead of seeing him at the hospital and getting a prescription only to go hunt for affordable eye wear, Bharat reasoned his patiens would get more value for their money if he combined the two services.

He opened the first shop in 1959 on Nairobi's Government Road, now Moi Avenue.

“Back then, people had little knowledge about the optical industry and eye care. The knowledge and experience Bharat Bhardwaj brought helped a great deal in shaping the industry into what it is today,” says Wazeem Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of Optica Kenya.

From the Moi Avenue shop, Optica has grown into 78 branches locally, four in Uganda and two in Rwanda.

What is the secret to the family business' longevity while so many others have faltered before handing the reins to the third generation?

Handling transition

Wazeem says for starters Optica got the transitions right. When a corporate structure was required to get to the next growth level, the family was quick to hire professionals from outside to play key management roles.

In his case, Optica tapped him from the London School of Economics to join the firm in 2013. He reports to the company board chaired by Bharat Bhardwaj's son, Kush.

This transition, according to Wazeem, was a pivotal moment because professional outsiders bring objectivity and add value.

Secondly, Wazeem says Optica has stayed true to the founder's vision, with a strong focus on the customer which has helped it build its brand as a reliable retailer for quality affordable eye wear.

“It did not suddenly emerge. It is an accumulated experience over the years but that doesn’t mean we have been complacent,” he says.

Optica, he notes, works hard to give a specific customer experience which is replicated across all their shops.

“Growth and scaling up bring advantages, and we pass those advantages on to our customers, hence the reason we can offer frames for as low as Sh890, and with that, customer appreciation grows instead of diminishing.”

Cost points and risks

Thirdly, Wazeem points out that in retail businesses like Optica’s, rent is a significant overhead cost alongside human capital expenditure.

By keeping a close eye on the expenditures, the company, he says, ensures a smooth operation.

“The current hard economic time is a risk element we cannot control. We are always looking at policies on the regulatory aspect; taxes changing interests rates, among others,” says Wazeem.

Young workforce

Wazeem says that reliance on a young workforce for businesses today is crucial and that the more a business is geared towards utilising the young workforce, the better it can respond to market requirements.

“Business needs that because naturally, everything at any given time will revolve around people of a certain demography. Ours is mixed though younger segment forms our largest segment,” he says.

Choosing location

At 78 branches locally and still growing, Wazeem says that Optica’s growth and branch locations and selection revolve around areas where the firm’s presence and services are required.

“We look at locations with the absence of credible opticians, and it is more than a business decision. We choose locations where customers will appreciate them, and naturally, that, brings business traction,” says the CEO.

He adds that Optica also picks areas with new property development that allows for customer accessibility and, at the same time, the presence of other retailers.

Funding expansion

The former banker says that to fund its growth and branch expansion, Optica solely relies on its internally generated revenue at its current strength.

“The revenue generated is heavily re-invested in network expansion,” he emphasises, adding that this step doesn’t happen overnight but rather is well planned because items like training of operational staff before deployment, shop remodelling, and equipment sourcing can affect cash flow if not well managed.

Lessons along the way

To have maintained a strong brand for six decades, Wazeem says that their secret lies in their core values of remaining consistent on their objective.

“When businesses grow and start seeing returns, they sometimes tend to lose focus, but businesses need a strong focus, and that’s what we have to do,” he advises.

He further adds that in retail, one key element you have to rely on is the workforce and that if they are motivated, they, in turn, pass that motivation on to customers, resulting in better output and consistency.

“Understanding the needs of your shopper is equally important. One of the reasons family businesses may be limited in growth beyond a certain level is that they may have ambition but achieving those ambitions and aspirations requires vision and a plan,” says Wazeem.

He advises that to achieve sustained growth, businesses should embrace change, and for them, the way Optica operates today is totally different from how it operated 65 years ago.

Land investment: How to avoid the dead capital trap,"Branice Wanjiru had gone to her Sacco offices to check how much money she had in savings when she stumbled on quarter-acre parcels of land being sold in Kitengela, Kajiado County.

“The sacco officials told me that there was land they were selling cheaply. They marketed it with the impression of an excellent investment in a developed area closer to the road and not far from Kitengela town,” she says.

She envisioned building her retirement home on this land.

“I decided to hold on to it because the value would go up. I didn’t second-guess myself or do due diligence of visiting the land before I committed my Sh700,000. It was also at a time when I had some loose money and I was on the lookout for somewhere to invest it. I thought that it would be of no use if I just put the money in the bank,” she tells the BDLife.

True to her trust, Ms Wanjiru kept postponing her visit to the land. The sacco had issued her with a title deed, so she knew her investment was solid. A year and a half later, she decided to tour the place.

“I was on leave and I needed money so I went there to weigh options of selling it. I didn’t even know where the land was located, I had to ask the Sacco for directions,” she recalls.

Land speculation has been preferred by many as the route to wealth. Many older Kenyans store their wealth in land, hoping to sell them in hard times. Some strike gold as the land appreciates especially if they bought in an underdeveloped area that then grows fast, roads come up and shopping centres.

Others are not so lucky, as they have to sell at a loss especially when they need the money urgently and if the location takes long to urbanise.

“When I reached there, I found my land was in the middle of nowhere. It took me three hours to locate it. I had to park my car very far before proceeding to the slopes on a motorcycle. Luckily it wasn’t raining as much, but I wondered how my sloppy land located at the bottom would look,” Ms Wanjiru exhales as she narrates her disappointment.

The land that she had been sold for was in a riparian (adjacent to rivers and streams).

“I was so disappointed. It’s difficult to even put a structure there. I knew it would be a difficult task to convince anyone to buy that land so I asked the seller whether they were willing to take it back and just refund my money but they were reluctant since they did not have buyers,” she says.

Land is not a bad investment, financial experts say. But when it is dead capital then it is a bad investment. A majority of Kenyans buy land but find it hard to turn them into money-generating ventures because they are either too small, too far or the owners lack capital.

Joyce Gituro, who also bought a 50 X 100 parcel of land, saw it as a speculative investment. She was told about the land by a friend. It is in Mastoo in Juja, Kiambu County, close to the then-proposed bypass road. She was convinced that it was a good idea.

“I went for that particular parcel of land because of the proposed bypass road that was to be built connecting Kangundo Road and Thika Road. I knew the value would double with time,” she says.

Thinking of how much the land would fetch in a few years she paid Sh800,000. The long wait that started in 2016 finally came to an end. She is lucky though. The land has doubled in price but searching for a buyer has not been an easy ride.

“I want to sell the piece of land because I have an ongoing project that requires more money and the returns are good, also given that the land value has appreciated twice its price,” she says.

Ms Gituro says finding a buyer was hard because development in the area has been slow. The proposed bypass was also never built.

“The challenge of selling this piece is due to accessibility, the roads are very bad. There are no schools, the nearest one is quite a distance away. There is also an issue of title deeds, though I have the share certificate in my name,” she says, “the proposed bypass would have changed everything about that area. It wasn’t a bad investment if everything had fallen in place.”

For Ms Wanjiru, she says hers was a bad investment decision.

“That land could have cost no more than Sh250,000. To be honest, if I can get someone to just refund my money because with land you cannot rush you will either get a buyer or not,” she says.

What should someone consider before investing in land?

Land investment is like a commodity, whether you choose to invest in it or not. The higher the population growth, the more valuable it becomes.

Johnson Nderi, an independent consultant and corporate finance expert, says if you can manage the risk of acquisition, land is generally a good investment in terms of its store of value.

“One of the problems with holding cash is that it can be eroded by things like inflation. As inflation diminishes, land appreciates on the other side. It is a good hedge against inflation because it tends to acquire higher than inflation rate valuation,” he says.

When it comes to credibility, Mr Nderi insists on working with a good conveyancing lawyer. A lawyer who understands the risks you may face and has a way of eliminating them. The process protects you from being scammed.

“The main risk would be buying a bad asset and they can help you with the due diligence. Factors like the location of the land, make it prone to land invasion. For the transaction process, does the property belong to the seller, Are there multiple legal frameworks for the property?”

In addition, as an investor, you should understand the basics, which include a survey. Take time to research the property you want to buy and don't be in a hurry as it can turn into an investment nightmare.

Do not follow the crowd, John Monyoncho, a financial adviser said at an investor education conference held in Nairobi recently.

“Everything we invest in is risky, but be aware of risks before paying. Understand what you are investing in and where you are investing. Applied knowledge is power,” he says.

Moses Wetang’ula’s push to unite Western rattles ODM chiefs,"National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula appears to have renewed his bid to consolidate Western region by reaching out to opposition politicians in a series of meetings.

Mr Wetang’ula hosted a section of ODM Members of County Assembly (MCAs) from the region at his Bungoma home on Monday.

The meeting, which was also attended by some of the opposition MPs from the region, has rattled ODM leader Raila Odinga, who has since threatened disciplinary action against the members who attended the meeting.

Nation has established that at least 10 ODM MCAs were in attendance after Mr Wetang’ula invited all MCAs from Busia, Kakamega, Bungoma and Vihiga County Assemblies.

ODM, through its Executive Director Oduor Ong’wen, had in a letter dated May 29 warned the MCAs against attending the meeting.

Informal invitation

“The ODM party has been informed of an informal invitation to some or all of you by the Leader of Ford Kenya Party, Moses Wetang’ula, to a meeting on or around June 3, 2024 at his home in Kabuchai, and whose agenda is unknown to us,” said Mr Ong’wen.

“I am instructed by the party leadership to inform you that attendance of such a meeting shall be subject to the ODM constitution Article 12 (1) (c) and lead to being deemed to have resigned from party membership,” the party warned.

Lugari MP Nabii Nabwera (ODM), who serves as Western Parliamentary Caucus’ chairman, and has been crucial in organising some of the recent meetings graced by Mr Wetang’ula, denied knowledge of the Monday engagement with the MCAs.

“I am not aware of the meeting between the Speaker and ODM MCAs,” said the MP.

But credible sources within ODM and Mr Wetang’ula’s office confirmed that the meeting took place with about three ODM MPs in attendance.

Mr Wetang’ula appears to be exploiting the resignation of Prime Cabinet Secretary (PCS) Musalia Mudavadi as Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader, which has made him less active in local and party politics.

On January 29, Mr Wetang’ula held a meeting with Western Kenya MPs drawn from across the political divide at Keekorok Lodge Masai Mara, lifting the lid on his behind-the-scenes manoeuvres to rally the leaders around him.

Political undertones

Although described as a ‘routine’ caucus of Western Kenya MPs, the meeting had political undertones after some politicians perceived to be close to Mr Mudavadi and Mr Odinga skipped it.

Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba, who doubles up as ANC Secretary General, did not attend the meeting. Vihiga Senator Godfrey Osotsi, a close ally of Mr Odinga, also gave the meeting a wide berth.

The meeting was attended by MPs Oscar Nabulindo (Matungu), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero), Ferdinand Wanyonyi (Kwanza), Martin Pepela (Webuye), Patrick Simiyu (Cherangany), Elsie Mahanda (Kakamega), Geoffrey Mulanya (Nambale), John Walukhe (Sirisia) and Fred Ikana (Shinyalu).

Others who were in the meeting were Joshua Oyula (Butula), Dick Oyugi (Luanda), Johnson Naika (Mumias West), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Immanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), John Chikati (Tongaren), John Makali (Kanduyi), Innocent Mugabe (Likuyani), Benard Shinali (Ikolomani), Clement Sloya (Sabatia), Titus Khamala (Lurambi), Oku Kaunya (Teso North), Nabii Nabwera (Lugari), Majimbo Kalasinga (Kabuchai), Didmus Barasa (Kimilili) and Bungoma Senator Wafula Wakoli.

During President William Ruto’s visit in the region in February, Mr Wetang’ula disclosed how he has been rallying leaders from the region to unite and work as a team.

Olunga: Cote d’Ivoire not on our minds for now,"Harambee Stars captain Michael Olunga has warned his teammates against complacency when they face Burundi’s Swallows in a Group 'F' 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi on Friday.

The match will kick off at 4pm Kenyan time and will be broadcast live on national station KBC.

“We respect Cote d'Ivoire as they are African champions but Burundi is also a tough opponent which we must deal with first,"" said Olunga on phone from Lilongwe on Thursday.

""Everybody is talking about Cote d'Ivoire and underrating Burundi which has the same style of play like us and is strong opponent. We should tackle them with a lot of respect,” he added.

Kenya will face group favourites Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday at the same venue.

Football Kenya Federation moved Harambee Stars' home fixtures to Lilongwe's Bingu stadium is because the only venues that could these international matches were MISC and Nyayo Stadium which are currently closed for renovations.

Impressive run

Incidentally, Malawi will be hosting Sao Tome at the same venue on Thursday in a Group 'H' match.

Olunga said he Kenya will have to be at their best to prevail.

The Al-Duhail marksman added that the Malawians have been hospitable to them.

“We were received well in Malawi and our training has also been well. The team is adequately prepared to face Burundi, we will also be targeting a positive outcome against Cote d’Ivoire,” added the former Gor Mahia man.

Olunga heads into the two matches on the back of an impressive run of seven goals scored in Stars’ last three matches.

The former Gor Mahia and Tusker man scored a brace in their 5-0 World Cup qualifying rout of Seychelles on November 20 in Abidjan.

Olunga then helped himself to five goals in the Four Nations tournament held in Malawi in March where Kenya hammered Malawi 4-0 before thumping Zimbabwe 3-1 in the final on March 26.

Latest Fifa rankings

Midfielder John Ochieng said they will approach the match cautiously but “with a winning mentality”.

According to the latest Fifa rankings, Kenya are placed 33 places above Burundi at 107th.

In their eight meetings, Kenya have won three, Burundi two with three draws.

Stars have since Monday been training at Silver Stadium, which is a 10-minute drive from Bingu National Stadium.

Burkinabe Jean Quattara is the centre referee assisted by compatriots Seydou Tiama (first assistant referee), Habib Oumar Sanou (second assistant referee), and Benoit Bado (fourth official).

Tanzanian Leslie Liunda is the referee assessor while South African Bennett Kenneth Bailey will be the match commissioner.

Regular and VIP tickets will retail at 5,000 Malawian Kwacha (about Sh376) and 20,000 Malawian Kwacha (Sh1,500) respectively, and will be available on match day.

AI X-ray machines to boost TB diagnosis at Nakuru referral hospital,"The fight against tuberculosis (TB) at Nakuru Level Five Hospital, the largest hospital in South Rift region, has received a significant boost with the acquisition of a digital AI-enabled X-ray machine.

This advanced technology, the first of its kind in Nakuru, aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of TB diagnosis at the hospital, facilitating appropriate treatment.

The machine was acquired through support from the National TB Programme, the African Medical Research Foundation and Qure.ai, an AI solutions provider.

It is expected to revolutionise TB diagnosis by enhancing imaging accuracy through AI-supported tools and reducing turnaround time for patients.

The AI tools can read chest X-rays, assisting healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses. Radiologists, radiographers and clinical officers from the chest clinic and the hospital’s outpatient department have already been trained on the use of this technology.

Chest X-rays are a common method for screening and triaging people for TB and assessing lung damage. With AI, results are more precise and available within minutes, allowing health workers to quickly determine the next steps for TB care for patients.

""The technology will be a game changer at the facility that serves about six counties. Artificial Intelligence screens for TB more accurately, leading to improved treatment for patients. The AI-enabled X-ray machine will make things easier for doctors and patients and play an important role in TB treatment,"" Nakuru County Health Executive Roselyn Mungai said.

Eradication of TB in Africa has been challenging due to various social, economic, healthcare, and biological factors.

The co-infection of HIV/Aids and TB is a major challenge as it weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to TB and complicating the management of both diseases.

Limited access to healthcare due to poverty, the high cost of treatment, and the inability to maintain proper nutrition, which is crucial for TB recovery, have exacerbated the situation.

""Nakuru is now a step forward in the fight against TB, having tapped into the technology to provide automated interpretation of radiology exams like X-rays, CTs and ultrasound scans, enabling faster diagnosis and speedier treatment of the disease,"" said Ms Mungai.

Nakuru Level Five Hospital is now among eight facilities nationwide that have initiated the programme of Digital Chest X-ray (DCXR) with AI, introducing the new diagnostic tools in accordance with World Health Organization recommendations under the TB Programme supported by USAID through the STOP TB Partnership.

Tuberculosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Kenya. It affects all age groups, but has its greatest toll in the most productive age group of 15 to 44 years.

The major factor responsible for the large TB disease burden in Kenya is the concurrent HIV epidemic.



New tech to improve access to cardiac care in remote areas

Meanwhile, patients with heart disease in remote and outreach areas will have access to improved care through the use of a new technology that enables cardiologists to review patients' electrocardiogram (ECG) data even when they are far from the examining physician.

This follows a partnership between GE HealthCare, a global leader in healthcare technology, and Daktari Africa, a pioneering telemedicine platform, to support Kenya's National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases by helping clinicians better diagnose and treat cardiovascular disease.

The MUSE™ NX software, developed by GE HealthCare, allows for easy integration, enhanced security protection and rapid deployment of updates, ultimately supporting fast and accurate diagnoses.

With GE HealthCare's support, Daktari Africa will work with the Kiambu County government to implement the MUSE™ NX system in health centres across the county.

Following the installation of the MUSE™ NX system, the GE HealthCare team will provide training to Daktari Africa and its partners to ensure that healthcare professionals are equipped with the necessary skills to maximise the impact of the platform.

“This collaboration seeks to revolutionise cardiac care in Kenya by bringing advanced diagnostic capabilities to remote areas. Through tele-ECG screenings, we can facilitate early detection of critical conditions, reduce hospitalisations and improve patient outcomes. We are pleased to be working with GE HealthCare to make a positive impact on healthcare delivery in our country,"" said Dr Charles Kamotho, founder and CEO of Daktari Africa.

“By providing physicians with access to patient ECG information, the MUSE™ NX solution will support informed decision-making and high-quality care for a disease that is placing an increasing burden on the nation’s health system. By combining clinical expertise, telemedicine specialisation and advanced healthcare technologies, we can help save time in the diagnosis and treatment process, increase staff productivity and enhance patient care quality,"" said Moussa Gholmieh, general manager for Patient Care Solutions, Emerging Markets, GE HealthCare

According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of non-communicable disease mortality in the country.

Alternative justice system will end backlog of cases,"Kenya’s culturally rich communities proudly champion and practise their own forms of justice that are tethered to basic mechanisms and principles of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence.

This inherent system, customary or informal justice mechanisms, was the core of dispute resolutions as communities thrived with the constituents satisfied with how justice was dispensed.

At the onset of colonisation, most of these laws were considered retrogressive, archaic and outdated as the colonial master introduced those that he considered supreme but, in reality, were favourable to white settlers and punitive to indigenous peoples.

Pre-independence, vestiges of the colonial constitution formed part of independent Kenya’s laws, which also did not formally recognise informal justice systems. Following the 2010 Constitution, however, the country has strived to recognise some of these alternative justice systems (AJS) in line with the directive in Article 159(2)(c) of the Constitution, thus the development of the relevant policy.

Cultural issues

The Judiciary says 78 per cent of justice seekers in Kenya use mechanisms for justice that are outside the formal courts, proving that the mechanism are no longer regarded as ‘others’ or subordinate alternatives. The success of AJS is pegged on its people-centred approach to justice and also familiarity to addressing cultural issues with lasting solutions.

That AJS is considered a faster route to justice while also providing durable resolutions to disputes is among the reasons it continues to thrive.

The AJS policy strives to ensure that, to properly recognise, regulate and enhance its use, it must align its operation with the principles and values of the Constitution and international human rights standards. All this while underscoring the need for a pluralistic approach to justice that is sensitive to cultural, socioeconomic and geographical diversity of the nation.

Take, for instance, the Borana community, which is also spread in parts of southern Ethiopia. For centuries, it has relied on the Gada system to resolve major social, political and economic conflicts. The Adulaa Council is entrusted with upholding peace and harmony within the community.

Among the Somali, the Maslaha system has been used to resolve conflicts, hugely assisting in enhancing reconciliation and cohesion within the community. In recent years, however, it has been abused by some individuals in cases involving criminal matters such as murder and even rape or defilement.

Alternative dispute resolution

On this, there is a need to ensure alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms do not contravene available legal instruments that prescribe penalties for such offences. Also, it is important that victims are not denied their deserved justice.

Elders, the ultimate custodians of law within their communities, must be properly sensitised on the principles and values of the constitution and international human rights standards to fairly dispense justice when hearing and resolving cases. The same case with members of the community.

AJS has facilitated the resolution of disputes that would otherwise have burdened the formal courts, reducing the endemic backlog of cases. Concerted efforts should, however, also be put in sufficiently documenting the impact of AJS on justice outcomes and the administration of justice as the Judiciary continues to set up specialised centres countrywide.

Fix ailing health sector to ease Kenyans’ agony,"

Access to affordable quality healthcare is a right that every Kenyan is entitled to but which remains elusive due to lack of funds. The universal health coverage (UHC) is an idea the authorities have just been toying around with.

Since he took office well over a year ago, President William Ruto has given assurances on healthcare. His footprint is evident in the ongoing setting up of the Social Health Insurance Fund (Shif). It is expected to deliver where its predecessor, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which was perennially riddled with mismanagement and corruption issues, failed.

There is an acute shortage of essential medicines and key vaccines in public hospitals and health centres countrywide. It is very depressing that there is no HIV medication for children, as well as painkillers, antidepressants and antibiotics in these facilities on which the majority of Kenyans rely for their medical care. Critically ill patients lack life-saving drugs and treatment.

Ironically, this comes at a time when services are being restored following the end of a doctors’ strike that lasted more than 50 days. The medics may be back but they do not have what they need to save lives. Medicines needed for life-saving surgeries are also missing. While some patients who could have been saved had the doctors been at work ended up dying, the medics are now present but helpless.

All 47 counties ran out of drugs after Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) withheld supplies over a Sh3 billion debt. Also owed huge debts are international health organisations such as Global Alliance for Vaccines and immunisation (Gavi) and Unicef.

The assurance by Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha now says the hitch has been resolved and some drugs been imported while others are expected soon is welcome. However, the ailing health sector is a mockery of a nation where leaders routinely blow huge funds on foreign and domestic travel for their own convenience when patients are dying because there are no medicines in the taxpayer-funded public hospitals.

This calls for urgent measures to curb the widespread suffering. The top leaders must urgently reset national priorities

Road to UHC: The elephant in the room when it comes to Social Health Insurance Act in Kenya,"The gazettement of the Social Health Insurance Act regulations signalled that Kenya’s UHC train was on the move. There were some key issues raised during public participation that were incorporated and others were not.

Households with salaried income would contribute monthly contributions of 2.75 percent was not capped at the proposed Sh5,000 as initially expected. The contribution shall not be less than Sh300 with remittance being done by the ninth day of every month including public service and county employees.

Whereas a household whose income is not derived from salaried employment shall contribute to the Social Health Insurance Fund (Shif) annually at a rate of 2.75 percent of the household income as determined by the means testing instrument prescribed in the regulations.

Why Kenyans are worried about the UHC rollout

Why Kenyans are worried about the UHC rollout

The means testing, put simply would be an exercise to determine household composition and socio-economic aspects. One epidemiologist referred to it as “similar to a census only shorter”, focused on the determination and estimation of the household income for the payment of the premiums set out in the regulations.

Some experts have queried funding mechanisms to conduct the means testing exercise and will they leverage existing databases, particularly at the county level?

Nevertheless, the National Assembly would be able to appropriate funds for indigents (those who can’t pay as can’t afford necessities), vulnerable persons and persons under lawful custody.

Biometrics capture

Kenyans would, however, have to register anew including biometrics capture for both contributors and beneficiaries above 7 years old. All those above 18 years old would be expected to register as contributors. Those under 21 years old with no income or under 25 years old but enrolled in an institute of learning could remain as beneficiaries.

Kenyans Want to hear about services under UHC

Kenyans Want to hear about services under UHC

There were set guidelines involving the three funds that make up the Social Health Insurance Act, that is, the Primary Healthcare Fund, Shif and Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund.

The simplest is the government allocation or tax-funded Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund which would include contracted ambulance services. A shortlist of healthcare cases that would be considered emergencies from heart attacks to seizures was provided. Any accredited facility would be required to provide both resuscitation and stabilization services to any Shif member for a maximum of 24 hours. Members with chronic conditions would first utilize the benefits under Shif and once they exhaust their limits, could then access services under the Chronic fund.

The Primary Healthcare fund would cover care in healthcare facilities designated, levels 2 to 4. The essentials of Primary Healthcare Networks come into play as one starts with the lower-level facility and only presents to a higher-level facility upon receiving a referral note, apart from emergency services. How then would members know the facility levels? Previously, NHIF required members to select their nearest facility.

Why rural hospitals in Kenya have stopped accepting NHIF cards

SHIF, being the only contributory fund of the three would cater for services in levels 4 to 6 facilities which included specialized services. An excellent provision here is Mental Health and Palliative Services being covered.

Two crucial questions remain, ‘What would be the benefits?’ Following a member’s contribution what services would be covered and to what extent? The list of interventions to be included in the benefits package is still being discussed, by the Benefits Package and Tariffs Advisory Panel. On the other end of the spectrum, ‘What would healthcare facilities and providers be paid (Tariffs) for rendering these services?’.

The regulations clearly stated that the contributions made to the National Hospital Insurance Fund would be transferred to Shif and all data would be retained till all claims are settled to healthcare providers. In the next column, we discuss concerns facilities and providers have with regard to UHC.

Adopt a bicycle for good health,"June 3 was the World Bicycle Day, which the United Nations General Assembly started celebrating in 2018. Its purpose is to educate the public on the benefits of cycling to health and the environment.

Exercise riding is the bicycle itself. Due to the advent of motorised vehicles, where the pollution has also increased, the physical exercise of man has also ended. Besides being pollution-free, cycling is helpful in obesity reduction and weight control.

In today’s fast-paced life, everybody wants to reach their destination in the blink of an eye. So, we left bicycles and started using motorised vehicles.

In earlier times, most people either walked or used bicycles. Because of that, they were physically active and fit. But as urbanisation increased, cycling also declined significantly. Most people own a car, whose excessive use harms the environment and health.

Bicycle rallies

When we get sick in the cycle of living a busy and ostentatious life, doctors advise us to do bicycle exercises. Then we spend money to ride a gym bike or use the treadmill. Why don’t we ride a bicycle for at least one hour a day, before the doctors tell us to?

Even in the olden times, the bicycle was considered a very important tool, especially because it was the most widely affordable and easiest way of transportation for people and goods. Bicycles were used by almost everyone—from farmers to students. For the poor, it was the main means of commute, by which they could easily go to work and school.

On World Bicycle Day, many local bicycle clubs and groups organise bicycle rallies and trips. Special programmes are organised to educate the youth about the benefits of bicycles. Bicycle races and competitions are held. This is not a one-day event but a long-term effort to promote cycling.

Is muguka debate founded on ignorance?,"The discussion about muguka, a variety of khat, is healthy, albeit skewed. It should be a national debate, not a regional dispute. Regulatory bodies such as Parliament and Nacada have failed. There should also be a national policy containing the rules and regulations of the produce.

And if it is proved to cause more detrimental than helpful to Kenyans, the farmers can venture into other economic activities. Lastly, the debate should be expanded to other legal but detrimental drugs, like cheap spirits.

Michael Kinuthia, Nairobi* * *Even as the court lifted the ban on muguka trade, it is the responsibility of the coast residents to determine its fate. The consumers know its merits and demerits.

Coast governors have played their part well by showing concern for the people. But the counties should accord job opportunities to the young idlers to lessen their chances of drug abuse.

Roselyne Karisa, Mombasa

* * *

The controversial varieties of khat (Catha edulis) are predominantly grown in Meru (miraa) and Embu (muguka) counties. They are legal, categorised as crops. So, in the meeting to ban muguka, did the coast leaders invite an analyst to explain to them through the science? Terming it as a harmful drug should be backed by scientific proof.

Let the leaders first eradicate drug and substance abuse.

Curb theft of donor funds,"A task force formed by the government to ensure prudent use of donor funds should hit the ground running. This is a long-overdue bid to restore donors’ confidence in their funds being put to the intended uses. Comprising government officials and representatives of the donors, their brief is straightforward and there should be no dilly-dallying.

There is a need to enhance accountability in the management of these substantive funds provided for projects to improve the lives of disadvantaged Kenyans. The commitment of Sh2.6 trillion to some 256 projects in various parts of the country confirms the desire of the foreign well-wishers to complement the government’s development efforts.

The donors could have used this money in their own countries but, in a show of solidarity and cooperation, opt to assist Kenyans to initiate useful programmes. This is why it is only fair that donors are assured that their money will be put to the intended use.

This is also an opportunity to reduce government bureaucracy and enable expeditious rollout of projects. Quite welcome, too, is an agreement to create a mechanism to prepare the country to deal with disasters such as the recent heavy rains and floods and starvation and famine in the drought-prone areas.

National Treasury Principal Secretary Chris Kiptoo admits that the implementation of donor-funded projects has been hampered by numerous challenges, including low absorption of funds, court disputes and outright mismanagement. But the donors are still keen on increased co-operation.

The opacity that envelopes donor-funded projects often makes accountability difficult and yet there is misappropriation and outright theft. This must be stopped.

However, the government should not interfere in the NGOs’ funding of projects. The organisations should have a free hand to conduct their business as long as they are transparent.

Collaboration and innovation key to housing,"In Kenya, owning a home is seen as a lifetime achievement, a symbol of stability and success. Yet the country grapples with a persistent housing crisis. With a deficit of over two million units, the sector would have to supply at least 250,000 houses annually for some four years to bridge the gap.

While traditional home ownership models have long been the cornerstone of the housing dream, a more nuanced approach is needed.

The deficit is dire in major urban centres and is attributed to urbanisation and a growing population. Conventional home ownership often requires substantial upfront capital or lengthy mortgage or financing processes, locking out the majority low- and middle-income earners. The traditional rigid climb to full home ownership is no longer the only option. Rethinking the “home ownership ladder” requires looking beyond a single path.

Smaller loans

Emerging approaches to address housing affordability challenges include innovative rent-to-own schemes, where tenants build equity gradually to eventually own a home. Micro-mortgages provide smaller loans designed for those with limited income. Phased construction allows the building of a home in stages. Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company (KMRC) offers concessional, fixed long-term mortgages, further reducing the financial burden.

Combined, these approaches can create a more accessible housing market for Kenyans with diverse financial realities. Most Kenyans invest in land for speculation rather than developing it, creating ‘dead capital’. These investments tie up capital in undeveloped land, which remains unused for long periods, contributing little to addressing the immediate housing needs of the population. Developing these lands into habitable spaces can significantly alleviate the housing shortage.

Prefabricated construction

Innovative construction technologies, such as aluminium formwork or prefabricated construction, can make home ownership more attainable by reducing construction costs and time. By using new building technologies, developers can put up a house quicker with greatly improved quality and at lower cost. These technologies, which are environmentally friendly with reduced material wastage, not only ensure durability and quality but also make large-scale projects feasible, providing a practical solution to the housing deficit.

The government has a critical role in facilitating these new models—including streamlining regulations, enhancing tax incentives to developers driving the affordable housing agenda and developing infrastructure in underserved areas.

Besides, collaboration between financial institutions, developers and other relevant industry players can create innovative financing solutions and unlock the potential of these alternative models.

Redefining home ownership is not just about bricks and mortar but creating inclusive and sustainable communities. Fostering collaboration and embracing innovative solutions can bridge the housing gap and ensure access to decent and affordable homes for all.

Three more bodies exhumed in Shakahola as State suspends exercise,"Three bodies were on Wednesday exhumed in the Shakahola forest as the government suspended the exercise until Tuesday.

The total number of bodies that have been exhumed since last year now stands at 446.

The multi-agency team dug out the three bodies in three different areas which were part of the 50 graves sites identified for the search of remains of victims believed to have been followers of a cult linked to preacher Paul Mackenzie.

In the morning, detectives did not manage to get any bodies in the three suspected graves before extending their search to different areas deep in the vast forest where they recovered the three bodies.

According to sources within the multi-agency team, matching DNA might be more complicated for the remains exhumed in the ongoing fifth phase considering the state of decomposition.

“Most of the remains recovered on Wednesday were skeletons, an indication the bodies were buried more than two years ago,” said the source.

On Tuesday, government chief pathologist Johansen Odour confirmed the challenge the government is facing in preserving the bodies as the makeshift morgue at the Malindi sub-County hospital premises continues to fill up at a fast rate.

Dr Odour said families failing to come out to assist in the identification of the bodies remains a big challenge.

“Out of the 429 bodies exhumed in the previous four phases, 32 bodies of those exhumed have been released to their relatives for burial while others are yet to be claimed.

""We are asking more people who suspect their relatives might have disappeared from Shakahola to come out for DNA matching since the government has acquired adequate reagents to speed up the identification exercise,” Dr Odour said.

With bodies found buried less than 2 feet underground, the detectives suspect that the bodies were buried in haste.

At the 4,000-acre forest, the area remains abandoned and under tight security as it is still a crime scene and a disturbed area as gazetted by the government.

GSU officers have established camps with regular patrols conducted to keep off anyone from entering the forest sitting on the vast Chakama ranch.

"Rhonex Kipruto handed six years ban, stripped off 10km world record","Kenya’s Rhonex Kipruto will lose his 2019 world 10,000m bronze medal and the 10km world record from 2020 after he was handed a six-year ban for  doping.

Kipruto’s result from September 2018 will henceforth be expunged and will only remain with the world under-20 10,000m title from July 2018 in Tampere, Finland.

Kipruto’s ban came a day after the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) provisionally suspended 33 Kenyan athletes for various doping offences.

It also came nine days after AIU also banned Kenya’s Josephine Chepkoech for seven years as a repeat offender and for the use of a prohibited substance Testosterone.

Chepkoech, 35, could have been given eight years as a repeat offender, having been suspended back in 2012 but AIU reduced the sentence by one year after admission of the offence.

The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) moved swiftly to effect the tough sanction against the 24-year-old promising distance athlete after a Disciplinary Tribunal threw away his appeal and ruled that there were irregularities in his Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) resulting from doping.

Kipruto was provisionally suspended on May 11, last year for violating the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules (ADR)  after irregularities were detected in his ABP dating back to July 2018.

He is now banned until May 10, 2029 and will have some top honours disqualified.

However, Kipruto has the liberty to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

A statement from AIU indicated that after considering submissions from experts, the tribunal rejected Kipruto’s defence, concluding the “cause for the abnormalities in the ABP is more likely to be due to blood manipulation” such as through the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO).

The tribunal, made up of Tanja Haug (Chairman), Sentodji Roland Adjovi and Julien Berenger, ruled that Kipruto was involved in a deliberate and sophisticated doping regime over a long period of time in order to artificially enhance his performance through doping.

“Several abnormalities found in the Athlete’s ABP were linked to important competitions including the Valencia Half Marathon in 2020 and Kenyan Olympic trials in 2021,” the tribunal said.

The statement explained that blood doping outside of competitions can also be used to gain an advantage as it permits more intense training and this has an obvious effect on performance even after a significant period of time.

“This is corroborated by the fact that in recent years many athletes have been found positive for EPO far outside of competition,” said the tribunal.

Following the ban, Kipruto's 10km road-running world record in Valencia in 2020; 10,000m bronze medal in the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha and 10,000m victory in the 2019 Stockholm Diamond League, among many other honours, will now be annulled.

“The ABP is a critical tool in the quest to combat doping in elite athletes and this decision upholds important principles relating to ABP cases,” said AIU Head Brett Clothier.

Clothier said it can be difficult to directly detect the substances or methods used by sophisticated dopers, but the ABP gives them a chance to observe the telltale signs of blood doping over time.

For this reason, Clothier said AIU conducted more than 4,700 ABP tests in 2023 on elite athletes and that they will continue to invest heavily in our ABP programme going forward.

The ABP, introduced in 2009 to fight blood doping, is an electronic record that collects an athlete’s biological data over time to indirectly detect the effects of doping.

"Policeman storms forest station, kills two rangers and then ends his life","On Sunday night, Administration Police officer Evans Kimutai arrived at Cherangani Forest Station in Elgeyo Marakwet County where his girlfriend, a forest ranger, worked.

He had covered more than 300km from his work station at Todonyang Police Post in Turkana North sub-County in search of the said girlfriend.

It would later turn out that he was on a tragic mission.

Hours after his arrival, Cherangani Forest Station turned into a crime scene after the officer opened fire on Kenya Forest rangers, killing two and injuring one.

Then he turned the gun on himself to bring to an end his killing spree.

The young officer shot himself in the chin at the doorstep of the forest station manager.

When the gunshots finally went silent, three bullet-riddled bodies lay lifeless.

A third forest officer, Monica Kilonzi, sustained serious injuries on the upper right-side hand and right chest.

She was rushed to Kapcherop Health Centre before being transferred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret for medical attention. The three bodies were also taken to MTRH.

The assailant's girlfriend was not at the station at the time of the incident.

The forest officers who were killed have since been identified as Abdallah Dzabo Kitolle, 22, and Marion Jerono, 20.

Mr Kitolle, who was on duty as the night guard at the station, was killed as he attempted to alert three female officers.

He met his death at the doorstep where the two female officers were having dinner, after celebrating Madaraka Day at Kapsoar Sub County headquarters.

Mr Kitolle’s 21-year-old wife, Fatuma Omar, said her husband was barely worked for two years at the station.

“Abdalla was so caring and loving. He really loved me and our 10-month-old son,” said the young widow.

For the station manager, it was a lucky escape, as it appears the officer’s mission was to kill not just his girlfriend, but anyone in sight.

An AK-47 rifle was recovered at the scene of the crime. The assailant had three fully loaded magazines, of which he emptied one. Each magazine had 30 bullets.

The tragic Sunday night incident left Kapcherop Centre where the station is located in shock, as the forest officers and area residents struggled to come to terms with the tragic incident.

According to Elgeyo Marakwet County Police Commander Peter Mulinge, the heavily armed officer shot randomly, before killing the two KFS officers and injuring the third ranger.

Mr Mulinge said the assailant and his girlfriend had constantly differed. Their differences led the authorities to ban the assailant from the forest station.

According to the county police boss, the assailant's girlfriend was not at the forest station at the time of the incident.

According to officers at the station, the killer policeman claimed that some of his girlfriend's colleagues had been interfering in their relationship.

""We are still in shock following this incident. We call on young people to seek counseling from experts instead of taking matters into their own hands when facing relationship challenges,"" said area chief Andrew Chemaringo.

William Kimaiyo, an area resident, termed the incident as unfortunate, while calling on the government to ensure those recruited to join disciplined forces are young men and women of integrity.

""This incident has left us with a lot of pain as parents and residents, bearing in mind that the suspected killer was a well-known young man in this area. The government must be thorough in vetting youths joining disciplined forces to avoid such incidents,” said Mr Kimaiyo.

National Chief Conservator of Forests Alex Lemarkoko accompanied by senior KFS officers and a team of security officers from Kapsoar Sub County visited the station on Monday to assess the scene of crime and to condole with the families of the deceased officers.

“I had to fly from Nairobi to come and assess the situation upon learning that two of my officers had been killed by an assailant whom we have learned was a police officer from Turkana North. Unfortunately, we have lost two of our youngest officers,” said the KFS boss.

Mr Lemarkoko said police officers have embarked on investigations that will help KFS establish the root cause of the incident.

He, however, urged young people with relationship challenges to seek counselling instead of resorting to violence.

“As KFS we have a programme that we use to reach out to our officers. My advice to young people is that whenever they have relationship challenges they should always seek assistance from their seniors and other members of the society for guidance and counseling,” said Mr Lemarkoko.

US House passes Republican bill to sanction ICC over Israel,"The Republican-led US House of Representatives passed legislation that would impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court over its prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for Israeli officials related to the war in Gaza.

The vote was 247 to 155, with 42 Democrats joining Republicans in backing the measure.

There were no Republican ""nay"" votes, although two voted ""present.""

The measure is not expected to become law, but reflects continuing support for Israel in Congress amid international criticism over the Middle East country's campaign in the Gaza Strip.

The White House last month criticized the ICC's decision to seek the warrants.

The bill is not expected to be brought up for a vote in the Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats.

The legislation, opens new tab would impose sanctions on people involved in ICC prosecutions of Americans or citizens of US allies that are not ICC members, including Israel.

It also would block such ICC officials' entry to the United States, revoke any U.S. visas and restrict them from US property transactions.

ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said last month - after more than seven months of war in Gaza - that he had reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Netanyahu's defense chief and three Hamas leaders ""bear criminal responsibility"" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Netanyahu said the ICC prosecutor's decision was absurd and that the move was meant to target all of Israel.

Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October, vowing to destroy Hamas after militants attack southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

About 120 hostages remain in Gaza.

The Israeli military campaign has killed more than 36,000 people in densely populated Gaza, according to its health authorities, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.

Man who was electrocuted at work sues Kenya Power Company,"On January 18, Nelson Wamboka Mangala went to work as usual, unaware of the imminent danger that would later change his life forever, leaving him disabled.

Mr Mangala has informed the High Court in Nairobi that he worked as a security guard and general cleaner at an apartment building in Ruaka.

Upon arriving at work that morning, he said he began cleaning the apartment buildings as usual. While cleaning one of the apartment units on the balcony he accidentally came into contact with low-hanging electric wires and was electrocuted.

He was rushed to Rua Family Hospital for emergency treatment.

However, his injuries were so severe that the medical staff at the hospital recommended his immediate transfer to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).

Low hanging electric cables

According to the court documents, at KNH Mr Mangala was diagnosed with severe burns on his face, right hand, left arm, forearm, and severe extensor injuries.

Consequently, he underwent and continues to undergo treatment at the hospital.

His treatment included escharectomy, fasciotomy, debridement, daily dressing changes, and surgery to amputate his right mid-forearm.

After the incident, Mr Mangala moved to court and sued Kenya Power Company to seek compensation for the injuries he sustained.

""The electrocution by the electric cables and the injuries the plaintiff sustained are a direct result of Kenya Power Company's negligent, reckless and liable conduct,"" he said through Mogaka Elkana Advocates.

Mr Mangala said that on the balcony of one of the apartments, the electric cables and wires were hanging very low.

Caused grievous injuries

""I was electrocuted while cleaning. I felt a strong electric surge passing through my body and immediately lost consciousness. I regained consciousness at the hospital, surrounded by my brother and doctors who appeared very concerned,"" he said.

Mr Mangala said that it was at that moment he realised he was in significant pain and had limited mobility due to the bandages covering his body.

""The hospital had to amputate my arm and start the rehabilitation process to address my injuries. I have been receiving treatment ever since the incident,"" he said.

The plaintiff has also highlighted Kenya Power's negligence as poor cable management and faulty wiring, which endangers the lives of people with faulty electrical cables.

Mr Mangala has also accused Kenya Power Company of failing to warn users about dangerous equipment and live electrical cables lying nearby.

The company, which is yet to file a response to the lawsuit, has also been accused of failure to repair live faulty cables that caused grievous injuries to the plaintiff.

Medical expenses

“Consequent to these injuries, the plaintiff is suffering immensely and has already incurred huge medical bills for corrective surgery and general treatment,” Mr Mangala's lawyers said in court.

According to documents filed in court, Mr Mangala has incurred Sh348,991 in medical expenses at KNH.

He also incurred medical expenses in other medical facilities before he was admitted at KHN for a total of Sh355,872.

“Despite issuing demands to Kenya Power Company, it has failed to make good the claim,” Mr Mangala told the court.

The plaintiff is seeking to be paid special damages amounting to Sh355,872, general damages for pain and suffering, loss of future earnings and future medical expenses.

“I pray for any other relief that this court may deem fit and just in the circumstances,” he said in the court documents.

"Don't prosecute me, the law allows me to provide abortion services, medic argues in court","A clinical officer charged with the offence of providing abortion services has gone to court to challenge the legality of his arrest and prosecution.

Mr Gordon Akoyo is seeking a declaration that the arrest, detention and prosecution of him is illegal, arbitrary and in breach of the Constitution.

He also seeks a declaration that the arrest and prosecution of a trained health professional who provides abortion services is unlawful and in violation of the Constitution, the Health Act, the Sexual Offences Act and court precedents.

The petitioner stated that on September 5 last year, an unaccompanied minor, identified as ENM, arrived at a clinic with severe pain and heavy bleeding and asked for care, which he provided.

According to the petitioner, he received the minor at the age of 17 in his clinic, where she received emergency care, and upon examining her, came to the conclusion that the cause of the bleeding was severe menstrual bleeding and pain, or a miscarriage.

“While continuing to monitor ENM, electric power went out and the petitioner went to restore power. Upon the petitioner’s return to the examination room he found that she had left the facility without discharge,” the petition states.

Mr Akoyo says that on November 6 last year, he was summoned to Bamburi Police Station to record a statement regarding allegations of abortion.

The petitioner says that he was subsequently arrested and charged in Shanzu, where the court granted an application to detain him at Bamburi Police Station for five days for further investigation. Mr Akoyo says he was produced in court on November 15, charged and released on cash bail of Sh200,000.

He has challenged the charges against him, saying they are based on a mistaken belief by the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions that he provided abortion services and that abortion care is absolutely illegal in the country without regard to the Constitution.

In his petition to the High Court in Mombasa, Mr Akoyo has sued the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Inspector General of Police and the Senior Principal Magistrate of the Shanzu courts.

“The arrest and charge against the petitioner was made without any prior investigations into the alleged offence,” part of the petition states.

The petitioner claims that there was no inquiry on whether he was qualified and licensed to offer abortion care in line with the constitution, statutory and policy provisions and judicial precedents on abortion care in Kenya.

He adds that being arrested and detained for seven days on the alleged provision of abortion services, denied police cash bail and denying the opportunity to practice his trade and subsequent prosecution amounted to abuse and psychological torture.

“Arresting and charging the petitioner without regard to the constitution, statutes and prevailing judicial precedents on the law of abortion in the country creates a chilling effect not only for him but other reproductive healthcare providers across the country and limits their ability to fulfil their professional and constitutional obligations,” the petition states.

He argues that lack of clarity on the implementation of Article 26 (4) of the constitution has created fear and confusion among healthcare professionals, including himself, on the status of abortion in the country and violates the right to equality and freedom from discrimination.

The Article in question, under the Right to Life, states that ""Abortion is not permitted unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law.""

Mr Akoyo is also seeking an order quashing the charge sheet against him at the Shanzu Law Courts.

Furthermore, he wants a permanent injunction issued barring the DPP from prosecuting any health-trained professional providing abortion care as stipulated under Article 26 (4) of the constitution and the Health Act.

The High Court on Wednesday suspended the hearing of the case against Mr Akoyo at the Shanzu Law Courts pending the hearing and determination of his petition.

The case will be mentioned on July 29 for parties to highlight their submissions.

‘Summit all seven continents’ highest mountains’: Cheruiyot Kirui's ultimate ambition,"Late mountaineer Joshua Cheruiyot Kirui, who died two weeks ago while attempting to scale Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, had dreams of becoming the first Kenyan to achieve the so-called Explorers Grand Slam.

His teammates from the Ultra Runners Kenya Club made the revelation during the funeral service held at Chepterit Primary School Grounds in Chepterit, Nandi County.

To achieve the Explorers Grand Slam or the Adventurers Grand Slam as it is also known, one has to summit all the seven highest mountains on each continent.

Bringing the body down is a risky and costly affair, depending on a number of factors, according to one of the late Kirui's close hiking friends, Limo Kipkemoi.

At the funeral service attended by family, neighbours, friends and colleagues of the late Cheruiyot, framed photographs of the late mountaineer on the summits of various mountains were placed along the tents where the mourners sat.

It was a fitting reminder to the people of Chepterit, who turned out in large numbers for the memorial service, that Cheruiyot was not only their son but also a son of the mountains.

Some of the teachers who taught Cheruiyot at Chepterit Primary School, where his funeral service was held, eulogised the late mountaineer as a humble student.Although they noted that Cheruiyot was a shy student, they attributed his quest to conquer the mountains to his hardworking nature and desire to excel in whatever he did.

His friend Peter Muhia and a teammate at Ultra Runners Kenya, speaking on behalf of hikers, said that climbing Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, as difficult as it was, was not the banker's ultimate goal.

Becoming the first Kenyan and one of the few Africans to complete the Explorers GrandSlam was his dream, Mr Muhia revealed.

Having already climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, Cheruiyot would have had five more mountains to climb after Everest before embarking on a journey to the opposite ends of the Earth's surface - the North and South Poles.

The North Pole is defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface.

""One day when we were climbing Mount Kenya with Cheruiyot, I asked him what would happen after we climbed Everest. He told me that after conquering the highest mountain in Asia, in January next year (2025), we would climb Mount Aconcagua in Argentina (the highest in South America) before planning to climb the other peaks,"" said Muhia, who was supposed to climb Everest with Cheruiyot before changing his mind.

The summits conquered on the way to the Explorer's GrandSlam include: Mount Everest (Asia), Mount Kilimanjaro (Africa), Denali - also known as Mount McKinley (North America), Aconcagua (South America), Vinson Massif (Antarctica), Mount Elbrus (Europe), Mount Kosciuszko (Australia) and Carstensz Pyramid (Indonesia), considered the only technical rock climb of the expedition.

Mountaineers paid tribute to Cheruiyot as a brave and dedicated athlete whose passion served as an inspiration to those around him.

Explaining to the mourners on behalf of the family the decision to leave Cheruiyot's body on Everest's summit, Muhia said the process of retrieving the body was too dangerous and would probably have cost other lives.

He added that Cheruiyot was an experienced mountaineer and a lover of the mountains and his death was an accident.

""We climbed Mount Manaslu (Nepal) with Cheruiyot in September last year and we set a record by becoming the first Africans ever to reach the summit of this mountain, which is over 8,000m high, without supplemental oxygen and a guide. I will say that Cheruiyot was a very experienced mountaineer and his love for the mountains was unparalleled. I know that in time, some of us will make it to the summit of Mount Everest and we will see Joshua's body,"" said Muhia.

Born in 1984 in Kapsabet, Nandi, to Ruth and Wilson Kenduiywo, he was the second child in a family of five.

His mother confirmed in an earlier interview that Cheruiyot had shown an adventurous spirit at an early age when he could climb tall trees in their compound to the top.

Overwhelmed with emotion, the mother had little to say at the service, except to pay tribute to her son as a ""special child"".

""When God gave you to me, I gave you back to him for his care and provision. I know he has received you and you belong to him. Amen,"" her tribute read.

His father eulogised him as a confident and determined person whose passion for mountaineering had made him an icon.

The late Cheruiyot's colleagues at Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) remembered him as a hardworking team player who inspired others to give their best.

Caroline Wanjeri, the Director of the Mortgage Division at KCB, who read the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Russo's message of condolence, described Cheruiyot as a 'Star performer in the bank' whose immense contribution to the growth of the business saw him bank the company's Prestigious Simba award at some point.

Cheruiyot joined the bank in 2009 as a management trainee at the KCB Nandi Hills branch before rising to become senior relationship manager, corporate mortgages at the time of his death.His professionalism saw him carefully balance his work with his passion for social and outdoor activities, achieving immense success in both. Before he was reported missing and his body was finally found on 22 May just metres from the summit of Mount Everest, Cheruiyot had climbed several mountains, including Mount Manaslu (8,163m), Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Ruwenzori, Mount Longonot and Mount Kenya more than 20 times.

He has also completed over 50 marathons and several ultra-marathons (over 50km).

Debunking marriage myths,"Some years ago, when the fourth president of Kenya was sworn into office, I happened to be on an assignment with a government agency. For some reason, someone started a rumour that I was a niece to the then First Lady. The more I tried to debunk the story, the more it gained traction.

“Oh my, you look a lot like your aunt, short hair, and you speak alike!” What?

Read: Is marriage worth the cost for women?

“We are not even from the same community.” Some people wanted to know how to get government tenders. “Could you connect me to the Ministry? I know you can…” They thought I was trying to be humble when I said I was not related to the First Family. Of course, others thought I was just being stingy. One morning, as I drove in to hustle for a parking space like the rest of the Kenyans in the building, which had limited slots and was allocated on a first-come basis, a security guard ran up to my car, smiling. I could have sworn he was about to salute/ I smiled back.

“Madam, we have a parking slot for you.” That is probably the best greeting a Nairobian jostling for free parking would love to hear. I kid you not, but he ushered me into a VIP parking lot. It helped that I drove a big machine then, which perfectly fit amongst the rest. And that folk is how I enjoyed free VIP parking for months and the occasional salute. A lady cannot protest too much now, can she? That too is how fake news spreads, a phenomenon called the illusionary truth effect.

The illusion of truth describes how when we hear the same false information repeated time and again, we often come to believe it is true, in what is also referred to as the law of propaganda. ‘Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth.’ Repetition might make a statement seem truer, but it remains a lie or a myth.

We have loads of these in marriages. A repetition of statements, passed down from one generation to the next encultures us to believe them to be true. Let us debunk some of the lies about marriage.

Marriage is a life sentence.

No, it is a voluntary commitment, intended for a lifetime of love, friendship, and companionship. But these do not always happen, and therefore, one can exit an abusive marriage, where love, friendship, and respect are no longer served.

The husband is the provider.

A husband’s most critical role is to protect his wife and children, not from wild animals but from the vagaries of life, with his arms and words. It does not matter how much he provides if he does not accompany that with the protection of his family. Unfortunately, some ill-informed husbands are the perpetrators of hurt against the very people they should protect.

Fighting for a marriage makes it work

If a marriage is already in ICU, even the juju man will not help you turn it around. Remember, marriage is a voluntary relationship between two adults. It will take the two of you to work together for a healthy thriving relationship.

Marriage is 50/50

It is 100% or it is not a marriage. You give your all, and they do the same. If anyone puts in less than one hundred percent, then that is an exploitative relationship, serving only one of you, the one putting in less than one hundred percent.

Read: Loving your spouse as you age together

Happy marriages have no fights

All human relationships experience conflict. Marriage is no exception. The only difference is how the conflict is handled. You will occasionally differ, but healthy couples agree to disagree, and most importantly, when both feel safe to table any issue, that is a happy and healthy union. Research in fact demonstrates that conflict is healthy, as it allows everyone to express themselves, to feel heard and seen in the relationship.

Marriage sex is boring

That is a big lie. The most intense and intimate sexual experiences are within a committed relationship. People express themselves best when there are no inhibitions when they fully trust the person they are with, and when they aim to please each other. Things get better and deeper with time when dealing with a long term partner than with a stranger.

His people become your people

You two are to form your own boma and create your family culture, otherwise, some in-laws will as soon part you than unite you.

What else have you heard about marriage that with time you have realized was untrue?

"30 years of climate talks: Minimal progress, crucial stakes for Africa","In Bonn, Germany

As experts gather in Bonn for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a palpable sense of urgency and frustration.

Over the past thirty years, these international climate talks have aimed to tackle the worsening environmental crisis. However, many maintain that there has been little progress, prompting crucial questions about the importance and impact of these talks, particularly for Africa.

""Adaptation is a critical issue for Africa. That is why it is always on the agenda. But there is yet to be progress on National Adaptation Plans,"" Obed Koringo, a climate policy expert from Care International, says.

""I have been a climate negotiator for five years,"" Marlene Achoki from the Kenya delegation says. The progress has not been as fast as we expected, and that can get frustrating. But we have to keep going because we have been seeing some progress, especially on issues around adaptation.""

The Stakes for Africa

Despite being the lowest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, the African continent experiences the greatest impact of climate change. It faces rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall patterns, devastating droughts, and an increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events. These changes pose significant threats to food security, access to water, and the well-being of millions of people. The African Group has consistently emphasised Africa's vulnerability to these climate challenges, underscoring the critical importance of the outcomes of climate talks for African nations.

""Look at the flooding that happened recently in Kenya. More than 200 people died. That is the kind of climate disaster we are experiencing on the continent. Who is going to compensate us for that? That is why we must be here,"" says Anne Tek, a climate justice expert with FEMNET.

""As a continent, it is important that we participate in these talks. This is the only way we get our voices heard, and by being here, we speak on behalf of our people. They have given us the mandate to tell the world what is happening back home and find solutions,"" Marlene says.

""If we don't participate in climate talks, then we would have failed the continent. The progress is slow, but it doesn't mean we give up,"" Obed says.



Why the Talks Matter

Platform for Advocacy:For African countries, climate negotiations are a vital platform to advocate for their distinct needs and perspectives. These discussions ensure that the voices of those most affected yet least responsible are heard on the global stage. This advocacy is crucial for pushing for policies and funding addressing the specific climate challenges African communities face.

Funding and Support:One critical aspect of the climate talks is the discussion of financial aid from developed countries to developing ones. This support is vital for Africa to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies. Although the promised $100 billion per year in climate finance from developed nations has fallen short, continued negotiations aim to hold these countries accountable and ensure that Africa receives the necessary funds.

Technology Transfer: Climate talks also facilitate discussions on technology transfer from developed to developing countries. Access to advanced technology can help African nations leapfrog to cleaner and more efficient energy systems, build climate-resilient infrastructure, and create sustainable agricultural practices.

Global Solidarity: These talks underscore the principle of worldwide solidarity and shared responsibility. They emphasise that the climate crisis is a collective problem requiring collective action. Africa's participation in these negotiations underscores its commitment to being part of the global solution despite its limited resources and contributions to the problem.

The road ahead

While the progress over the past 30 years may seem slow and insufficient, abandoning the climate talks is not an option for Africa. The stakes are too high, particularly for Africa.

""The United Nations Climate Change framework provides guidelines and rules under which all countries engage on climate change, in what is known as a multilateral process. These rules of engagement provide an equal playing field for everyone to come to the table and talk. This is the only place where people will listen,"" Julius Mbatia, a climate policy expert,

The Bonn talks are intended to prepare for the annual mega-conference on climate change, known as the Conference of Parties (COP), and typically involve highly technical discussions. In Bonn, the agenda for the COP is developed. As the newly elected chair of the African Group of Negotiators, Kenya is leading these talks and will also champion the continent's climate agenda at COP 29 later this year.

"Reject new tax proposals, manufacturers urge MPs","More than 500 organisations that have submitted views on the Finance Bill, 2024 are opposed to the introduction of taxes on bread, cooking oil, vehicles, excise duty and VAT on financial services, the eco levy and levies on electric cars.

The stakeholders who appeared before the National Assembly Finance and Planning Committee, asked lawmakers to zero-rate the products and cushion Kenyans from the high cost of living.

The organisations took issue with the 16 per cent VAT on bread and 25 per cent on crude and refined vegetable oils, saying it would push the cost of these essential commodities out of reach of ordinary families.

Appearing before the team chaired by Molo MP Kuria Kimani, the organisations demanded the rejection of the proposal to impose VAT on financial services and an increase of excise duty on the services from the current 15 to 20 per cent.

Read: Financial experts warn MPs against passing Finance Bill as proposed

They also opposed the imposition of VAT on forex transactions, processing of cheques as well as the 10 to 20 per cent rise in the cost of M-Pesa and money transfer charges.

The industry players want the deletion of the proposal to impose an annual 2.5 per cent motor vehicle tax based on the value of the vehicle and the eco levy of Sh150 per kilogramme on articles of plastic packaging materials.

The National Treasury expects to make least Sh58 billion from the motor vehicle tax. The Finance Bill, 2024 seeks to raise Sh302 billion to finance the Sh3.9 trillion budget for 2024/25 financial year.

According to the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), the eco levy – some Sh150 per kilo of plastic packaging – would increase the prices of plastic packaging materials, batteries and hygiene products.

If the levy is passed, KAM argues, the cost of a loaf of bread will increase by Sh9 to Sh74; a litre of cooking oil by Sh16.81 to Sh316.81 while the price of a kilogramme of power detergent will go up by Sh30 to Sh230.

“If implemented as is, the bill will increase the cost of production, thereby destroying industry competitiveness, and subsequently, dent our local and export markets. It will lead to an increase in retail prices...and cash flow requirement when the environment is characterised by rising interest rates,” KAM Chief Executive Anthony Mwangi said.

Read: New vehicle sales drop 17pc on high taxes, interest rates

“This will render local industries uncompetitive, which will push them to either downsize, move to more competitive countries or close down.”

Edible oil manufacturers said the implication of the excise duty adjustments on raw and refined vegetable oils would see the price of a 400g loaf of bread increase by Sh10.

The effects would extend to other products derived from the oils, with the price of long bar soap likely to shoot from Sh200 to ShSh350 and 250g margarine to be sold for Sh300 from Sh160.

The Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI) asked MPs to reject the car tax and the introduction of VAT on insurance services.

AKI said the 16 per cent VAT would be passed to consumers and increase premiums.

The organisations also opposed new taxes on electric vehicles, arguing it would kill the industry.

The zero rating of the supply of electric bicycles, motorcycles, cars and buses was introduced by the Finance Act, 2023 as an incentive to the growth of e-mobility and encourage the adoption of the vehicles.

Mr Hezbon Mose, the President of the Electric Mobility Association of Kenya, said withdrawing the incentive only a year after it was introduced may be premature, considering that there was a 500 per cent acceleration of the uptake the vehicles in the period of the incentive, and that investments grew significantly.

A consortium of mobile devices assemblers, including Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom, said President William Ruto’s pledge that Kenya would make handsets valued at less than $50 phone would not be realised with the imposition of VAT.

The bill proposes 16 per cent VAT on locally assembled mobile phones, currently zero-rated.

“The impact of VAT on East Africa Device Assembly Kenya Ltd (EADAK) is that it will increase the retail price of Neon Smarta to Sh8,699 from Sh7,499,” said Johnstone Kamunde, the EADAK Chief Finance Officer.

“The cost of Neon Ultra phone will rise to Sh10,439 from Sh8,999. This is a Sh1,440 rise. The 16 per cent VAT will be borne by the customer.”

Hustle in the ‘hood: Beware of dream-jackers,"My definition of a dream-jacker is someone or something that seizes a person or people's hopes, dreams and aspirations by force or through false pretenses. The items seized can be concepts, ideas, creations, intellectual property, innovations or inventions.

Dream-jackers pilfer gems and generational wealth. Some dream-jackers use witchcraft to kill, steal and destroy destinies. Others use more subtle and sophisticated means to hijack dreams. And it's these subtle types I want to talk about.

Crime and social vices are dream-jackers. A young cat can be caught up in a (lifestyle) trap; which may lead him to an early grave, jail or spending the rest of his life on Regretters Road. I’ve witnessed dream-jackers - such as addictions and criminality - casting lengthy (and sometimes permanent) eclipses on brilliant brothers smack in the noontide of their lives.

Experience

Disclaimer: Sometimes subtle dream-jackers are not even aware of what they are doing. They may have the best intentions. But, as the saying goes; the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

In August 1998, Gilbert and I had the idea of doing a flower hawking business. Gilbert and I lived in the same ‘hood - Jericho Estate - and we just wanted to make our money the legit way.

We had a neighbour who used to work at a flower-exporting firm. We went to ask for her advice. Before Gilbert and I knew it, we were reporting to this boss lady.

Read: How to turn rejection into a blessing

Boss Lady bought the flowers and said she would be our supplier. But we were ‘hood hustlers. We knew she'd done a switcheroo. We were now employees.

Well? That hustle dried up faster than fresh roses.

The same script replayed itself several years later. Another hommie and I wanted to start up a mitumba shoes business. We shared the idea with a moneyed neighbour.

Long story short? Mr. Moneybags bought several bales of mitumba shoes and asked us to sell them for a commission. There's a difference between starting somewhere and starting from an idea that's been stolen from you. We weren't as enthusiastic about the biz as we would've been had it been ours. Which is why it died a quick death.

Gifted, grifters and gatekeepers

I get it. Every rat wants to get ahead in the race. And sometimes - (but this I don’t get, though) - this entails stealing other dogs’ bones so you can be the Top Dawg.

The creative industry is full of dream-jackers. In this space, there are three types of players; gifted, grifters and gatekeepers. Oftentimes, the gifted - those who have “it” - don't have the wherewithal to actualise their dreams. Grifters - who usually masquerade as gifted - are often loaded with dough, followers and connections, and want a pound of the gifted's flesh. On the other hand, gatekeepers are persons or systems that control access to influence and finances.

Clarification: The gifted can also be grifters and/or gatekeepers.

Dreamer beware

Listen, baby. Protect your baby at all costs. Dreams aren't meant to be shared with just any Tom, Dick or Harriet. Don't be too quick to do reveals for your babies.

Read: Every man needs a good bad friend

This town is full of shysters who want to eat other people's sweat, then feed your carcass to the hounds. Which is why you should always be on your toes.

When pitching a concept, have a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). If the person or parties are averse to signing an NDA, it will tell you they are potential dream-jackers. And if you must reveal the concept sans NDA, drop them just a morsel.

Here's the whole truth and nothing but. Only the dream-carrier can actualise an idea the way it was destined. If, say, grifters and gatekeepers jack a morsel of your dream, you still have a mound at your disposal.

Peace.

Dramatic photo finish at Sardinia Rally just what WRC ordered,"Ott Tanak, the Estonian 2019 world rally champion is a very lucky man.

He is also and a good example of how fickle and unpredictable rallying is.

Tanak was destined to a second place finish in last weekend's WRC Sardinia Italy behind Frenchman eight times world champion Sebastien Ogier until 3km from the finish in the very last section when he took the lead with the smallest margins possible, almost a dead heat finish.

Tanak was only concerned about scoring construction championships points for Hyundai Motorsports while safeguarding his second overall position.

His team had earlier intervened and urged him to gun for the constructors points for Hyundai instead of taking unnecessary risks trying to challenge Ogier for the lead after Saturday's action.

Tanak was the quickest driver in the morning loop on Saturday. But Ogier turned on the pressure to win the afternoon loop and end the day with maximum 18 points, three better than the Estonian and with a 17.1 seconds lead.

But Tanak did not relent and whittled this lead to 6.02seconds as the drivers entered the Sassari Power Stage before drama unfolded.

Ogier suffered a puncture 3km from the finish of the stage, and lost by two tenths of a second (0.2), or simply put being edged out in an Olympics 100 metres photo finish dash.

Winning time

Tanak’s 0.2 seconds winning time equalled a similar margin between Ogier and Toyota Gazoo racing team principal Jari-Matti Latvala in 2011 WRC Jordan. The Frenchman was the victor.

This is the second time Ogier has lost Sardinia at the same stage after the 2019 misfortune when he suffered steering problems.

These results also confirm how evenly matched the current generation of WRC drivers have become and also the surge and form of the Hyundai car and team this season.

However, the highlight of Sardinia was the successful implementation of recommendations done by a work group appointed by the FIA last December to make the WRC more attractive and competitive.

The group proposed varied changes which will make each round of the WRC distinctive and divided into sprints and endurance on one side; and also characterised by the prevailing geographical and climatic conditions of each leg.

This has divided the WRC into asphalt, tarmac and ice.

This year’s Sardinia was the third round of the asphalt rallies after WRC Safari Rally and WRC Portugal.

Conditions were dry but some sections really rough like the stage which knocked off current championship leader Belgian Thierry Neuville on Saturday.

New sprint format

He was forced to retire but rejoined the rally on Sunday to safeguard his points lead which was reduced by six by Elfyn Evans.

Neuville has 122 points and Evans 104, same as Tanak. Ogier has 92 and Adrien Fourmaux of France 74.

The rally, though tough, was also reduced to a 48 hours sprint in a new format, which, if it proves popular will turn the WRC into a two and a half days affair instead of three to four days as has been the tradition with all WRC rounds.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia joined the WRC circuit from 2026, and for the next 10 years.

Rally Saudi Arabia promises to showcase the country’s diverse and challenging landscapes on surfaces ranging from volcanic rock to sandy desert terrain, providing a novel test for crews with conditions never previously encountered in WRC history.

While Saudi Arabia is a newcomer to the WRC, it boasts a proven track record with a multitude of international sporting events hosted there including the Dakar Rally, Formula 1, football, and golf.

HRH Prince Khalid Bin Sultan Al Abdullah Al-Faisal, Chairman of the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation and the Saudi Motorsport Company, was delighted to welcome WRC to Saudi Arabia.

The costly price of period poverty: Turkana schoolgirls skip classes,"Most girls in public schools in Turkana County who have attained puberty are missing classes because of unreliable and uncoordinated supply of sanitary towels.

The situation is worse for girls from poor backgrounds and in remote areas where they can't afford the pads when on their menses. Such girls opt to stay at home than feel ashamed.

In a spot check at public institutions, teachers confirmed that the national government has yet to provide free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels to every girl who should at least get nine packs of pads per academic year.

Read: Where are the free pads for schoolgirls?

The situation is forcing development partners of specific schools for donations with varied interests, with getting those committed to sustainably take up the task for many years being difficult.

In Kataboi Girls Secondary School and adjacent Kataboi Junior Secondary School in Turkana North with a total population of 700 students, for instance, school principal Omaido Robella always reach out to partners and well-wishers to support the girls every term.

Ms Robella says she understands family background of her girls and leaving them on their own to tackle menstrual hygiene is an uphill task that will not only expose them to sex predators and have a negative impact on their future if some of them decide to drop out of school.

“Not all students in the school can afford the sanitary kits because of poor background. Others don't even carry soaps to wash their panties. This is why I am always engaging partners to help.”

She recalled the most successful activity is when the school hosted well-wishers under Arsenal Turkana Chapter and more than six partners through a day’s event dubbed 'Pads for Love'.

On the outskirts of Lodwar town, the Church Mission Network targeted poor families in Natapar Kakono, Nakwamekwi and Kanam Kemer with relief food and free washable sanitary towels that can last for five years when well taken care of.

Read: Call for special sanitary pads budget for schools

A parent, Jane Esinyen, said washable sanitary towels was a relief for her as despite being near Lodwar town, she can't afford pads for her two girls when the government delay to supply them as it is in the current situation.

“Without help, my girls have been missing classes for fear of staining their school uniform and being ridiculed. They see themselves as being dirty, unhygienic and impure,"" Ms Esinyen said.

Turkana Governor Jeremiah Lomorukai's wife Lillian Ekamais stressed the need for coordinated distribution of sanitary towels so that no girl is disadvantaged.

At Lodwar Mixed Primary school, with support from partners, she distributed 2,300 dignity kits, 2,600 packets of disposal pads and 550 reusable pads, and other items to support schoolgirls.

Ms Ekamais challenged partners to not only target schools within major towns but also reach out to border schools on Kibish and Turkana East as well as prioritise menstruation education as its negligence has led to infections among girls.

County Chief Officer for Preventive and Promotive Health Cathra Abdi regretted that stigma surrounding menstruation and a lack of sanitary pads had affected and forced girls to leave school.

She announced that her department would map out committed partners for strategic provision of sanitary towels across the county and raise awareness of menstrual health hygiene among adolescent girls.

Teachers, especially in secondary schools with high enrolment of girls, called on the government and development partners to install incinerators for hygienic disposal of used menstrual clothes and sanitary towels.

KQ extends freeze on staff complimentary tickets,"Kenya Airways (KQ) has extended a freeze on a complimentary scheme that allows its staff to travel for free amid an investigation into abuse of the initiative.

The scheme called buddy pass entitles the airline’s employees to two free flights a year, each accompanied by up to four other passengers. It allows staff to nominate family and friends within specified limits and clear accompanying rules.

The scheme has, however, been abused by some KQ employees prompting the airline to suspend it in April, pending investigations that were initially scheduled to end on May 17.

KQ has since extended the suspension of the scheme beyond a revised May 31 date it had earlier indicated.

“The suspension of the buddy pass programme at Kenya Airway is still on. We have suspended it by a few more days as per the last memo I issued to staff,” said KQ chief people officer Tom Shivo.

The national carrier has begun dismissing staff members found guilty of abusing the buddy pass privilege.

Although buddy passes are normal in the airline industry, the best practice requires that staff do not benefit commercially from the scheme, the same way work-related benefits should not be passed on to third parties.

Other airlines offer an employee one free ticket a year and unlimited tickets for family members and friends at a set percentage of the full fare with close monitoring to discourage commercialisation.

Some international airlines require staff to submit a list of immediate family members and dependents at the beginning of the year, subject to review after six months, and with no option of selling to third parties.

Under Resolution 788 of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which provides for free or reduced fare transportation to an employee for an air carrier, the immediate family — spouse, children, parents, brothers, sisters, and dependants — are listed as the beneficiaries of a buddy scheme.

“It’s a privilege offered to staff, so when it's abused we can withdraw it. These are internal matters,” said a top source at the airline’s communication office on Tuesday, June 4.

From criminals to IT experts: Inside plan to reinvent Mulot,"The government has announced plans to establish an information and communication technology (ICT) hub in Mulot as part of efforts to shed the region’s reputation as East Africa’s cybercrime headquarters.

The devolved administration has secured land for the project to build Kenya’s first rural-based hub of its kind. The multibillion-shilling initiative will be implemented by the Kenyan government in collaboration with global ICT companies. This follows President William Ruto’s directive to the county government to secure land for the ICT hub.

“We want to ensure that the youths in Mulot put their talents to good use instead of engaging in cybercrime,” Dr Ruto said in Bomet town recently.

Illegal activities

For years, Mulot has been notorious for mobile money fraud, with trading centres such as Mulot Central, Mulot Olomirani, and Mulot Sunset becoming hotspots for illegal activities.

The Bomet County Government has secured 52 acres in Mulot Sunset for the ICT hub, said Stella Rotich, the chief officer in charge of ICT in the county.

“Setting up a software development factory will transform Mulot from a cybercrime hub to a centre of innovation and coding training for the youth. It will be a game-changer in the country,” Ms Rotich told the Nation.

She added that, in the interim, an ICT hub will be established on a 4.5-acre plot initially identified for the project, with tendering for the project expected to start in the 2024/2025 financial year.

Governor Hillary Barchok said his administration was working with the State to turn the region’s fortunes around.

“We have succeeded in securing the land and are looking forward to the allocation of funds for construction of the software factory,” Professor Barchok said.

The centre will also train the youth on e-commerce, said Bomet East MP Richard Yegon, adding:“It is important that we rid the area of crime. The software factory will expand Mulot into a major trading centre and create employment for locals.”

SIM swap criminals

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been tracking down SIM swap criminals.

County police boss Robinson Ndiwa told the Nation that the crackdown was starting to bear fruits following the arrest of several suspects.

“The problem we are faced with is the failure by the victims to come forward and prosecute the cases, forcing the courts to release them,” Mr Ndiwa said. In the past six months, more than 25 suspects have been arrested.

A Bomet court recently released five mobile money fraudsters who were arrested with exercise books filled with names of the targeted victims alongside their mobile phone numbers, SIM card pins, M-Pesa balances, Fuliza limits, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) account details and KCB M-Pesa loan limits.

The books had records of names and dates of births of the SIM card holders, their home origins among other crucial details.

Police had also recovered 14 unused SIM cards, nine Safaricom used SIM cards and 11 national identity cards suspected to have been stolen.

The case collapsed after Safaricom and Airtel refused to cooperate with the investigators, according to State prosecutor Clara Boyon, with the Resident Magistrate Mbethi Michuki allowing the prosecution to close the file.

Following the police operation, a majority of the fraudsters have now relocated to Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu, Kajiado, Baringo and Nairobi counties.

Impending raids

The police have in the past been accused of colluding with the criminals by tipping them off about impending raids, thereby facilitating their escape.

On May 17, 2024, a police officer was arrested in Kericho in a case where a doctor was conned of Sh1.5 million. Constable Richard Kipkoech Kirinyet who was based at Cheptalal Police Station in Konoin Sub-county in Bomet County was accused of receiving Sh489,788 through his mobile phone with the SIM card registered in his name, being part of the Sh1,521,633 fraudulently transferred to from the KCB account of a Nairobi-based doctor.

Interestingly, most Mulot cybercrime suspects are primary and secondary school dropouts.

They are suspected to work in cahoots with employees from mobile phone companies and banking institutions, some of whom have been sacked over integrity issues.

Cheers to the women who are ‘difficult to love’,"Warsan Shire's poignant poem ""For Women Who Are Difficult to Love"" lyrically celebrates feminine individuality and authenticity.

It’s an ode to that ""terrifying, strange, and beautiful woman who's a horse running alone, and he tries to tame you."" It honours the woman who's ""something not everyone knows how to love.""

If you are a woman who's ever tried to shrink yourself to fit into a man’s (or the world’s) idea of who you should be, then this poem is for you.

If, like the late Prof Wangari Maathai, you have ever been told you are too much of anything, then this poem is for you.

For those unfamiliar with Prof Maathai’s brand of “unlovability,” during her divorce, the Nobel laureate’s ex-husband claimed she was “too educated, too strong, too successful, too stubborn, and too hard to control”.

Read: It’s raining single women

Ms Shire’s poem symbolises women's unshackling from the demands and expectations of a deeply patriarchal society.

There's nothing more intimidating to patriarchy than a woman who is free, confident, outspoken, and self-assured.

A male acquaintance once told me that outspoken women needed to be domesticated — relegated to traditional roles of wife, mother, and homemaker.

I retorted that these women were not wild animals.

In retrospect, there's nothing wrong with being a wild animal in response to patriarchy.

Stella Nyanzi's brand of feminism is particularly wild and free. Ms Nyanzi is a Ugandan human rights advocate, poet, medical anthropologist, feminist, and queer rights advocate who has stripped to get her points across.

Defying patriarchy

Women staying in their stereotypical roles benefit the power structures of a patriarchal society. I celebrate all the women who defy this.

In an episode of the Women Lift Health Global Conference Podcast Series titled Confronting Fears That Silence Women, Speaking Up & Standing Out, two of the boldest media personalities I’ve ever encountered, Lizz Ntonjira and Rachel Ombaka, speak about the fear that holds women back.

It's a fear that, like the one described by Toni Morrison in Jazz about the character Alice, is “Seeded in childhood, watered every day since fear had sprouted through her veins all her life”.

Ms Ombaka and Ms Ntonjira discussed how girls are conditioned to seek approval, conform, and avoid criticism from childhood.

This fear of criticism follows them into boardrooms and sabotages them. They encouraged women to speak up, be bold, and unapologetic about who they are and their achievements.

As for me, I don't want to be a “good African woman”. I'm happy with being “something not everyone knows how to love.” I celebrate women from this tribe. Cheers to every woman who’s “difficult to love.”

Mexico's election of a female president

This article would be incomplete without celebrating Mexico's first female president Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Having read about her background and litany of achievements, I daresay that this woman of many firsts was also “difficult to love”.

"Dear CS Namwamba, as you celebrate the wins, truly fix Kenyan sports","If you read through the X handle of Cabinet Secretary for Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports, Ababu Namwamba, you would be forgiven for thinking Kenyan sports is flourishing.

The able, “Super CS"" who delivers, paints a picture of a utopian Kenyan sports world where glorious success is the order of the day, and all historical problems are astutely being handled.

Read him this year:

On an inspection visit of Talanta Sports City that is under construction:

“Talanta Sports City. Today, Saturday 25.05.2024. 86 days from ground-breaking. Coming along nicely, on track, on schedule. Deliberately, steadily, assuredly, we are fixing decades of neglect that has compromised status of Kenya's sports and creatives infrastructure. Confident.”

Another one on the renovation of our stadiums:

“Perfectly on course with the most significant and consequential stadium upgrade in Kenya's history. Temporary inconvenience, Permanent solution to decades of neglect. #TalantaHela”.

On Kenya’s Fifa World Cup quest:

“Harambee Stars coach Firat praises Sports CS Namwamba’s transformative zeal.”

On the government’s pet sports project, Talanta Hela:

“Every blade of grass, every grain of sand. Wherever a special talent is in Whatever corner of our Republic, we shall identify, nurture and monetise it. #TalantaHela.”

Then his cathartic, fawning congratulatory messages to Kenyan national teams that have registered victory on the international arena.

In athletics: “Congratulations #TeamKenya for this thrilling triumph at the 2024 World Cross Country Championship in Belgrade, Serbia. You have conquered the whole world, once again, bringing pride to our nation. HONGERA!”

In women’s football: “Hongera #JuniorStarlets for beating Ethiopia 3-0 today to qualify for the 4th and final round in the qualifiers for the FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup 2024 that is scheduled for the Dominican Republic in October. You, our superb girls, have made Kenya proud. Now we knuckle up for Burundi. Two more games to history.”

In rugby: “Hongera lads. You are our Madaraka Day #Shujaa for returning Kenya to the World Rugby 7s High Table!”

Inspirational leadership

But are things really this good to make our CS go gaga on X not unlike the Kenya Corner at a world SVNS arena?

Scratch the surface, and you find, while there may be some good stories, Kenyan sports is generally hurting and struggling, bereft of sponsorship, short on inspirational leadership, and lacking sound management.

For starters, how can a country of over 50 million that prides itself in being a sports powerhouse close down all its ""international-class"" stadiums amidst a heavy international calendar?

Athletes are crying. Footballers have fled to Malawi to host Kenya’s international matches.

I almost shed a tear for our boxing. For the first time since 1964 Kenya will not have a single fighter at the Olympic Games after all members of the once famous and feared “Hit Squad” failed to secure a Paris ticket.

Cricket is seemingly forgotten. Imagine, a record 20 teams are in the United States and West Indies for the Twenty20 World Cup, including Uganda.

Kenya, once a giant of the game and one-time World Cup ODI semi-finalists, did not even threaten to qualify.

As a former rugby player, it is disheartening to write that Kenya Under-20 rugby side Chipu, are struggling with preparations to represent the country in July’s World Rugby Under-20 Trophy in Scotland.

Perpetual crisis

The less spoken about football the better.

I just wonder what the CS’s end game was in reversing a decision by the same, same government to disband the FKF following recommendations of a ministry-constituted probe committee that found serious legal and managerial problems within the federation.

The upshot is that there are numerous court cases concerning football with the administration of the game at the precipice of a legal quagmire.

Did returning to the international football community solve Kenya’s underlying football problems? No.

The federation has lost almost all goodwill and no sponsor wants to touch them, even with a 10-foot pole.

Clubs are literally on their deathbeds, barely surviving. Small wonder struggling players and officials are being implicated in match-fixing

These same clubs are poorly managed and in perpetual crisis.

What happened to the CAF Club Licensing regulations that were meant to prevent our clubs from being run like roadside kiosks?

Good governance

Why has the sports ministry not been active in helping clubs across all sports disciplines to become more professional in their operations?

Why has the government balked at strictly enforcing the Sports Act? Is the Sports Fund being used optimally?

What a contrast with government actions in the West that we, ironically, aspire to emulate.

Just to pick a couple. The Spanish government on April 25 formed a special committee to oversee the country's football federation pending fresh elections

Spain’s National Sports Council explained the action was ""in response to the crisis in the organisation and in defence of the general interest of Spain.""

Last week the Italian government appointed a cabinet-approved committee of experts to oversee the finances of professional sports clubs.

The committee will supervise ""the legality and regularity of the economic and financial management of professional sports clubs"" in sports such as football and basketball, to ensure they are properly managed and sustainable.

The British government is planning via an Act of Parliament to establish an independent football regulator to oversee the sport and encourage financial stability.

What is the Kenyan government doing to encourage good governance and financial viability of sports entities in Kenya? What say you, Super CS?

"Anatomy of a sick nation: Patients suffer amid drug, vaccine shortage in hospitals","The country’s public hospitals are facing a severe shortage of essential drugs and vaccines, leaving critically ill patients without access to life-saving treatment.

Some of the most affected are HIV prophylaxis for children, painkillers, antibiotics, antidepressants, anticancers as well as antidiabetic drugs.

Also lacking are medicines needed in the performance of life-saving surgical procedures, such as anaesthesia.

The Nation has also learnt that the country has no syringes to administer vaccines.

The shortage exposes a deeper problem within the country’s healthcare system — inadequate financing, irregular and delayed release of funds for drug procurement and significant debts owed to international health organisations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).

This has led to empty shelves in hospital pharmacies and rising despair among patients who rely on these drugs for survival.

Read: Alarm as public hospitals run short of common drugs

It is not known when supply will be revamped, but Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha told the Nation that the shortage had been resolved, with some of the drugs already in the country and others expected next week.

Ms Nakhumicha explained that the challenges facing Kenya’s healthcare system are a reflection of the country’s health supply chain being broken and vendor-driven.

“A responsive supply chain is based on needs and once the needs are established, then data-driven quantification and forecasting is done to determine quantities for procurement. This is why I am focused on reforms. It’s not going to be easy to change, but I am determined,” she said.

Out of stock

Ms Nakhumicha also denied that nevirapine and zidovudine drugs were out of reach for many HIV-positive mothers with newborns.

“Those saying we are out of stock should check with the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (Nascop) on service and commodity security for HIV,” she stated.

“The country’s stocks of nevirapine cover 15 months while those of zidovudine cover 14 months,” the Health CS told the Nation, adding that global best practice expects them to have a minimum stock cover of at least nine months.

A spot check in hospitals and interviews with patients, however, indicated that there are no drugs in many public hospitals.

The Nation met 26-year-old *Joy Njeri, a newborn mum, outside Thika District Hospital in Gatundu South, Kiambu County, where she had camped from morning in search of paediatric HIV drugs.

It was her third day at the hospital.

Read: Mothers we lost inside maternity wards

Ms Njeri, who disclosed to the Nation that she was born with HIV, was at the hospital for drugs for her two-week-old baby.

“I am here because the doctors told me that they had run out of nevirapine and zidovudine, which are usually given as prophylaxis to a baby exposed to the deadly virus at birth so that they do not contract the disease through breast milk,” she said.

“I don’t want my baby to get HIV. I have been coming to the hospital with the hope that the vital medication will be made available. I was told to keep checking and that the hospital was inquiring from other hospitals if they had supplies.”

The same drug is missing in Kibra. Ms Zipporah Achieng’, a community health promoter and HIV warrior born with the virus, said she has been approached by parents who have run out of the drug.

HIV-positive

“They come to me because I am open about my HIV-positive status and have a three-year-old child who is HIV-negative. They want the same for their babies but unfortunately, the drugs that my baby was put on are out of reach for them.”

She disclosed that the situation is dire in Kibra with mothers who were lucky to get the sought-after drugs a few months ago sharing their doses with recent newborn mothers and putting their own babies in danger.

Ms Achieng’ is concerned that the country could be ‘silently breeding’ a new generation of HIV-positive children because the government has not made the drugs available.

As the hospitals report a shortage of critical drugs that are on the country’s essential list, a number are also recording shortages of children’s vaccines.

Many children being born now are going without the vaccines hence putting their lives at risk of contracting deadly diseases in future.

“There are also no doses of childhood vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). My baby has not received any jab. I am concerned about where I can get the vaccine. I have been to many health facilities in Kibra and Mathare,” Ms Lucy Atieno from Dagoretti revealed.

The shortage will see at least 1.6 million infants, a similar number of pregnant women as well as 750,000 girls under the age of 10 who need the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, fail to get them.

About 15,000 fewer children were vaccinated in April when the country started recording the shortages, but the number could be higher since the issue has not been resolved.

The HPV vaccine is given to girls under 10, who number about 750,000 every year. The remaining stock in some hospitals may not last a month.

A Ministry of Health insider told the Nation that the government has up to July 1 to clear a Sh1.5 billion debt for the last financial year to Unicef and Gavi so that Gavi can release their co-financing portion of Sh8 billion for this financial year.

Kenya, too, has to put Sh3.6 billion of its own into the scheme. This is because Kenya must submit its 20 per cent contribution to Gavi before the organisation releases its 80 per cent funding.

This is to put the country on a trajectory of self-sustainability and prepare it for the phasing out of Gavi backing.

Read: How mothers are left to die at night, weekends and holidays in referral hospitals

“Last week, the government paid Sh1.25 billion to the international organisation and this opened the door for emergency procurement. The government has since requested Unicef to expedite delivery. We are expecting the first batch next week. But should the government fail to pay the Sh1.5 billion, then Gavi will withdraw its support, including equipment,” said the official.

According to documents seen by the Nation, Kenya has not procured the DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis) vaccine for 10 months, with public hospitals reporting shortages.

The BCG vaccine, given at birth to prevent tuberculosis, has not been procured for eight months.

Already, TB, polio, measles, rubella, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rotavirus, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), measles-rubella (MR), human papillomavirus (HPV), yellow fever vaccine and malaria vaccines are out of stock.

It is recommended that a country has at least eight months’ stock of every vaccine in its supply chain.

Kenya’s current stocks of these vaccines may be exhausted in two months. This year, the government reduced the budget for vaccines from Sh2.6 billion to Sh1.2 billion, leading to unpaid bills and a shortage of Gavi-supplied vaccines.

Last week, a spot check by Nation in public health facilities around the country established that over 27 counties had run out of stock and were in dire need of key drugs and medicines on Kenya’s Essential Medicines List.

In an exclusive interview in the same week, Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) CEO Dr Andrew Mulwa disclosed that the authority was operating from hand to mouth given that as of May 29, all 47 counties owed it a total of Sh3 billion.

Kemsa gets 90 per cent of its business from counties and supplies drugs and medical equipment, giving counties a 45-day credit period.



“We are stocked up to 70 per cent,” Dr Mulwa said.

Therapeutic foods

He said that ready-to-use therapeutic foods, TB, HIV, malaria, Covid-19, cancer, blood transfusion as well as family planning/reproductive products are the most affected.

Kemsa also procures medical supplies on behalf of the health and development partners, this is then followed up with a distribution list for delivery to various targeted populations across the country.

Council of Governors Health committee chair Muthomi Njuki, however, told Nation that the allegations that counties owe Kemsa a lot of money hence affecting the delivery of drugs is a fresh plot to return the health function to the national government through a calculated smear campaign painting the devolved units as inept.

“As it stands now, counties have not received their equitable share from the national government for three months, including June, yet, the IFMIS system reportedly slowed down from mid-June, this is why we as governors cannot pay Kemsa the Sh3billion we owe them,” the Tharaka Nithi governor said.

He accused the national government of denying counties their equitable share of about Sh100 billion, adding that had the national government stuck to the law and disbursed resources on the 15th of every month, no county would be having a debt at Kemsa.

“A debt is not bad. The agreement we have with Kemsa gives counties a repayment grace period. Counties would not hesitate to clear debts owed if they receive money from Treasury,” Mr Muthomi said.

“The national government should also prioritise settling the Sh2billion pledge to Kemsa,” he added

Kemri and CDC join hands to combat influenza,"The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are working on enhancing laboratory quality measures for influenza, biosafety and other respiratory viruses in the country.

Speaking during a capacity building workshop facilitated by CDC, Dr Festus Tolo, who represented Kemri acting Director General Elijah Songok, highlighted the crucial role that laboratory science plays in the global health landscape, particularly in the context of infectious diseases like Influenza.

In March, the Health ministry confirmed that there was an influenza outbreak in the country. The ministry’s acting Director General Patrick Amoth  disputed reports of a spike in Covid-19 cases caused by a new variant after claims by doctors  that  they were seeing patients they suspected had the JN1 Covid-19 variant.

Dr Amoth, who noted that  “the government has been looking for the JNI variant since December but no case has been reported in the country”,  disclosed that the increased number of people who were experiencing coughs and sore throat was as a result of  seasonal flu.

“None of these sites have reported an increase in the numbers of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19), but increased cases of influenza have been reported,” he said, adding that Kenya reports an upsurge in two peaks — February to March and July to November.

“The current increase in numbers is in line with the expected cases of influenza at this time of the year and there has been no significant changes in the number of hospitalisations and deaths reported,” Dr Amoth explained.

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine observes that influenza-associated respiratory illness was substantial during the emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic in Kenya.  However, recent national estimates of influenza burden in the post-pandemic period are unavailable to guide influenza vaccine policy .

Speaking during the workshop at Kemri, CDC Influenza Programme Director Gideon Emukule,  who welcomed at least 15 participants drawn from Togo, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Zanzibar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Kenya, said much more needs to be done to combat influenza in the country and the entire region.

Training and investing in experts was highlighted as a key pillar of dealing with influenza, which is why key expertise was pooled from Kenya’s National Influenza Center that is routinely involved in handling and testing specimens for various respiratory pathogens.

“Substantial efforts are ongoing worldwide to combat influenza and other respiratory viruses, this is why we have to build the capacity of laboratory professionals,” Dr Tolo said.

He noted that more funds are needed.

“With the funding and technical support from the US CDC, Kenya has been conducting surveillance for influenza and other respiratory pathogens since 2006. This support has been instrumental in carrying out research here at Kemri,” he said.

Dr Emukule provided in-depth insights into the latest advancements in influenza surveillance and laboratory practices.

“Respiratory pathogens such as influenza, SARSCoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus and others continue to pose a global public health threat and are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality burden globally. I strongly believe that this workshop has equipped you with an advanced understanding of laboratory science, microbiology/virology and Biosafety measures in laboratories.”

The workshop concluded with a call to action for continued commitment to improving laboratory standards and fostering international cooperation.

“ The collaborative efforts of the Kemri-CDC and the participating countries are expected to yield substantial benefits in the ongoing fight against influenza and other respiratory viruses,”Dr Tolo assured.

Floods aftermath: Informal women workers’ saving power diminished,"For 11 years, Mama Yusra (as she prefers to be identified), reported to her workplace every day from 6am.

Her place of work was a small temporary iron-sheet shed over an open trench in the Makina area of Kibera slums, Nairobi County. From here, she sold boiled eggs and French fries.

As a single-parent raising four children, she knew that saving was the only way she would successfully educate her children.

“I want my children to live a better life than mine. All I do, I do for them,” she says.

Read: Death and destruction as floods ravage the country

With that in mind, every week,she would put aside Sh300 from the profits earned from selling boiled eggs in a savings group of 50 women working in the informal economy.

These women do domestic work for pay, sell fast-food like Mama Yusra, trade in second-hand clothes or grocery. None of them has insurance to cover them in case of an emergency, Mama Yusra says.

She made more profits from the French fries. From the business, she saved another Sh500 every week in a merry-go-round of 10 women and every two months, she would receive her accumulated share to pay her children’s school fees.

“In the group where we save Sh 300 weekly, we get all our savings in December.  That is the time I do shopping for my children. I buy them uniforms, books, new clothes and shoes. They also feel happy to have new things. I want them to be happy that they cannot be tempted to seek happiness elsewhere,” she says.

She has three girls and one boy.

Then last April became a doom’s month for her and her household. The raging floods from the heavy rains washed away her shed. It also soaked up her household items, which need repair or replacement.

“If I use the little money I have to repair the shed, then my children will go hungry,” she says.

“I have been out of work since late April and that means I have lost many days of savings. If I remain out of work until December, then for sure, my children will be out of school and they will suffer, since I’ll have little savings in the annual savings group.”

Read: Audit exposes state’s lack of readiness to tackle floods

For women in the informal economy who depend on their irregular daily income to save, disasters such as floods greatly hurt their income flow.

And without insurance to cover the losses and help them recover, their livelihoods are highly unstable and the probability of falling into extreme poverty is particularly certain.

Mama Yusra is not the only one at risk of sinking into absolute poverty. In Kenya, women account for  more than 50 per cent of the 22.3 million working population, and 15 million Kenyans work in the informal economy where Mama Yusra falls.

There are ways of helping them get back on their feet and build their resilience to future climatic shocks. “These floods are reminders of how important it is to offer women in the informal economy social protection,” argues Grace Ananda, Africa policy and advocacy manager at Habitat for Humanity.

Social protection is a set of interventions whose objective is to reduce social and economic risk and vulnerability, and to alleviate extreme poverty and deprivation, explains the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.

These can be in the form of social assistance, which is publicly provided conditional or unconditional cash or in-kind transfers, or public works programmes.

It can also be in the form of  social insurance done as contributory programmes that cover designated contingencies affecting the welfare or income of households.

Governments can also introduce labour market protection such as providing unemployment benefits, building skills and training workers.

For now, Mama Yusra’s focus is to rebuild her business.

“My desire is to move to a better place. Not sell over an open trench. What if it rains again? Will I keep on counting losses?” she wonders.

“I'm, however, hopeful of reopening my business. But I wish the government would be more responsive and give the women whose businesses were affected unconditional grants to recover their businesses.”

Airport pledge • President William Ruto’s visit to Bungoma for the Madaraka Day, June 1, celebrations yielded goodies for the county, including a pledge to upgrade a local airstrip into an international airport, notes Dave Tumbula. “Since this is near Eldoret International Airport, shouldn’t the facility be developed in Busia Town to spread the cheer in western Kenya? This would also serve eastern Uganda.”

Let leaders heed public cry on proposed taxes,"Various associations and lobbies appearing at the public participation forums on the Finance Bill, 2024 have made it clear that there is something terribly wrong with proposed taxes.

But even before these professional groups raised their objections, there was already an outcry. For instance, this increasingly unpopular Bill includes a proposal to slap a 16 per cent Valued Added Tax (VAT) on bread, which is a common breakfast item for all Kenyans irrespective of their social status.

A few lawmakers on the government side have got into trouble for trying to explain the rationale behind the taxes. One even claimed that the bread tax was inspired by a concern about the high incidence of diabetes. This is quite pedestrian.

Insurers have warned that VAT on insurance services and motor vehicle tax could spell doom for the industry. They, therefore, called on MPs to shoot down the tax proposals in Parliament, warning that they could result in massive job losses. The Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI) says of the over three million registered cars only half are insured, mostly on third-party cover. Charging VAT on insurance, AKI warned, will hit low-income earners and small-scale businesses hard.

The Bill seeks to raise Sh58 billion from the motor vehicle tax to partly finance the Sh3.9 trillion Budget. But AKI fears the tax will reduce the demand for comprehensive cover and uptake of insurance in general.

A trade lobby has urged MPs to slash the proposed motor vehicle tax from 2.5 per cent of the value to one per cent. The Bill proposes tax of between Sh5,000 and Sh100,000 per year. The Air Transport Association (IATA) has also warned that VAT on aeroplanes will hike domestic and international travel costs.

Transport cost is a major determinant of commodity prices. High taxes on vehicles, on top of insurance premiums, will make transportation costlier, with the ultimate effect being more expensive consumer goods. The public appeal on the tax proposals should not be ignored.

Thai rice imports: Kebs to scrutinise new deliveries,"The government has said it will assess all rice imports to ensure only grain that meets acceptable standards is allowed into the country.

However, the Kenya National Bureau of Standards (Kebs) has said there is no indication that bad rice has entered the country.

Further, Kebs said it will continue laboratory scrutiny of all impending imports.

“No import will be allowed into the country unless it complies with the requirements of relevant Kenyan standards,” Kebs said in a statement on Tuesday.

Kebs was reacting to reports that Thailand is preparing to export 10-year-old grain to Africa.

“We have therefore alerted our appointed inspection agent in Thailand (SGS) of the impending government rice auction and instructed them to be on the lookout and subject all rice destined to Kenya from Thailand to mandatory inspection and testing,” Kebs said.

Read: How maize stockpiling in hope for attractive prices backfired

Last month, African diplomats raised concerns with Bangkok after Thai authorities announced a planned auction of rice that had been stored for 10 years ostensibly to recoup storage costs.

According to local officials, Thailand plans to auction this week some 15,000 tons of rice and export it to Africa, targeting up to $7.4 million in revenues from sales.

The grain is a remnant of a failed rice pledging programme by then Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra who encouraged farmers to grow more grain and supply it to the government at a predetermined price.

The scheme failed after Thai rice became uncompetitive and authorities estimated to have lost up to $13 billion in a scandal that forced Yingluck to flee the country and change nationality.

The officials did not indicate which countries the grain was headed to. However, several African countries, including Kenya, consume some of its white rice.

Thai rice is also consumed in South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Mozambique, and Côte d'Ivoire.

According to the Thai Rice Exporters Association, Thailand sold some 4.6 million tonnes to Africa.

“We became concerned because we don’t know the quality of that rice, which has been in the stores for 10 years. We don’t know the health status of that rice. We have not seen it ourselves. So we started to have some fears that somebody wants to sell bad rice to us,” said Lindsay Kiptiness, Kenya’s Ambassador to Thailand and the Dean of the African Diplomatic Corps in Bangkok.

“Why not to other parts of the world? The world is made up of six continents. Why Africa? We have a duty to protect the health of our people. It is not bad to consume old rice if it has been kept well. Old rice is not bad, but there is a danger that it can have aflatoxins,” he said.

Kebs said the age of the rice is not an issue as long as it meets certain standards.

Usually, the regulator uses three kinds of standadisation for milled rice (KS EAS 128: 2023), (Rough/ paddy rice- Specification and Brown Rice- Specification (KS EAS 764 and KS EAS 765) which are enforced by both countries of origin and destination ports of entry inspectors.

These standards do not prescribe shelf life for rice but Kebs says exporters must indicate the crop year, packing date as well as best-before-date.

They must also indicate the level of aflatoxin or heavy metals presence to confirm the suitability of rice for human consumption since physico-chemical properties do not significantly change if the rice is properly stored.

Sakaja lifts suspension on approvals of building plans,"Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has lifted the order he issued during the recent heavy rains suspending all approvals of architectural plans in Nairobi.

As a result construction work and the approvals of building plans and excavations at construction sites will resume.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Office of the Governor said professionals and representatives of stakeholders in the city would now have a say in the approval of building plans.

“Arising from this, the Nairobi City County Government (NCCG), through the acting County Secretary’s office, has written to various stakeholders requesting them to forward names of professionals and representatives who will now form part of the task force. The task force shall convene on the 12th of June to commence the audit exercise across the city,” the statement reads in part.

Such groups have been asked to complete their work and submit a report to the Governor's Office for implementation within the next two months.

“The task force shall convene on the 12th of June to commence the audit exercise across the city. The task force has 60 days to complete its work and submit a report to the Governor’s office for implementation.”

Governor Sakaja has also lifted the suspension of permit requirements and the exemption of fee payments for flood-related repairs and renovations (walls and buildings).

In addition, the governor has reconstituted the Urban Technical Committee (UPTC), inviting new representation from stakeholders including architects, urban planners, environmentalists and engineering bodies.

The UPTC is the committee responsible for deliberating and recommending the granting of building permits.

Sakaja's new directive comes in the backdrop of a court case filed in the City Magistrate's Court by Mr Victor Odhiambo.

Read: After flooding, 497,783 learners did not return to class: report

The petitioner argued that it was unconstitutional and a violation of the right to fair administrative action under Section 4(3) of the Fair Administrative Action Act for the governor to suspend construction work.

Mr Odhiambo had also said such orders should have been made by the County Executive Committee (CEC) member responsible for Urban Planning, Stephen Mwangi.

“The planning Authority with respect to county government planning functions means the County Executive Committee Member and not the Governor. Any communication on planning matters should therefore fall under the ambit of the said County Executive Committee Member,” Mr Odhiambo said in his petition.

Mr Odhiambo further faulted the governor for issuing the order without statutorily supported or backed by a gazette notice, and that there was no conduct of public participation by the County Government regarding the matter.

“Growth is a continuous exercise and it is unfair to scuttle it without a just cause. Compliance issues should be continuous and not based on the governor’s fiat,” the petitioner said.

The case will be heard and determined on June 6, 2024.

Ugandan murder suspect who escaped from custody rearrested,"A Ugandan national who escaped from lawful custody has been re-arrested by police in Kirinyaga County.

The suspect, who is suspected of murder, was seized on Tuesday when police officers stormed his hideout at Kangai village in Mwea Constituency.

Acting on a tip-off from the public, the officers took the suspect by surprise, seized and whisked him off to Sagana Police Station where he is being held for questioning.

Confirming the arrest, Kirinyaga police commander Andrew Naibei said the suspect will be charged with escaping from lawful custody.

He thanked area residents for helping the police to flush out the suspect from his hiding place.

""The residents cooperated with our officers, making it easy for us to trace and re-arrest the suspect,"" he said.

On Friday last week, the suspect sneaked out of Kiamaciri Police Station where he was being held while awaiting to be charged with murder.

Following the escape, two police officers, who were on official duty, were arrested.

The two officers will be charged with aiding the suspect to escape from lawful custody.

Kirinyaga County Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss Jason Mworia said the suspect is now heavily guarded and would soon be arraigned.

Mr Mworia cautioned residents against employing strangers.

""Residents should hire farmhands they know for their safety. Some of the people seeking to be employed as casual labourers are notorious criminal,"" said Mr Mworia.

The suspect went into hiding in November last year after he allegedly murdered his employer, Rose Muthoni Kariuki, at Kombuini village in Mwea and escaped with her mobile phone.

The deceased was found inside her house with blood oozing from the mouth and nose. The deceased also bore bruises on the neck.

Neighbours and family members became suspicious when they failed to see the deceased and decided to check on her.

That is when the body of the deceased was discovered inside her house.

The farmhand, who is believed to have had a hand in the murder, was missing from the homestead of the deceased.

Residents said the deceased woman, who was 64 years old at the time of her death, had been living alone before she met her death.

""The deceased had employed the young man from Uganda to work in the farm as her children were away from home,"" one of the residents said.

They described her as a humble, God-fearing and friendly person who did not deserve such a painful death.

The suspect was later arrested but escaped while being taken back to court.

Detectives travelled to Uganda and flushed him from his hideout and re-arrested him.

When the suspect was arrested the residents and the family celebrated. But their joy was short-lived when the suspect walked out of the heavily guarded police station unnoticed.

Detectives explained how they tracked down the mobile phone number of the suspect and caught up with him at his hideout and brought him back to Kirinyaga where he allegedly committed murder.

The phone belonging to the slain employer was also recovered from the suspect.

Court revokes Nakuru widow's estate control rights for concealing husband's Will,"The High Court in Nakuru has revoked the grant of letters of administration issued to Bhavna Karia, the widow of the late Nakuru-based lawyer Sandeep Manilal Karia.

This was after the court was told the deceased left behind a Will.

Justice Hedwig Ong’udi revoked the earlier ruling, noting that Bhavna had concealed material facts and misled the court when she petitioned for the letters of administration in December 2021.

Justice Ong’udi stated that Bhavna chose to proceed with her application despite knowing about the will, which is currently the subject of a grant of probate application before the Supreme Court in Australia.

""There is no doubt that the administrator knew that the deceased had left a Will but decided not to bring the same to the attention of the court whether the same is valid or not. It was for the court to rule on its validity,"" ruled Justice Ong’udi.

The will was brought to the court’s attention by Sandeep's brothers, Nalin Manilal Karia and Sunil Manilal Karia, who objected to the grant to their sister-in-law.

Sandeep died on May 9, 2021, while receiving treatment in Gujarat State, India.

He left behind a widow but no children. Sandeep was an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and the founder of SM Karia and Company Advocates.

The disputed wealth is estimated at over Sh120 million and has become contentious between the brothers and the widow.

Bhavna petitioned for letters of administration, claiming to be the first in priority to do so in cases of intestacy and sought to inherit her husband’s entire estate as the sole beneficiary.

Bhavna's petition included cash in various bank accounts, three parcels of land in Nakuru and three high-end vehicles.

Bhavna stated that she had consulted her husband's lawyer, Henry Aminga, who informed her of the will but could not establish its location.

After filing her petition, she received a letter from her brothers-in-law in Australia informing her of the will in their possession.

She received an authenticated copy of the will dated February 4, 2003, on November 10, 2021.

Despite this, the brothers filed a protest on June 14, 2022, accusing Bhavna of misleading the court to obtain the grant through fraud.

They claimed they had informed her about the will, but she proceeded with the case. They presented correspondence with Bhavna's lawyers and a copy of the original will to support their claim.

The will named Sandeep's brothers, Nalin and Sunil, as executors and his father, Manilal Visram, as an alternative executor.

Sandeep left gifts of Sh17 million (100,000 pounds) for his wife and Sh50 million (300,000 pounds) for his sister Darsha Sunil.



His brothers were bequeathed Sh108 million (650,000 pounds) held at Barclays Bank, now Absa.

The deceased left all his funds and monies in India to his wife and three parcels of land in Nakuru to be shared equally among his five nephews and nieces.

The brothers argued that the will is pending a grant of probate in the Supreme Court in Australia, filed in May 2022, and sought to have the grant issued to Bhavna revoked.

The court faulted Bhavna for not disclosing this information.

""In my opinion, the acts by the administrator and her own admission as stated above amounted to concealing of material facts which ought to have assisted the court in arriving at a just decision. This was an outright breach of Section 76 (b) of the Law of Succession Act and the same warrants a revocation of the Grant of Letters of Administration issued to her on December 20, 2021,"" ruled Justice Ong’udi.

Kibiko land row: Tension as two factions hold parallel elections,"The battle for control of the Sh100 billion Kibiko Ranch intensified on Tuesday, June 4 after two factions held parallel elections.

The exercise, which saw the factions led by long-serving chairman Moses Parantai and the other led by Moses Monik elect their leaders, came after the Kajiado County security team led by County Commissioner Joseph Taari cancelled the May 24, 2024 elections, citing insecurity and poor preparations by the national government.

In a public notice dated 3 June 3, 2024, Mr Taari said: ""Due to some security concerns arising from the purported annual general meeting of the Keekonykie Community Trust to be held at Kibiko grounds on June 4, 2024, the county security committee has declared the grounds a no-go zone.""

Read: Subdivision of controversial Kibiko land suspended

He said the order had been communicated to the two factions who had agreed to cancel the purported meeting. He said police officers have been mobilised to ensure that no one is allowed near the venue from midnight on June 3, 2024, to 6pm on June 8, 2024. He advised community members to avoid the venue for their own safety.

However, by 6am on Tuesday, the Parantai-led team had erected tents for the exercise, but a contingent of heavily armed police removed the tents and cordoned off the area, forcing the two groups to move further inland.

By acclamation, the Monik faction declared themselves the winners and left the venue to celebrate in the towns of Ngong, Kiserian and Isinya.

""My group had the right to call the elections, and the members unanimously elected me as their leader, I will do justice to all, external forces have lost,"" said Mr Monik.

At Kibiko ground, hundreds of Parantai supporters declared him as their duly elected chairman before swearing in his seven-member team. Three lawyers led him to take the oath of office and handed him the certificate. Mr Parantai blamed the Kajiado County Commissioner for postponing the elections, saying he had no power to do so.

Read: Lenku distances himself from controversial Kibiku land

""The 25-year struggle has come to an end, we will now move forward and subdivide the land to our members, the members have spoken,"" Mr Parantai said on Tuesday.

Mr Taari told the Nation that the elections on both sides were a sham and would not be recognised by the county security team, adding that the court would decide whether or not the elections were conducted according to the set guidelines.

The elections were crucial for Keekonyokie Community Trust Land members, as the person elected as chairman would oversee the subdivision of the prime 2,800-hectare, multi-billion-shilling land at Kibiko Ngong.

How Meg Whitman overcame disability and transformed eBay,"Before she became the US ambassador to Kenya, Margaret “Meg” Whitman developed an optimistic outlook. This excessive power of positivity, permitted the Princeton economics graduate and Harvard MBA bearer to transform eBay into the largest online auction platform.

In 1997, Meg operated a $600 million division at Hasbro, where she developed the business art of scaling, which enhanced her favourite business activity of solving problems. By the time she joined eBay as president and CEO in March 1998, she could instil cohesive management techniques that created eBay’s innovative success.

The company’s sophistication ensured anyone on the planet could post pictures of their products while interested clients and would bid and efficiently pay through PayPal, which was Meg's pivotal acquisition that she purchased as a subsidiary of eBay for $1.5 billion. The online auction procedure enabled Meg's development of new skills and capabilities that reverberated with clients, as the company grew larger.

Read: To succeed, enjoy what you do... and do what you enjoy

The trust she placed on people granted Meg the opportunity to set a stretch goal in September 2000, when eBay hosted its annual Analyst Day. A stretch goal is a financial projection that provides specific numbers for an institution's forecast. With eBay revenues totalling $430 million, Meg predicted that eBay would be a $3 billion company by 2005, to provide her team with an aim.

Mary Meeker, a savvy analyst who adjudicated eBay for wealth management firm Morgan Stanley, expressed her displeasure. She chastised Meg's public commitment to a specific long-term number as reckless and stupid. Mary was assured that failure to attain that goal would suggest weakness of leadership, planning, and execution, which could eventually frighten shareholders.

Unscathed, however, Meg surged on. She artfully implemented a sound business plan that consisted of a strong value proposition, which translated seamlessly into her talent pool. Her stretch goal was heeded exceptionally well as an inspirational rallying cry.

Soon, eBay began realising soaring revenues while decompressing numerous liabilities. Meg's new product innovations were consumed with receptivity by eBay users and created new emerging online markets, including the US automotive auction industry.

Meg (1)

It was at eBay, where Meg primarily adopted the chief principles as highlighted in her memoir, The Power of Many: Values for Success in Business and in Life. She led eBay from a $4 million company in March 1998 when she was hired to a $400 million business, as she transformed and scaled her managerial skills. By 2005, eBay had hit $4.5 billion in revenues, superseding her projection of $3 billion five years earlier. It went on to grow with distinction to an $8 billion virtual auction global brand, with a prosperous global marketplace.

During her tenure at eBay, the company advanced so rapidly. Meg responded by ingeniously adding exciting new acquisitions of physically disabled staff to her portfolio. Her corporate social responsibility was inspired by her childhood experience of overcoming disability.

When Meg was a newborn, her parents took her to a special hospital in New York City and doctors discovered she had dysplasia, an unusual congenital bone defect that resulted in her left hip having no socket. The hip is a ball and socket joint, the socket being a curved enclosure that contains the top of the large bone of the upper leg that allows the leg to rotate and move. In Meg's case, the surface of the hip against which her leg rested was flat instead of curved, causing the joint to become inherently unstable.

If left untreated, the implications of a child with this would result in permanent disability because the leg bone would not sit snugly in the socket, and would constantly dislocate when the child moved. When Meg began to crawl, doctors repeatedly asserted that she had to be placed in a stiff metal brace and leather straps that literally pushed her leg into her hip to create the socket.

Read: Meg Whitman, envoy with Midas touch on business

Her stroller and baby carriage were also modified to allow her legs to point out sideways, and when she was not being wheeled, she had to be carried everywhere. The strategy was to maintain a constant, steady pressure on her soft toddler bones to create the socket. It miraculously worked. It was, however, challenging for the family. Even after the braces were removed when Meg was two, she was not allowed to stand and apply weight on her hips for another six months.

When her family received permission from the doctors to let her play freely, the results were remarkable. She could walk, run and jump, just like any other child. She had no pain, and received a moment of self-validation when she gravitated to playing sports, including basketball, lacrosse and swimming, which were critical to developing her adulthood character traits of persistence and perseverance and were eventually fundamental to her administrative success.

To her delight, as eBay grew, Meg aligned the company’s principles to nurture the talents and restore the courage of the physically disabled. She integrated an entire community of staff consisting of physically challenged individuals, and explored their intellectual energy and resourcefulness, while eliminating enormous stigma that surrounded their preconceived notions and abilities. Having experienced the fright of disability, she resonated with the disparity of the physically impaired.

"Gatundu South MP Gabriel Kagombe denied bond in murder case, to remain in custody","Gatundu South MP Gabriel Kagombe, who was arrested over the death of a boda boda rider David Nduati Wataha, will remain in police custody until Friday after the High Court in Machakos declined to free him on bond.

At the same time, a Kiambu County MCA Peter Mburu Mungai was charged at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi with conspiracy to commit crime through publication of false information regarding the land for construction of a modern market before the killing of the rider.

Mr Mungai , a relative of a senior employee in the Kiambu County Government Patrick Ng’ang’a Mungai, and Mr Kagombe were arrested by crime busters on Friday in connection with the killing of Mr Wataha.

“The arrest and detention of Kagombe (MP), Mungai (MCA Kamenu Ward) and Ng’ang’a revolve around the construction of the modern market within Thika Municipality,” defence lawyer Njiru Ndegwa told magistrate Ben Mark Ekhubi.

Before High Court Judge Francis Rayola in Machakos, Mr Kagombe did not take a plea as the prosecution applied to be allowed to take him for mental assessment before he can be asked to answer to murder charges.

Justice Rayola directed the police to take him to Kiambu County Referral Hospital for a mental assessment tomorrow before he is formerly charged on Friday.

“On whether or not the accused person should be released on anticipatory bond terms as issued in Kiambu on miscellaneous application number 804/24 is a matter of further litigation,” ruled the judge.

The plea to release the lawmaker on bond was opposed by the State counsel on the basis of the information which had been filed, stating that bail is not permissible at this stage.

“On this score I do agree with the State counsel that anticipatory bail granted only applied before charges are filed. Once formal charges are filed, the same anticipatory bail is overtaken by events and the accused person will apply for new bail/bond terms once formally charged before this court,” Mr Rayola ruled.

Trouble befell the first-term MP when he accompanied National Assembly Majority Leader and Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wah, Gatundu North MP Elijah Njoroge, Thika Town MP Alice Ng’ang’a and other Kiambu politicians to commission a proposed market project a fortnight ago.

He is accused of opening fire when two groups of Kiambu politicians and their supporters clashed over the market project.

According to a charge sheet seen by Nation, the Director of Public Prosecutions is planning to charge the lawmaker with killing Mr Nduati.

“On the May 17, 2024, at around 4:30pm at Kimuchu in Makongeni Location in Thika West Sub-County in Kiambu County, he murdered David Nduati Wataha,” reads a section of the charge sheet seen by the Nation and signed by Gikuhi Gichuhi, an assistant Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The MCA and Ng’ang’a were released on a cash bail of Sh350,000 until June 19,2024 when further directions will be given.

Mburu and Ng’ang’are denied they published false information that land No.Thika Municipality Block 30/1825 in Kiganjo within Kamenu Ward Kiambu County belonged to Kiganjo Location Ranching Co.Ltd and it had been handed over to the National Government for the Construction of Kiganjo Kamichu Mordern Market.

Kenya’s policy on family faulty on many fronts,"Anyone interested in social issues would be excited about the National Policy on Family Promotion and Protection 2023 published by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. But that excitement lasts only until you read the document.

The policy defines a family as “a societal group that is related by blood, adoption, foster care or the ties of marriage of two persons of opposite sex” (sic). This disqualifies intersex persons from marriage.

Similar discrimination is inherent in the Marriage Act, which defines marriage as “a voluntary union of a man and woman”. In chapter two, the policy defines a family as “a unit of people connected by natural genealogical links”, which is at variance with the earlier definition.

Read: Reimagining marriage and its original values

The document regrets that the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics collects information on the family but has never synthesised this into a thematic report. Thus it recommends a state of the family report after every five years.

At different points, the words “family” and “household” are used interchangeably, yet these are distinct concepts.

The statement that “polygamous households are one of the types of families found in Kenya” makes it manifest that the authors lacked a coherent approach to classification of families.

In addition, the analysis of challenges facing the family is extremely superficial and uninformed, probably an indication that no sociologist was involved in developing the document.

Under marriage in chapter three, the document observes that existing legislation does not provide guidance on how to “strengthen the marriage” but does not clarify what is meant by that phrase.

Read: Married but single: The wives paying all the family bills

What is clear is that the policy champions a normative ideology that marriage is imperative. Thus, it states that “the key policy issues are related on how (sic) to promote a culture of marriage” so that the result is “a true foundation for social order in Kenya”.

This seems to suggest that without families, there can be no social order.

The policy then proposes some vague but conservative interventions to be undertaken by the government.

These include promotion of “gender-responsive and age-appropriate programmes that help people understand sexuality framed in the context of marriage as the best option,” encouraging and promoting “dispute resolution mechanisms that safely keep couples together,” promoting “values and life skills programmes that encourage chastity and strengthen the marriage institution,” and protecting “the family institution from disruption by not allowing emerging cultures”.

Although the meaning of “emerging cultures” is not stated, it is a veiled reference to non-binary sexual orientation.

Read: Every marriage is pregnant with divorce, let’s leave room for the latter

Inlaid in these proposals are some ludicrous assumptions. One is that it is the government’s responsibility to keep couples together. This arises from the notion that marriage is a union in which people should, and can be coerced to, stay even if it is dysfunctional.

The other is that it is the government’s role to ensure sexual fidelity within marriage, notwithstanding that adultery is not a crime in Kenyan statutes. The superintending role given to the government is tantamount to meddling and erosion of the autonomy and responsibilities of couples.

The document creates the impression that Kenya is just about to invent something called the family and needs a framework on how to make it functional. The vagueness of the policy proposals means that an implementer would be at a loss as to what to do practically.

What kind of action, for example, would one initiate under the intervention to “integrate family needs in planning and property/assets acquisition and disposal?” The proposals are also littered with the word “promote,” technically an escapist and lazy way of making commitments that are not measurable.

This document has glaring, irritating and embarrassing grammatical errors. Sample this. “The role of men in ensuring family fulfils this primary function is paramount. Empirical evidence has made abundantly clear that involved and caring fathers are important to the optimal development of children.

Read: If you were to grade your marriage, what would you score?

Whether it is biological, adoptive or stepfathers, living in or outside of the home, fathers impact their children at every stage of development, and their absence has long last repercussions.”

The policy lists various statutes of relevance to the family but curiously omits the Law of Succession (Amendment) Act and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act.

The section on family safety and security does not even feature obvious types of violence such as spousal battery, rape and incest.

Reading this document leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It makes one wonder whether government officers who approved and signed this product actually read it.

In short, this is a pedestrian document that should not be called a national policy. The ministry would do the country a lot of justice by withdrawing it for a total overhaul.

G7 leaders 'fully endorse' Joe Biden's Gaza peace plan,"Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies ""fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive"" ceasefire and hostage release dealfor the Gaza war outlined by U.S. President Joe Biden and call on Hamas to accept it, a statement said on Monday.

The deal ""would lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for distribution throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and Gazan civilian safety assured,"" the statement said.

The G7, of which Italy holds the rotating presidency for 2024, reaffirmed support ""for a credible pathway towards peace leading to a two state solution.""

Biden laid out what he described as a three-phase Israeli ceasefire proposal last week, winning a positive initial reaction from Hamas.

An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Sunday that Israel had accepted the framework deal for winding down the Gaza war, though he described it as flawed and in need of much more work.

""We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,"" the G7 statement said.

"Grit, determination won Kenya swift promotion Word Rugby Sevens Series","



Kenya returns to a much-changed terrain in the Word Rugby Sevens Series that requires great effort and skill to survive in.

While Kenya suffered relegation to the World Rugby Challenger Series, World Rugby came up with a different format for the World Rugby Sevens Series starting from the 2023/2024, reducing the number of teams from 16 to 12 in both men and women’s series.

On Sunday in Madrid, Kenya, the United States of America, Uruguay and Spain won their play-off matches to qualify for 2024/2025 World Rugby Sevens Series, where they will join eight other teams. Kenya Sevens coach Kevin “Bling” Wambua reckons nothing is impossible with determination.

It is the sort of confidence that has driven Kenya Rugby Union chairman Sasha Mutai to declare that Kenya Sevens is back in World Rugby to stay, adding that he has faith in the transformation KRU has undertaken to regain core status.

But what won Kenya Sevens promotion back to the World Rugby Sevens Series after a season out?

Transform the team

When coach Wambua took over from Damian McGrath who was sacked last August, few gave him and his young team a chance of winning promotion just so soon, let alone qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Wambua’s team was given four months to transform the team.

Kenya Sevens was relegated from the World Rugby Sevens Series for the first time in 23 years last season after losing the promotion and relegation play-off.

Wambua took over at a time when Kenya Sevens and the country was at its lowest ebb. Following the team’s relegation, senior members of the squad retired almost in the same period. One of Kenya’s greatest moments in the World Rugby Sevens Series was when they stunned Fiji 30-7 to win the 2016 Singapore Sevens.

The team had reached the main Cup final four times; in 2009 (Adelaide Sevens), in 2013 (Wellington Sevens), in 2018 (Canada Sevens), and in 2018 (Hong Kong Sevens).

Wambua inherited a team that had lost Collins Injera, William Ambaka and Billy Odhiambo to retirement last year.

Other players who retired at their prime include Eden Agero, Bush Mwale, Augustine Lugonzo, Oscar Ouma and Oscar Ayodi.

Wambua’s first assignment was the Africa Cup, and he picked a young squad, recalling only three seasoned players - Vincent Onyala, Anthony Omondi and Herman Humwa - to the squad.

Patrick Odongo (Daystar), Samuel ‘TinTin’ Asati (KCB) and Nigel Amaitsa (Strathmore Leos) were some of the new players in the team. Kenya shocked South Africa17-12 in the final in Zimbabwe last September. to qualify for the 2024 Olympic Games. For the third consecutive time, Kenya will compete at the Olympics.

Beating Samurai Barracudas

They then retained Safari Sevens title, beating Samurai Barracudas 19-0 in the final, a performance that saw Wambua’s tenure as the coach extended to 2026.

Kenya Sevens rode through the three-leg World Rugby Challenger Series in Dubai, Uruguay, and Germany and finished in the top four to qualify for the promotion and relegation play-offs in Madrid where Kenya earned promotion to the top series. SportPesa’s return as sponsors with Sh126 million sponsorship in December 2022 eased things for Kenya Sevens.

“Dare to dream but more importantly, dare to put action behind your dreams,” Wambua said of the team’s winning mentality.

“We have the right people at the technical bench but there are no shortcuts in high performance. We must expose this young team to quality tournaments,” said Mutai, adding that they hope to draw the top team for Safari Sevens ahead of the World Series in December.

Team captain Vincent Onyala thanked everyone who believed and trusted in the team and above all God.

“The coaches, new talent and everyone believed in the new direction we took,” said Onyala.

Inside new state policy that recognises 'come we stay' and sex education in schools,"On May 15, 2024, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection launched the National Policy on Family Promotion and Protection, a framework seeking to safeguard the institution of family as provided for in Article 45 of the Constitution.

The policy is pegged on the order of maintaining the constitutional status quo of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society, pivotal to creating social order as it functions as an entity for educating, nurturing and caring for its kin.

What kind of marriages exist in Kenya?

The policy recognises nuclear, polygamous, blended, extended, as well as child-headed and skip-generation or grandparent-headed families.

It equally acknowledges the existence of a “kind of marriage” arrangement in the name of cohabitation, where an unmarried couple lives together in a long-term relationship that resembles a marriage.

This type of marriage is, however, unrecognised under the Marriage Act (2014), and becomes problematic when parties go separate ways and demand a share of what they built together.

Single-parent families are also recognised in this policy, breaking the tradition of looking down on these families. While it attributes the rise of these families to only imprisonment, migration, death, abandonment, divorce or separation, other painful factors force women and girls into single-parenthood. Some women and girls have become single parents out of the post-election violence, incest, gang-rape and defilement in their own communities.

Read: Silence that kills a marriage

In the slum areas, teenage girls as young as 13 years are willingly opting for marriage to seek financial, emotional and physical support because their own families can’t provide these needs. Unfortunately, they end up being abused, and when they can’t take it anymore, they exit to become single-child parents.

The policy seeks to promote gender-responsive and age-appropriate programmes that help people understand sexuality framed in the context of marriage as the best option. Is this the best option?

“It is important to recognise that in this era of urbanisation and globalisation, age-appropriate programmes will not be homogeneously palatable to the targeted family members. What is considered age-appropriate in Nairobi may not apply for a family in Bungoma or Kajiado. So we must do research to understand what is best for different families,” argues Chryspin Afifu, a gender and development expert.

“We have to think of the power imbalances in the households, socioeconomic status of the family members and access to digital devices. These days, children access online content way above their age through mobile phones or even laptops. How can we control that to protect families?”

What is the current mood of debate on “sexuality education”?

For the past two decades, the church, especially the Anglican and Roman Catholic, has vehemently refused to allow the introduction of age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education, which essentially is to prepare the children for adulthood.

Yet, the reality on the ground, backed up bystudies, is that children are having a sex debut as early as eight years depending on their environment. Those in the urban slum areas and in the poor households in the rural parts of Kenya are at the highest risk of early sex debut, an easy gateway to early marriage and contracting HIV.

In 2003, the same church unsuccessfully protested against the introduction of setbooks A Man of the People, Kiu, and Kitumbua Kimeingia Mchanga, arguing that they were pornographic and sexually explicit.

In reality, some schools, especially private ones, have embraced sexuality education in their programming for even their kindergarten pupils. Often, they are delivered in poems, and songs, and through clubs and counselling or physical exercise sessions.

The way to changing the mood from repulsive to receptive

“Let’s have a discussion. What is the cause of the opposition? Sometimes the church opposes these interventions in public but in private, in their own homes, they cannot control whatever they are protesting against.

Let’s face the reality as it is and ask ourselves, what is the worst-case scenario if we introduced these programmes? What is the weight of the losses and gains? What is the long-term damage of the opposition to the targeted groups?” Mr Afifu puts forth.

Kenyan becomes first black mayor in Northern Ireland,"A Kenyan woman who made history after being elected councillor in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, was yesterday inaugurated as the first black mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council.

Ms Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who is from Mau Narok in Nakuru County, was voted to represent the Foyleside area of Derry and Strabane Council in Northern Ireland.

During the handing over ceremony ON Monday, June 3, Ms Seenoi-Barr received the mayoral chain in the presence of five Kenyans, including her brother, Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina.

“Originally from Narok, Kenya, Lilian has dedicated her life to championing human rights, social justice, and community cohesion. With a background in social work, community development and social policy, Lilian has been instrumental in fostering integration and understanding among diverse communities in Northern Ireland,” said the introductory notes.

Marginalised groups

It was her work with local organisations focusing on supporting marginalised groups, promoting equality, and enhancing community relations that attracted her to the Social Democratic and Labour Party.

“Her leadership and dedication have earned her widespread respect and admiration, both locally and nationally. Lilian's historic appointment as mayor signifies a significant step forward for Derry and Strabane, reflecting the region's evolving diversity and commitment to inclusivity,” said the briefing.

Senator Ole Kina yesterday wrote a tweet on his X handle, formerly Twitter: “With outgoing Mayor of Derry City Patricia Logue and incoming Mayor Lillian Seenoi-Barr ahead of the official handover happening today at Guildhall, Derry City. Lillian is the first black mayor. It’s a proud moment for Kenya. She comes from Narok.”

Other Kenyans present during the ceremony were Kenya’s Deputy Head of Mission Edwin Afande, Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna and Nominated Senator Prof Margaret Kamar.

Mr Sifuna said on X that he did not only attend the inauguration, but also toured some sites.

“A tour of the Museum of Free Derry has evoked terrible memories of our own experiences with police brutality and State sanctioned violence on peaceful protesters. It took over 12 years and millions of dollars for the victims of Bloody Sunday in Derry to be vindicated. Justice comes, eventually,” he wrote.

Senate Speaker Amason Kingi, who was chief guest, congratulated the new mayor for breaking the glass ceiling.

“Today’s installation of Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr is the latest in the irrepressible rise by women to high leadership positions not just here in Ireland but globally,” said Mr Kingi, adding it’s clear proof of the gains of democracy.

"‘I refused the 'cleansing' ritual that assumed I was unfaithful’, a widow’s horror","In 1996, Jane Wairimu lost her husband when she was six months pregnant with their last child. At the time, she was 29, residing in Bungoma, Western Kenya.

She had met her husband while working at the Agricultural Finance Corporation, and they had three children together. Their marriage was peaceful and happy. However, after his sudden death, she encountered unexpected challenges.

She shares with Nation.Africa how she was treated after becoming a widow and her seven-year journey of reclaiming their matrimonial property.

“Even though my husband was the fourth-born child, he was the most successful in his family, therefore the provider. Although his family owned land in Mumias, we decided to purchase property and settle in Bungoma, where his successful business ventures thrived. When he was alive, he was attentive to our needs,” Jane recounts.

Unfortunately, Jane’s husband died in South Africa in a tragic road accident. His secretary, Claudia, who was also a Bukusu woman, delivered the news to her. Strangely, before breaking the news, she suggested that they have lunch at her home.

Read: Let’s talk about the law of succession

When they arrived at her home, Claudia began rummaging through their belongings in the master bedroom. When Jane questioned her, she dismissed her concerns and urged her to eat.

Claudia then requested her marriage certificate, which Jane handed over without hesitation. Then, out of nowhere, she posed a chilling question: ""What would you do if you found out your husband had died?"" Shocked by her inquiry, Jane was rendered speechless.

Claudia’s subsequent words only heightened her distress, as she instructed Jane to prepare to wail, as is customary for Bukusu women upon hearing of their husband's demise.

Stunned and unable to react, Jane watched as Claudia swiftly gathered their important documents and some of her husband's personal belongings and took them to her car. Returning to the room, she began screaming. According to the Bukusu tradition, such screams serve to alert neighbours of the tragedy.

“As I remained paralysed by the unfolding events, my in-laws seized the opportunity to enter our home and strip it of our possessions. Fortunately, Claudia had foreseen their actions and hidden away their vital documents. Amidst the chaos, I felt too powerless to intervene,” she says.

With the government’s assistance, her husband's body was airlifted to Kenya and funeral preparations began.

Read: Widowed? Here’s a simple guide to property succession

Before the funeral, Jane was instructed by her in-laws not to shower, citing Bukusu cultural practices. According to tradition, female relatives in the community were supposed to perform a cleansing ritual on her. This ritual supposedly ensured her stability when circling her husband's grave seven times during the funeral procession. However, Jane adamantly refused to undergo this ritual, opting instead to maintain her usual hygiene practices.

Jane explains to Nation.Africa that this practice stems from the assumption that widows may have been unfaithful, and the cleansing is intended to prevent any mishaps during burial rites.

Following the funeral, Jane faced mistreatment from her in-laws. They seized all the dairy cattle from their zero-grazing unit and even took away the tractor used for farming. This marked the beginning of her frustrations.

“Despite the challenges, I chose to remain in my matrimonial home because my children were young and I was heavily pregnant. However, I decided that once I gave birth, I would relocate to Nairobi.”

Once she arrived in Nairobi, she had intended to start succession processes but was too afraid to do so.

Legal process

“I faced opposition from my in-laws. To make matters worse, my mother-in-law was living on the property, and the land's title deed only listed my late husband as the owner. On top of that, my in-laws threatened to take away my children if I decided to pursue legal action to reclaim our home.

""I was afraid of the consequences it might have on my children and the strain it could put on their relationship with their grandmother, so I hesitated to take the matter to court,"" she says.

It was after three years that she regained the courage to begin the legal process of reclaiming her property. Looking back at her hesitation, Jane admits that since her husband had not left behind a will, it was difficult.

Read: Just like sons, daughters are entitled to inherit deceased parent’s estate

Claudia had managed to sneak out crucial documents from their home, including title deeds for all of her husband's properties. On perusing the documents, she was astonished to discover that besides the 16-acre Bungoma property, her husband even owned property in South Africa.

Her efforts necessitated her to constantly make trips from Nairobi to Bungoma to attend court. This eventually led to her losing her job. Her employer terminated her contract because she had “deserted her duties”.

Despite lack of support from her relatives, she remained determined to seek justice for herself and her children. With the assistance of a compassionate lawyer and her own resilience, Jane navigated the complex legal process and eventually regained control of her assets.

What Jane went through is common among widows. This is why the Law of Succession Amendment Bill, 2023, is currently under consideration in the Senate. The bill aims to address several issues within the existing law, particularly focusing on the rights of widows.

We spoke to Senator Veronica Maina, the sponsor of the bill, and she explained that she introduced the bill because there are inconsistencies in the current Law of Succession, particularly when it intersects with marriage laws.

“These inconsistencies impact the definition of who inherits. Inheritance laws relate closely to family structures, which begin with marriage. Some definitions in marriage laws conflict with those in the Law of Succession, leading to discrimination against certain family members or dependents.”

One of the notable proposals in the bill is the introduction of the definition of intermeddling under section three of the Law of Succession Act. The definition includes removing a spouse or child from the matrimonial home after the death of a husband or father as an offense under the act.

“I know of a lot of widows who as soon as their husband dies, the in-laws swoop in and take possession of everything, leaving the bereaved family, including young children, in distress. If the bill is passed, such practices would be recognised as an offense under the Act and punishable within the law,” Veronica told Nation.Africa.

In a joint statement about the bill, Dianah Kamande, founder and executive director of Come Together Widows and Orphans Organisation, and Groots Kenya executive director Rachel Kagoiya explain what the provision would be helpful to widows like Jane.

“This means that widows and their children have the protection under the Law of Succession not to be ejected from the matrimonial home after the death of their husbands and fathers respectively. It's the first time a law has expressly provided for such with a corresponding penalty even though the penalty is not stiff,” reads part of the statement.

Read: Mum didn’t leave a will, how do we handle inheritance dispute?

Other proposals to the Succession Act seek to protect children of women born out of wedlock. “The bill clarifies inheritance rights for children born out of wedlock, supporting the principle of equal distribution regardless of the child's legitimacy or the parent's marital status. This prevents any form of discrimination,” Ms Maina explains.

Further, under current law, a widow loses life interest in her husband’s property upon remarriage, but a widower does not. The bill proposes equalising this to ensure both men and women lose life interest upon remarriage, transferring the estate's benefits to their children.

As to this, Rachel says: “Widow discrimination upon re-marriage is terminated on the basis that either spouse will lose their right to claim from the deceased’s estate upon remarriage.

“It is significant for widows for they have been losing their right to claim anything from their husband's estate if they remarried whereas men continued to enjoy the protection of the same law by being able to lay claim on the estate of their wives in a new marriage.”

Key national mandate of MPs is paramount,"Members of Parliament are paid hefty salaries and allowances to articulate in the august House the concerns and aspirations of millions of Kenyans. A lot of their crucial work is done in the Chamber as they debate and make laws to improve the people’s welfare and protect their lives.

But, as leaders, there is much more work that they do in their own constituencies and in other national forums.

The huge investment in enabling the lawmakers to effectively carry out their mandate is made possible by the taxpayers.

That is why, in an interesting development, President William Ruto has felt compelled to reiterate that they have an obligation to criss-cross the country to discharge their mandate. He said they will be failing in their role as national leaders if they confine themselves to their electoral constituencies.

President Ruto has thus contradicted the position of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, clarifying that the MPs have a right to traverse the country and address national issues. Of course, the President is quite right that the oversight and legislative roles of the MPs are not limited to their specific constituencies.

UDA lawmakers

DP Gachagua recently told Rift Valley UDA lawmakers to keep off his Mount Kenya backyard, in an apparently mounting battle for the control of the vote-rich region. He is on record as having cautioned the MPs to “keep off the complex politics of the Mountain”.

According to the President, MPs execute three key constitutional mandates of oversight, representation and legislation. As he graphically put it, “Parliament is not a village assembly”. It is the national law-making arena where matters affecting the country as a whole are tackled. It is, therefore, quite in order for MPs to highlight or even lodge petitions on matters or any developments even outside their own constituencies.

Since they sit in the National Assembly, the MPs are national officials and should be concerned about issues affecting every part of the country. They are not tribal chiefs, who would only deal with matters concerning their communities.

Tapping into the future: Nakuru poly turns Ruto’s joke into reality,"When President William Ruto talked about young people making money by tapping their computer keyboards in Taptengelei village, Nandi County, the Rift Valley National Polytechnic in Nakuru City was already working on the concept.

Hundreds of young people from Njoro, Rongai, Nakuru Town East, Nakuru Town West and Molo flock to the refurbished digital hub at the institute daily.

The government-sponsored programme, under the Jitume Initiative, addresses challenges facing thousands of jobless young people in Nakuru and beyond.

These include access to digital devices and internet connectivity, training and knowledge acquisition as well as opportunities that can result in decent and dignified incomes.

The initiative encourages young men and women to take it upon themselves to access digital devices and opportunities, become certified in skills for the fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and access digital jobs.

Processing data

The digital laboratory has attracted youth from diverse backgrounds, including those who have completed training in different professions.

One beneficiary is 20-year-old Deborah Ondieki, a maritime logistics student at the Kenya School of Revenue Administration.

She has been using facilities at the Rift Valley National Polytechnic for the two months.

“I’m engaged in online work, processing data for global institutions,” Ondieki says.

“This reminds me that there is a global space outside Kenya where I can work virtually and earn my daily bread.”

She wants to save enough from her online earnings to complete her studies.

The institute works with Lish AI Labs to offer comprehensive artificial intelligence and machine learning training, enabling young adults to access digital services, skills and tech opportunities for job creation.

More computers needed

Rift Valley National Polytechnic Principal, Sammy Chemoiwa, says the institution signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Lish AI Labs to help young people develop digital skills that will make them competitive in the international job market.

“We train and mentor them for six months before sending them to the job market,” Chemoiwa says.

“We usually target those still in college and those who have completed studies. For now, we do not charge them anything. We also don’t ask for payment when they start earning.”

Some 123 students have been offered training, earning Sh20,000 to Sh25,000 a week.

“This is encouraging. Some students earn more than the average worker at the polytechnic,” the principal says.

The lab operates around the clock, with at least 80 students earning enough to take care of their meals, accommodation and other daily expenses.

The biggest challenge facing the programme is the limited number of computers. There are plans to increase the capacity of the laboratory to 1,000 computers.

“The lab only has 100 computers. We have talked to the government to provide us with 100 more for training and 200 for staff,” he says.

According to the principal, strategies are in place to help the trainees invest their earnings through saving models, government bonds, treasury bills, saccos and shares in companies.

"Keep off Amboseli National Park takeover, Kajiado leaders warn civil society groups","Local leaders have issued a stern warning to non-governmental organisations that oppose Amboseli National Park's takeover by the County Government of Kajiado.

This follows a statement dated May 14, 2024, posted by the East Africa Wildlife Society (EAWLS) on its online Swara Magazine opposing the transfer of the park to the county government and warning that the devolved unit lacked the capacity to manage such a vital natural resource.

The statement that was authored by EAWLS Executive Director Nancy Ogonje further cautioned that “transferring Amboseli National Park’s management to the Kajiado County Government represents a dangerous step backwards for conservation efforts in Kenya.”

“The implications extend far beyond the local community, impacting the nation’s wildlife governance framework and diminishing a resource cherished by millions,” said Ms Ogonje.

The conservationist regretted that such a move would set a bad precedent for wildlife governance in the country.

“By devolving park management to county administrations, we risk diluting the authority and expertise vested in institutions like the KWS [the Kenya Wildlife Service],” she noted.

Citing a similar clamour by the Taita Taveta County Government, Ms Ogonje went on to say that “the developments significantly threaten the conservation values and goals underpinning our cherished national heritage.”

Kenya's national treasures

“Our arguments are not speculative. They are grounded in legal, environmental, and ethical considerations. As stewards of Kenya’s natural treasures, we cannot afford to overlook the ramifications of such a decision.”

In 2023, President Ruto, speaking during a Maa cultural event in Narok County, ordered the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife to transfer the management of Amboseli to the County Government of Kajiado. The ministry then formed a committee to spearhead the process.

On Saturday last week, addressing residents during the Madaraka Day celebration in Ilbisil, Governor Joseph Ole Lenku reiterated his commitment to ensuring that the park was handed over to the county government.

He termed the Amboseli takeover issue as a matter of utmost importance to the Maa people, likening it to the conservation of the Mau Forest Complex and securing of Maa community land rights in Laikipia County.

“It is a battle that must be won,” the governor said. “I commend the eleven group ranches that have generously contributed a total of one million acres for the expansion of the Amboseli ecosystem conservation area.”

Kajiado Senator Samuel Seki charged that the NGOs had been paid to derail the process by their “Western masters”.

Nominated Senator Peris Tobiko urged President Ruto to pay closer heed to the grievances raised by the Maa people.

“The Maa don’t have access to State House to present their grievances to the Head of State. We have seen muguka, coffee and tea farmers hosted at State House. Amboseli is our muguka, it's our heritage,” said Ms Tobiko.

Controversial handover

Kajiado South MP Samuel Parashina called on Dr Ruto to “fulfil your promise to Kajiado people”.

At the heart of the controversial handover of the park are billions of shillings generated in revenues every year and which the county government stands to gain.

According to figures from the KWS, the income generated by the Amboseli National Park this year has already surpassed last year's figures. In March, KWS Director-General Erustus Kanga revealed that the park raked in Sh1.4 billion in 2023 compared to the Sh1.2 billion realised in 2022.

This, Mr Kanga noted, was even though 90 per cent of the wildlife in the Amboseli ecosystem in Kajiado South are living outside the park.

This means that the revenue potential is quite high with the anticipated extra one million acres of conservation area expected to be handed over to the park by local group ranches when the State cedes control.

Unexplained assets: Former City Hall finance chief Kiamba pleads with court to spare his matrimonial home,"Former Nairobi County chief finance officer Jimmy Kiamba has moved to court seeking to have his matrimonial home excluded from the list of properties to be forfeited to the State as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

Mr Kiamba, who has filed a petition alongside his spouse Tracy Musau, is also seeking to have an order issued that they be at liberty to liquidate their property to settle the claim with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).

In their petition at the High Court in Mombasa, Mr Kiamba says during the pendency of his employment, he managed to build his income by saving.

He says he used the savings and loans from banks to start wheat and livestock farming, and he later on built hotels in Mombasa and Machakos.

According to the petitioners, Ms Musau, a career interior designer, built her business from scratch through the establishment of an interior design company.

She says she later established a beauty parlor, enabling her to acquire a property that was leased out to supplement her income from the core business.

The couple say sometime in 2014, unknown to them, EACC began investigations on them and their dealings, including the registered companies they had interests in, and it formed an opinion that they were in possession of unexplained assets.

The petitioners also say EACC filed a case at the High Court to forfeit the unexplained assets, an application that was eventually granted.

The couple argue that they tendered evidence that their young family was at least entitled to the protection of the Constitution regarding rights attributable to a family, children and their presumptive right to own property.

This, they say, means that the attachment and forfeiture of their matrimonial home would render them homeless, and deprive their children of their rights.

“Part of the so-called unexplained assets, including the matrimonial home, were aptly explained to the extent they were acquired through pooling of resources of the petitioners and loans advanced by financial institutions,” the petition states in part.

Mr Kiamba and his spouse have challenged the constitutionality of some sections of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act.

They claim that some sections of the law are in direct conflict, and in contravention of the Constitution, specifically the Bill of Rights as they prescribe a procedure by which an individual is adjudged and instantly presumed guilty until proven otherwise.

According to the petitioners, the procedure laid down presupposes a mini-trial conducted by the EACC which after investigations is incumbent upon the anti-graft agency to invite rebuttal evidence before it can recommend either prosecution or acquittal of anticipated charges against the suspect.

“It is imperative that the court invokes its interrogative constitutional mandate to interpret the Constitution as invited by the petitioners relating to conflict of laws in order to safeguard the dictates and gains in criminal and quasi criminal proceedings for furtherance and protection of the rule of law,” the petition states in part.

The petitioners are seeking a declaration that Sections 55 (1),55 (2) (b),55 (6),55 (9),56 (1) &56 (2) of Aceca are inconsistent and contravene Articles 50 (2) (a),50 (2) (K),50 (2) (n),159 (2) (e) and 160 (1) of the Constitution are unconstitutional null and void.

Upon declaration of the unconstitutionality of the sections, the petitioners want a declaration that the orders of the High Court and the Court of Appeal have no force in law.

Alternatively, the petitioners want their matrimonial home situated in Runda Water Estate, Nairobi excluded from forfeiture by the state as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

The petitioners are also seeking conservatory orders among them staying implementation or execution of the judgment and orders of the Court of Appeal pending hearing and determination of their petition.

The case will be mentioned on Thursday for directions.

Police officers arrested after Ugandan murder suspect escapes from custody,"Two police officers have been arrested after a Ugandan national who is suspected of murder escaped from Kiamaciri Police Station in Kirinyaga County.

The officers were arrested after the suspect, who is the main suspect in his employer's gruesome murder, escaped from custody.

The suspect was being held at the police station after the court allowed detectives to hold him for 14 days to enable them to complete their investigations.

Kirinyaga County Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss Jason Mworia confirmed the arrest, saying the officers will be charged in court.

He said another suspect accused of committing an unnatural act and who had escaped together with the Ugandan has been re-arrested.

Dangerous criminal

The officers could be charged with aiding the suspected criminals to escape from lawful custody.

Mr Mworia described the Ugandan as a dangerous criminal who should be arrested as soon as possible.

He asked residents to volunteer information which can help detectives re-arrest the suspect who is on the run.

The suspect went into hiding in November last year after he allegedly murdered his employer, Rose Muthoni Kariuki, at Kombuini village in Mwea and escaped with her mobile phone.

The deceased was found inside her house with blood oozing from the mouth and nose. The deceased also bore bruises on the neck.

Neighbours and family members became suspicious when they failed to see the deceased and decided to check on her.

Painful death

Residents said the deceased woman had been living alone before she met her death.

They described her as a humble, God-fearing and friendly person who did not deserve such a painful death.

The suspect was later arrested but escaped while being taken back to court.

Detectives travelled to Uganda and flushed him from his hideout and re-arrested him.

When the suspect was arrested the residents and the family celebrated. But their joy was short-lived when the suspect walked out of the heavily guarded police station unnoticed.

Detectives explained how they tracked down the mobile phone number of the suspect and caught up with him at his hideout and brought him back to Kirinyaga where he allegedly committed murder.

The phone belonging to the slain employer was also recovered from the suspect.

Sheinbaum elected Mexico's first woman president,"Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become Mexico's first female president, inheriting the project of her mentor and outgoing leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador whose popularity among the poor helped drive her triumph.

Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City, won the presidency with between 58.3 per cent and 60.7 per cent of the vote, according to a rapid sample count by Mexico's electoral authority. That is set to be the highest vote percentage in Mexico's democratic history.

The ruling coalition was also on track for a possible two-thirds super majority in both houses of Congress, which would allow the coalition to pass constitutional reforms without opposition support, according to the range of results given by the electoral authority.

Opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez conceded defeat after preliminary results showed her taking between 26.6 per cent and 28.6 per cent of the vote.

""For the first time in the 200 years of the republic I will become the first woman president of Mexico,"" Sheinbaum told supporters to loud cheers of ""president, president"".

Victory for Sheinbaum is a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture and home to the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.

Sheinbaum is the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

""I never imagined that one day I would vote for a woman,"" said 87-year-old Edelmira Montiel, a Sheinbaum supporter in Mexico's smallest state Tlaxcala.

""Before we couldn't even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,"" Montiel added.

Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.

Read: Trump is a convicted felon. Now what?

After preliminary results were announced, she told supporters her government would be fiscally responsible and respect the autonomy of the central bank.

She has vowed to improve security but has given few details and the election, the most violent in Mexico's modern history with 38 candidates murdered, has reinforced massive security problems.

Many analysts say organized crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during Lopez Obrador's term.

Sunday's vote was also marred by the killing of two people at polling stations in Puebla state. More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico's modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down.

""Unless she commits to making a game-changing level of investment in improving policing and reducing impunity, Sheinbaum will likely struggle to achieve a significant improvement in overall levels of security,"" said Nathaniel Parish Flannery, an independent Latin America political risk analyst.

The ruling MORENA party also won the Mexico City mayorship race, one of the country's most important posts, according preliminary results.

Among the new president's challenges will be tense negotiations with the United States over the huge flows of US-bound migrants crossing Mexico and security cooperation over drug trafficking at a time when the U.S. fentanyl epidemic rages.

Mexican officials expect these negotiations to be more difficult if the U.S. presidency is won by Donald Trump in November.

Trump has vowed to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese cars made in Mexico and said he would mobilize special forces to fight the cartels.

At home, the next president will be tasked with addressing electricity and water shortages and luring manufacturers to relocate as part of the nearshoring trend, in which companies move supply chains closer to their main markets.

Sheinbaum will also have to wrestle with what to do with Pemex, the state oil giant that has seen production decline for two decades and is drowning in debt.

""It cannot just be that there is an endless pit where you put public money in and the company is never profitable,"" said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs. ""They have to rethink the business model of Pemex.""

Lopez Obrador doubled the minimum wage, reduced poverty and oversaw a strengthening peso and low levels of unemployment - successes that made him incredibly popular.

Sheinbaum has promised to expand welfare programs, but it will not be easy with Mexico on track for a large deficit this year and sluggish GDP growth of just 1.5 per cent expected by the central bank in 2025.

Lopez Obrador has loomed over the campaign, seeking to turn the vote into a referendum on his political agenda.

Sheinbaum has rejected opposition claims that she would be a ""puppet"" of Lopez Obrador, though she has pledged to continue many of his policies including those that have helped Mexico's poorest.

In her victory speech, Sheinbaum thanked Lopez Obrador as ""a unique person who has transformed our country for the better"".

But political analyst Viri Rios said she thought sexism was behind criticism that Sheinbaum was going to be a puppet of the outgoing leader.

""It's unbelievable that people cannot believe she's going to be making her own decisions, and I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that she's female,"" she said.

Kenya Shujaa bounce back to World Rugby Sevens Series,"Kenya Sevens are back at the World Rugby Sevens Series.

Kenyans broke into song and dance in Madrid and locally after Shujaa touched down five tries and four conversions to dismantle Germany 33-15 in the relegation and play-off duel in the Spanish capital.

“Welcome back Kenya, we have missed you!” said World Rugby on their social media pages.

It was a battle of resilience as Shujaa braved a poor start and one-man disadvantage in the first half, turning around their fortunes with good defence and open play.

Vincent Onyala, Chrisant Ojwang, John Okoth, George Ooro, and Kevin Wekesa bludgeoned through a try each as Anthony Mboya added the extras to send Kenya back to the series after a season in the cold.

It’s Chris Umeh, who completed a good flow with a try on the left corner that went unconverted before Shujaa turned in the style as Onyala touched down. Mboya converted as Shujaa took charge 7-5 only for Ojwang to be sin-binned for infringement.

Kenya Sevens players celebrate their qualification for the 2025 HSBC World Rugby Sevens season after beating Germany 33-15 in the World Rugby Sevens Series play-offs in Madrid on June 2, 2024.

Shujaa held on the Germans with good defence but it capitulated for Niklas Koch to score for the Germans to lead 10-5.

However, Ojwang returned from the sin-bin with a bang, tearing through the wing after being put through by Samuel Asati to score and even Mboya missed to convert Kenya's lead 12-10 at the break.

Onyala would latch on the kick-off loose ball to feed Okoth with a telling cross before he went flying through the poles to score. Mboya added the extras to stretch the lead to 19-10.

There was some flash of brilliance from Germany, who had beaten Kenya twice in the World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series. Maximilian Heid brought them back into the game with a try to reduce the deficit at 19-15 only for Kenya to go loose and wild with the ball.

Substitute Brain Tanga set up Ooro from the maul to go flying between the posts as Wekesa collected a loose ball after the German defence fumbled with the ball to score.

Mboya was good with his boots as the buzzer went to elicit celebrations from the players and Kenyan fans to bring back the memories from the 2016 Singapore Sevens where Kenya won the leg.

Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Sasha Mutai said the qualification is a result of hard work from several key movers in the game from last year starting with the players, technical bench, union, the government and sponsors.

“We put the right people at the technical bench through merit and that is why player selection was also on merit. There is no good luck at the top level,” said Mutai, adding that regaining the core status will not only improve the standards of players but also the Safari Sevens.

“There are no shortcuts in high performance and that is why I want to thank the National Olympic Committee of Kenya, the government and Sportpesa for the support,” explained Mutai.

Safari Sevens

Mutai said that top teams will now grace the Safari Sevens ahead of the World Series in December. "" But first things first, we must prepare well for medal contention at the Paris Olympic Games,"" said Mutai.

Mutai hailed Kenya Sevens coach Kevin “Bling” Wambua for the transformation in the team.

Team captain Vincent Onyala thanked everyone who believed and trusted in the team and above all God.

“The coaches, new talent and everyone believed in the new direction we took,” said Onyala.

Wambua took over from Damian McGrath, who was fired in August last year before his contract came to an end after the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

Unlike his predecessors, who had the luxury of a long-term contract, Wambua’s team was given a four-month contract that Sasha Sasha, who had just been elected KRU chairman, described as a “transition period.”

It was left to be known if Wambua, who is conversant with the intrigues in Kenya Sevens team management, would survive for long considering the revolving door that is Kenya Sevens coaching job.

McGrath's exit saw the high turnover of coaches at the Kenya Sevens team continues with the job having now changed 12 times since 2010.

Wambua took over at a time when Kenya Sevens and the country was at its lowest ebb after the team was relegated from the World Rugby Sevens Series for the first time in 23 years.

Top players

He came at a time when some of the country’s top players handed their boots almost the same time singling for Collins Injera, William Ambaka and Billy Odhiambo who called it quits last year. Others who retired before their prime age are Eden Agero, Bush Mwale, Augustine Lugonzo, Oscar Ouma and Oscar Ayodi among others.

However, Wambua confounded many when he guided his young team which had only three senior players to Africa Cup victory, shocking South Africa’s Blitzboks 17-12 in the final in Zimbabwe in September last year.

That victory saw them qualify for the Paris Olympic Games, the third consecutive time they will participate in the Olympics Summer Games.

They would then retain Safari Sevens, beating Samurai Barracudas 19-0, the final that saw the rise of Patrick Odongo, a student from Daystar University, who scored a brace of tries.

Co-captains Vincent Onyala and Anthony Omondi, and Herman Humwa were the only senior players in the team with the latest retirement of Collins Injera, William Ambaka and Billy Odhiambo last year among others.

That performance was enough to see Wambua's tenure as the coach extended to 2026.

Wambua’s next assignment was the World Rugby Challenger Series where they emerged second with 48 points behind Uruguay with 56 points.

Kenya Sevens launched their campaign in the three-legged series in Dubai, beating Chile 12-5 in the final. They then finished third in the second leg in Montevedio, Uruguay, once again edging out Chile 31-12 in the playoffs.

Kenya settled fifth in the final leg in Munich, Germany but had already done the work to finish in the top four and qualify for the promotion and relegation play-off in Madrid.

Kenya Sevens earned their first call for the World Rugby Sevens Series in 2000/2001 season before becoming the core team in the 2004/2005 season.

Gachagua defends his push for Mount Kenya unity,"Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has maintained that his call for regional unity was genuine, saying this would lead to national unity and development across the country.

Mr Gachagua said contrary to some leaders’ accusations that his unity call among Mt Kenya leaders was tribal, he was for Kenyans speaking in one voice first from the regions, which would cascade to the well-being of the nation.

During his Madaraka Day address, President William Ruto told leaders to shun politics of regional kingship, and asked them to unite.

The President said his administration would deliver development equally across the country regardless of how they voted in the 2022 general election.

But speaking on Sunday, June 2 at the Lady of Visitation Catholic Church in Timau, Buuri constituency in Meru County, the DP explained his call for regional unity, saying his interest was to see each region coming together first followed by national unity.

Supremacy battles

“When we call for regional unity, it is not that we want to be united against anybody or for any other reason. It is because unity brings about development since we are able to push our agenda. Unity in the region is very important and we should not be isolated for being united because that would be retrogressive. Why would somebody isolate us because we are united? Is unity a bad thing? We should not go to another election while divided and we don’t want to get there,” Mr Gachagua said.

He said when leaders in Kericho, Kiambu and Meru counties were fighting against their governors, he stepped in and brokered peace. He, however, noted that Meru County had not yet stabilised, with Governor Kawira Mwangaza and MCAs still engaged in supremacy battles.

The DP said that through unity in western Kenya, leaders were able to secure over Sh100 billion waivers on debts owned to the sugar sector, while leaders from the northern Kenya are speaking with the same voice, negotiating for the interests of their region.

“People from different parts of the country have peculiar interests that you discuss as a region and take them for negotiations at the national table,” he added.

“It is in everybody’s interest that all leaders work together. This is the only way that development will be realised. There was a problem in Nakuru and we sorted it out. If all regions are united we will seek partnerships and it will be easy for us to negotiate as a region. I am a peacemaker and under President William Ruto we’re all together,” the DP said.

Mr Gachagua recalled that when Kenya Kwanza won the election he was a bitter man because I had been wronged and fought a lot.

“But through prayers and with the assistance of my wife, Dorcas, I have forgiven them all. Don’t stab your brother on the back. Let’s embrace the culture of forgiveness among ourselves,” he added.

Mr Gachagua called for forgiveness between Governor Mwangaza and MCAs, saying all elected leaders must work together for any meaningful development to take place in a county.

Ms Mwangaza, her Laikipia counterpart Joshua Irungu, Buuri MP Mugambi Rindikiri, Senator Alexander Mundigi (Embu County), Meru Woman Rep Elizabeth Kailemia, MPs Moses Kirima (Imenti Central), Rahim Dawood (Imenti North), Mpuru Aburi(Tigania East), John Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South), Jayne Kihara (Naivasha), James Gakuya (Embakasi North), Wachira Karani (Laikipia West), George Koimburi (Juja), Kamande Mwafrika (Roysambu), Gachoki Gitari (Kirinyaga Central), Peter Kihungi (Kangema), Dorothy Ikiara (Nominated) and former Laikipia County MP Cate Waruguru accompanied the DP.

Meru MCAs led by Majority Leader Patrick Mutuma and Timau MCA Martin Muriungi, were also present.

Speaking on Saturday night in Nanyuki, Mr Gachagua asked leaders from Mount Kenya region to name and shame some local leaders being used by outside forces to scuttle his unity push in central Kenya.

A few traitors

He said the few traitors were guns for hire, but noted that the community had always had such characters right from the time of the Mau Mau war.

“The issue of sell-outs within our community is not something new. There were individuals who collaborated with the colonial masters for some short-term personal benefits instead of sacrificing for the greater good of the larger community,” he said.

Mr Gachagua reiterated his push for more allocation of resources through the one-man-one vote-one-shilling formula and termed Mount Kenya leaders opposed this push as working on the behest of enemies bent on causing disunity.

“Whenever they come visiting in the rural areas, let them explain their stand on the one-man-one-vote-one-shilling and if they support my bid to unite the mountain. Those who do not support and fail to accompany me whenever I am drumming up support for unity should be earmarked for voting out when the time comes,” he said.

The DP who was accompanied by over a dozen MPs drawn from Nairobi, Kiambu, Nakuru, Murang’a, Nyeri, Laikipia and Meru counties said he would not abandon his agenda of uniting the mountain so that the region could raise its stakes on the political bargaining table.

Laikipia East MP Mwangi Kiunjuri who has differed with the DP on his approach in uniting the region, was conspicuously absent during the evening musical extravaganza at Old House Restaurant.

Nairobi UDA camps fight for supremacy in grassroots polls,"Two rival factions have now emerged in the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Nairobi branch as the ruling party holds its grassroots elections across the country.

One wing that backs Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has claimed victory in the just-concluded ward elections. Mr Sakaja is vying for the position of Nairobi UDA boss.

After successful elections on Friday, the governor claimed that candidates allied to him had secured 240 out of 340 delegate positions.

On the other hand, there has been silence in the camp of Embakasi North MP James Gakuya, who is also eyeing the UDA chairmanship.

On Wednesday, when Governor Sakaja held a delegates’ meeting at the Bomas of Kenya, he alleged that his opponent, Mr Gakuya, is a project of a senior party official.

Mr Sakaja congratulated his supporters who won their respective elections at the ward level and stressed the importance of unity.

The governor urged his supporters to come together and drum up support for the team as they gear up for the remaining ward elections, and eventually the polls for the chairperson’s seat.

“We shall not be divided by tribal politics, we shall pursue unity for a better Nairobi,” Mr Sakaja said.

But Mr Gakuya accused the governor of using goons to disrupt the peaceful election in Starehe Constituency, which were postponed by the party.

Final vote

Nairobi South Member of County Assembly Waithera Chege, who is among the agents of Mr Gakuya, maintained that the MP will emerge the winner in the final vote.

“Governor Sakaja must accept that the chairman of Nairobi County is Mr Gakuya because numbers don’t lie,” Ms Chege said.

She also alleged that some voters were being allowed to cast their ballots using identification cards that belong to other people.

“Police officers in civilian clothes were voting in Starehe. Sakaja has disrupted the county assembly, and he has now come to cause confusion in Starehe. It is high time that he accepted that Nairobi, and especially UDA members, have said that enough is enough,” Ms Chege said.

The attempts to reach Mr Gakuya for comment were not successful.

Last Wednesday, while addressing delegates that support him, the Mr Sakaja accused his opponents of advancing politics of ethnicity.

At the same time, the governor said that it was wrong for Deputy President to fuel infighting in UDA party that is headed by President William Ruto.

The DP and Mr Sakaja have for long been reading from different scripts, which has resulted in some of the governor’s development plans being delayed.

The governor dismissed allegations that the Nairobi governor’s seat was handed to him on a silver platter. He said that he was duly elected by the residents of Nairobi.

Mr Sakaja claimed that his opponent for the UDA Nairobi branch chairmanship position, Mr Gakuya, is a project.

“Let me tell you this, the one I’m competing with is not a candidate. He is a project,” Governor Sakaja said while addressing hundreds of UDA ward delegates at the Bomas of Kenya on Wednesday

"Sword-wielding motorist attacks, injures police officer in Kasarani","A police officer is currently recuperating at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital after being attacked by a sword-wielding motorist he had arrested and was escorting to Kasarani Police Station.

According to police records, the corporal was on duty at Mirema junction on Kamiti Road on Sunday, June 2, morning when he spotted a motor vehicle making a U-turn and obstructing other road users.

This prompted the officer to approach the vehicle to clear the road for other users. However, when the driver saw the officer and attempted to flee, he swerved and, in a moment of miscalculation, hit the kerb and got stuck.

As he struggled to remove the vehicle from the kerb, the officer managed to enter the vehicle and instructed the driver to drive to the police station.

""Upon reaching the Quick Mart (supermarket), the driver suddenly stopped and pulled a sword from under the seat. The officer jumped out of the vehicle for his own safety and the driver followed him with blows and kicks,"" read part of the police report.

In the melee, the officer tripped and fell into a ditch, giving his assailant time to grab his mobile phone battery before taking off.

The officer, who was rescued by members of the public, later received first aid at Crestview Mother and Child Wellness Centre in Kasarani. He was transferred to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital for further treatment.

Meanwhile, an accomplice in the attack is in police custody as police intensify efforts to track down the driver who is still at large.

Voyage zaps Betfred Epsom Derby,"It is true we have heard it before, but usually in the Grand National. Pat Dobbs was unseated on Voyage 28-1, a few seconds after the Betfred Epsom Derby, but he carried on regardless.

Voyage was on a mission to succeed, no matter what. And he did. But sadly, it was nullified without Pat at his helm. It was very entertaining, mind you, as the other fifteen runners carried on being serious. Declared the greatest of Aiden O'Brien's ten Derby Classic titles, City of Troy (Ryan Moore 3-1), stayed mid-division as Euphoric set ablaze with Los Angeles.

Dallas Star, Mister Hampstead and Ancient Wisdom, all having a brief commentator airing. Ryan then asked City of Troy to step on the pedal. Ambiente Friendly (Robert Havlin 9-2), gave a good account of himself in second, although he did lose a couple of lengths negotiating Voyage's will to finish.

Los Angeles (Wayne Lordan 6-1), retained third, from Deira Mile, Sayedaty Sadaty, Dancing Gemini, Bellum Justum, Ancient Wisdom, Euphoric, Tabletalk, Kamboo, God's Window, Macduff, Dallas Star, and, Mister Hampstead.

Between thanking Coolmore Stud and Ballydoyle, Aiden again went back to the errors he had made before City Of Troy's comeback in Qipco's 2,000 Guineas. ""We knew it went wrong. He was too fresh, unprepared and blew up in the stalls when he went in – and that's the reality of it.

Ryan Moore, winning his fourth Derby, once again proved the perfect partner for a pressure-cooker occasion, although he admitted City Of Troy's initial speedy response caught him unawares.

""We were able to pick a path and he took me there fluently. The race was over and he was in control of it a fair way out. Still a little bit inexperienced with Voyage in front of him, Troy was too special to worry about it.""

""He showed so much as a two-year-old and it's great that Aidan has got him back, didn't lose faith in the horse, stuck to the plan and it paid off. We believed if he turned up like we thought he would he'd be too good for them – and he was.""

Although Aiden usually heaps praise on Ryan in these moments, the maestro reversed roles as he paid tribute to a genius.

""He's been breaking records for so long now it's ridiculous – there's no one like him. It's more than being a genius with attention to detail and dedication. Everyone works hard in this game, but I've never known anyone work harder than him. Before his defeat at Newmarket, City Of Troy had been spoken about as both a potential Triple Crown hope and a Breeders' Cup Classic challenger. He could yet bid to seal his legacy on dirt in the United States.

""It's always been our passion to try and win the Classic,"" said Michael Tabor, part-owner of City Of Troy with Sue Magnier and Derrick Smith. ""We were second with Giant's Causeway and, being by Justify, surely we'll give it a try eventually.""

Electricity transformer theft menace: Government deploys police officers to trace criminals,"The government has assigned groups of police officers in Homa Bay County the responsibility of tracking and smoking out criminals who engage in theft of electricity transformers.

The officers will work together with other agencies to make sure that criminals who steal the transformers are apprehended and arraigned.

County Commissioner Moses Lilan said the region has become synonymous with power blackouts caused by vandalism of public infrastructure, especially electricity transformers and power lines.

He said a team of police officers was trying to address the menace by tracing the criminals.

""The officers are drawn from the Critical Infrastructure Police Unit (Cipu). Vandalism of transformers must stop,"" Mr Lilan said.

Kenya Power has been reporting huge losses caused by vandalism and theft of its equipment used for supplying electricity to homes and businesses.

Mr Lilan said the latest case in Homa Bay happened in Rangwe where unknown individuals stole transformers and dumped them at a field in Rangwe Town alongside a vehicle that was used to ferry the stolen gadgets.

""Another incident was reported in Omoya. These are just a few reported incidents,"" the county commissioner said.

When transformers are stolen, criminals break them open to steal copper wire and cooling oil.

The copper is sold to scrap metal dealers for recycling.

Mr Lilan described people involved in the illegal business as economic saboteurs who do not wish the county to grow.

He compared the act of stealing transformers to terrorism saying criminals found to engage in the business will be charged accordingly.

""Whoever puts a whole village or a neighbourhood into darkness for a whole week or a whole month are economic saboteurs,"" Mr Lilan said.

The CIPU team has been tasked to investigate the theft of Kenya Power property and report the cases and arrest suspects.

""We cannot allow criminals to use transformers for their own benefits. I don't know where they take the oil,"" he said.

Gachagua wants Mt Kenya ‘traitors’ to be named and shamed,"The political tension in Mt Kenya has escalated as Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua called on the region to name and shame some local leaders being used by outside forces to scuttle his unity push in central Kenya.

Mr Gachagua who spoke in Nanyuki Town, Laikipia county on Saturday night said the few traitors were guns for hire, but noted that the community had always had such characters right from the time of the Mau Mau war of independence.

“The issue of sellouts within our community is not something new. There were individuals who collaborated with the colonial masters for some short-term personal benefits instead of sacrificing for the great good of the larger community,” he said.

Mr Gachagua reiterated his push for more allocation of resources through the one man-one vote- one-shilling formula and termed Mt Kenya leaders opposed this push as working on the behest of enemies bent on causing disunity.

“Whenever they visit the rural areas, let them explain their stand on the one-man-one vote –one shilling and if they support my bid to unite the mountain.

""Those who do not support and fail to accompany me whenever I am drumming support for unity should be earmarked for voting out when the time comes,” he said.

Kenya to gain from Sh1.7bn pest control options,"Kenya is among nine low and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America that will benefit from more than $13 million (Sh1.7 billion) in funding by CropLife International to boost pest management.

CropLife is a global trade association of agrochemical firms based in Belgium.

The five-year funding, dubbed Sustainable Pesticide Management Framework (SPMF), is on in Kenya, Morocco, Thailand and Vietnam.

According to CropLife, the SPMF is rooted in the industry’s foundational commitment to the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management.

It also paves the way for the adoption of new technology to support the demand for sustainable alternatives and practices such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

The programme makes specific reference to Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHPs). It is envisaged that by 2035, stakeholders will have taken effective measures to phase out HHPs in agriculture.

It is also expected to yield safer and affordable alternatives; and to promote transition to the alternatives.

Farmers are learning to control an increasing number of new invasive species.

“With a warming planet, tackling pollution, protecting biodiversity and boosting food security are complex and interlinked challenges. They must be addressed in a horizontal, holistic and inclusive manner,” said Emily Rees CEO of CropLife International

CropLife launched SPMF together with BASF Agricultural Solutions, Bayer Crop Science, Corteva Agriscience, FMC Corporation, Sumitomo Chemicals and Syngenta AG in 2021.

As global temperatures rise, there has been a dramatic increase in invasive pests and diseases, which in combination with water scarcity challenges affect overall crop productivity, she said.

Kajiado County raises concern over toxic Ipomea weed,"The Kajiado County government has declared toxic Ipomea weed a disaster because of its negative effects on pastures.

The pasture-colonising weed, known as 'oltiameleteti' in the Maa dialect has spread rapidly across Kajiado County since 1997, when it was first discovered after El Niño rains, and now occupies at least 40 per cent of the total land area.

During Madaraka Day celebrations on June 1, Governor Joseph Lenku launched the Ipomea uprooting exercise to be replicated by pastoralists across the vast county.

""This weed has become a monster that threatens our food security. The weed has thrived due to poor land use, including overgrazing in a small part of the grazing land. The only way to eradicate this weed is to uproot it,"" said Governor Lenku.

He is keen to partner with other stakeholders to eradicate the weed, especially now that the county is on the path to modulated pastoralism.

""Although the county government is implementing several programmes to eradicate the weed and boost livestock production, additional funding is needed. The eradication of the plant requires a holistic approach,"" he added, saying that researchers at the University of Nairobi have initiated advanced research on how to scientifically eradicate the weed.

Kajiado Senator Samuel Seki said he has petitioned the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock through the Senate seeking answers on the government's preparedness to eradicate the weed that has spread to most Arid and Semi-Arid counties.

""I am waiting for the ministry's response on its preparedness to eradicate the weed. Both levels of government should allocate funds to eradicate Ipomoea and I want a replica of the 'Kazi Mtaani' programme to be rolled out for youths in the affected counties,"" said Senator Seki.

Kajiado County Director of Livestock Eric Aheda said the plant has a high seed rate, heavy foliage, well spread and developed root system, aggressive natural pasture competitor and smothers natural pasture in its proximity.

""This weed is highly adaptable to harsh conditions and outperforms the traditional grass. Despite the recent heavy rains, pastoralists will soon face fodder shortages,"" he said.

Kajiado West, South, Central, East and North sub-counties have borne the brunt of the weed, causing panic among pastoralists.

""The highly invasive plant, which is inedible to livestock, has spread so fast. Livestock farming seems untenable in the near future,"" said Mr Moses Lenkaso, a pastoralist.

Mr Sankare Japan, a pastoralist from Kajiado Central Sub County, told the Nation that the weed has affected honey production in the county.

""The highly flowering weed attracts bees and in return, the honey produced makes consumers doze off after consumption. The honey is said to be of poor quality and unmarketable.""

Ipomoea belongs to the sweet potato family. This species is reported to be a recent weed colonising rangelands in Kajiado County. The species is characterised by prolific growth, and a beautiful inflorescence and is highly responsive to even marginal rainfall. The weed can grow to a height of more than 2 metres and a stool can spread up to 4 metres in diameter.

The weed exacerbated the severe drought of 2020-2022 in Kajiado. Hundreds of livestock succumbed to the drought, shaking the food security of the local community, and at least 350 families faced starvation, according to the National Drought Management Authority.

The county's livestock sector has seen its annual turnover drop from Sh3.2 billion to Sh1 billion in the past three years.

Lake Olbolosat begins to show signs of life after the long rains,"The recent long rains have brought a glimmer of hope for the restoration of Lake Olbolosat. The lake's water capacity has increased to 40 per cent, a significant improvement from its previous level of less than 10 per cent in March.

The sole highland lake in central Kenya had completely dried up, resulting in increased conflicts between the local community and hippos. This situation changed with the onset of the El Nino rains.

""The boats are back, there are vibrant activities within the lake and visitors are back. Last weekend, we attended to more than 300 customers visiting to enjoy the serene environment, boat riding, hippos, and bird watching. We need to sustain the pace,"" said Mr David Ng'ang'a, the Lake Olbolosat Beach Management Unit (BMU) chairperson.

Mr Ng'ang'a applauded the community's efforts to restore the lake, saying the journey will be more fruitful if every community member joins the efforts.

He further called on the county and national government to support the community’s campaigns to reach all the lake’s catchment areas.

""We have some underground water tunnels running as far as Mirangine and Ndondori Hills that empty into Lake Olbolosat,"" said Mr Ng'ang'a.

Lake Olbolosat's catchment areas include Satima escarpments to the east and Ndundori-Tumaini ridge to the west. It also gets its water from direct rainfall, underground springs and rivers that flow from Ol Joro Orok area.

""We cannot classify this as flood water. The rains are heavy, so the amount of inflowing water is also massive, that is why it looks more like flood water,"" said Prof John Githaiga, an environmental expert at the University of Nairobi.

Prof Githaiga added that the water flows into the lake in a spectacular and muddy state due to different factors. He noted that the impacts of prolonged drought and overgrazing on the environment around the lake have affected the inflow.

He was concerned that after the heavy rains stop, the lake's present water level may fall due to inefficient catchment and reduced water holding capacity, causing it to dry again during the dry season.

""Having water today would not mean that the lake has been revived. We need to ensure that the water is there and continues coming into the lake for a prolonged period. That is why we have to restore and manage our ecosystem so that we do not go through this periodic dry and flooding time again.”

Forest conservation, according to environmentalists, sustains ecosystems. While the community around Lake Olbolosat has planted trees that have yielded fruit in the lake's restoration, there are concerns about the lake not achieving its full restoration due to harmful trees like eucalyptus planted around it.

Some residents have been reported to be reluctant to uproot the eucalyptus trees.

The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) has listed Lake Ol Olbolosat among the priority wetlands because of its unique features.

Caroline Muriuki, principal wetlands officer at Nema, said the wetland restoration strategy aims to direct efforts towards saving the lake.

""The lake supports five other counties downstream. So, if we lose it, then we are losing the Ewaso Nyiro River, which supports five other counties downstream and, significantly, the pastoralist community. That is why it is a priority for us to see to it that the lake is restored,"" Ms Muriuki told participants during a science café organised by the Media for Environment, Science, Health and Agriculture in Nairobi.

This is the first-ever wetland restoration strategy developed by Nema. Ms Muriuki said the legal framework will guide activities done by different players in wetlands management and conservation. One of the activities she hopes to achieve is uprooting eucalyptus trees around the lake.

""Planting the eucalyptus on the riparian areas of wetlands is more destructive than helpful to the wetland. As much as we want vegetation cover, specific vegetation can be planted on those riparian areas to help conserve the wetlands,"" said Ms Muriuki.

She encouraged planting bamboo trees around the lake because they have diverse benefits for the ecosystem and support community livelihood.

""Bamboo has a commercial value. It is also good in holding the ground around the riparian land that is usually losing soil that ends up in the wetlands and causes siltation and shallowing of the wetlands, which is now happening at Lake Olbolosat.”

Her sentiments were shared by Mr Wachira Mugo, Nyandarua’s Water, Environment, Climate Change and Tourism Executive.

""The lake is facing serious challenges of siltation, water abstraction from Aberdare Forest and River Malewa, encroachment and grabbing, and many other challenges that are about to fast consume the highlands lake in Kenya,"" said Mr Mugo.

However, Jabes Okumu, programmes and advocacy manager at The East African Wild Life Society, warned that the return of Lake Olbolosat, due to its shallow depth, may expose the population to flooding disasters.

""We are likely to witness an increase in the flood plains and expose communities around that area to flooding. Wetlands are meant to regulate water flow, and by the time it starts to flood, it means the carrying capacity of that wetland is exhausted, so the water has to flow,"" said Mr Okumu.

He added that it is not yet time for the community to celebrate the lake's rebirth. He said the 40 per cent water capacity might diminish when the heavy rains stop, which might affect water quality and the ongoing activities within the lake.

He added that their research shows that when the lake dried, people blocked the water from streaming into it through farming activities and domestic use. He is concerned that history might repeat itself once the heavy rainfall stops.

""Drying of the lake is a complex thing. Beyond it being shallow and at a high altitude, we also have a lot of anthropogenic pressures. Out of the over 10 springs and streams that we marked, we found a lot of water abstraction, leaving the lake with little water supply,"" said Mr Okumu.

Inside the mass translocation of herbivores to Lake Jipe Conservancy,"“We are planning a mass capture this time round. Are you interested in covering this?” Liz Gichuki from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) communication team asked me on the phone. I had never heard of such before.

“What does that consist of?” I asked, curiously.

She explained that the KWS team was going to capture a bunch of herbivores en masse and translocate them; and that the exercise would involve a helicopter.

Fast-forward to our arrival at the 28,000-acre Taita Taveta Wildlife Sanctuary, part of the vast Tsavo ecosystem and home to the herbivores that will no longer call this place home. They’ll be moved to the relatively new Lake Jipe Conservancy,  further south, to boost the number of species that exist there.

Re-introductions or introductions of species to a particular habitat are part of regular wildlife management. And when secure space for wildlife is limited due to urbanisation and land use changes, the request for more animals to populate Lake Jipe Conservancy is welcome.

Dr Isaac Lekolool, the head of veterinary and capture services at KWS, explains: “Over the last few years, there has been a huge decline of wildlife numbers. So, whenever we get an opportunity to win space for wildlife, we grab it because such opportunities are rare.”

The mission is to capture and translocate 20 zebras and 20 hartebeests, or kongonis – a large, fawn-coloured antelope. But capturing wild animals is no easy task, and for this particular exercise, the KWS team must build a trap large enough to hold the animals, and one that looks somewhat natural. They first identify an area relatively close to where the animals have been sighted. Using poles and canvas, they skillfully build a funnel-like structure that is wide at one end and gradually gets narrower towards the other end. It’s a job that takes almost two full days to complete.

Help from above is also required for this mission, and that is in the form of a helicopter, which will be used to sight the animals and drive them towards the capture site.

But why not just dart them and load them into the truck?

Campaign Limo, a KWS vet and a professional spotter, explains: “The drugs we use for immobilising animals are imported and very expensive. So, if you can drive them at once, you avoid the cost of drugs, save time and capture the animals at a go. You avoid anaesthesia and the reversal drug for those animals, so you’re just pushing them when they’re conscious, in a comfortable state”.

During any kind of capture and translocation, a high survival rate of the animals is critical, and they must not get too stressed.

The team sets off with the aim of spotting and driving the zebras towards the site first as they are the smarter species compared to the kongonis, and they could present more challenges.

After about 10 minutes, a herd is sighted. But the loud helicopter noise frightens the zebras and they start running away. Captain Koech skillfully maneuvers the chopper to keep up with them. The herd runs towards the bushes. They pick up speed, and so does the helicopter. They turn around and finally, Captain Koech drives them towards the capture site.

But the mission is not yet over. The zebras realise something is not looking right, and they turn around. Captain Koech is not giving up. He maneuvers again, and the zebras run faster. It eventually becomes too challenging to keep the herd together, and they escape. The zebras have outsmarted humans.

Day two.

The team decides to be less ambitious with the animals they target first. The search for the kongonis is on. These antelopes don’t carry a reputation of being very smart.

Soon, a herd is spotted at a distance, from the air, and the herding process begins. Kongonis are one of the fastest antelopes and most enduring runners — capable of reaching speeds of up to 70 kilometres per hour.

This time round it’s more straightforward, and the kongonis run straight into the trap. The partition is quickly closed to block them from escaping.

Now back to the zebras.

The team spots a smaller herd of zebras. With precision, Captain Koech pressures them into the contained space. They know they’ve been trapped and run around, looking for an escape, but they have nowhere to run, except towards the funnel.

The partitions close in on them, but still, they’re determined to find a way out.

It gets dramatic. The team has to chase the herd with sticks. Finally, the last partition is closed.

The zebras walk through the funnel into the truck. It’s a win for the capture team —  six zebras and 12 hartebeests have been captured.

The truck sets off immediately for Lake Jipe Conservancy, as the animals shouldn’t be kept waiting for too long — any male zebra present in the crate could start attacking the females out of aggression.

After a two-hour drive, the animals arrive at the 1,400-acre conservancy, where vegetation and water are abundant. The ecosystem will also benefit from their presence as these herbivores graze on hardened grass that is difficult for other herbivores to digest, making way for tender leaves and grass to grow. They are also expected to boost tourism here.

In 2021, KWS populated the conservancy with 22 zebras, seven wildebeests and two hartebeests. Today, there are almost 300 animals at the conservancy.

"In Bungoma, Ruto announces more goodies for coffee farmers","Coffee farmers received a major boost on Saturday after President William Ruto announced measures to revive the sub-sector into a profitable investment.

The reforms include a Sh6.9 billion debt write-off for coffee cooperatives and the allocation of a Sh4 billion coffee cherry fund.

The Head of State, who was speaking at the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations held at Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi, Bungoma County, said the reforms are aimed at increasing coffee productivity and enabling farmers to make profits from the investment.

“Measures are underway to boost coffee productivity from 2kg to 10kg per tree and from 50,000 metric tonnes to 102,000 metric tons a year by 2027,” said Dr Ruto, noting that the strategic interventions have led to increased value-addition initiatives.

2024/2025 financial year

He disclosed the payment of Sh2 billion of the Sh4 billion Coffee Cherry Fund, while the Sh2 billion balance will be paid in the 2024/2025 financial year.

The initiatives, he said, will ensure that coffee farmers receive good returns from the measures aimed at transforming the sub-sector into a lucrative investment.

“Our strategic interventions have led to a marked increase in value-addition initiatives. This will ensure farmers get good returns for their investments,” said President Ruto.

To boost the production of sunflowers, some 70 tonnes of seeds were purchased in 2023, with 40 tonnes being distributed to farmers while an additional 40 tonnes of seed were allocated to the Agricultural Development Corporation for seed multiplication.

The government, through the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA), has procured and distributed 500 metric tonnes of seeds worth Sh241 million to farmers in 24 counties.

He disclosed that Sh414 million has been budgeted for the 2024/2025 financial year to boost sunflower production under the National Edibles Oils Promotion Project.

Inside Ruto's bag of goodies for the sugar sector in Bungoma Madaraka Day,"President William Ruto dished out goodies during the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations in Western Kenya, promising to turn around the sugar sector, the backbone of the region's economy.

He revealed that his government had written off Sh110 billion in accumulated debt owed by sugar factories and pumped a further Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through state-owned mills.

The Head of State, who was speaking at Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi, Bungoma County, said the introduction of a new leasing scheme will ensure prompt payment of cane deliveries by farmers.

The scheme, he said, will speed up payment of salaries to factory workers and enable cane farmers to earn bonuses from investment in the crop.

“We are firmly committed to ensuring that the sugar industry returns maximum value to all actors in its value chains beginning with the cane grower. Bonuses to sugar cane farmers will earn bonuses every end of the year, like other crops,” said Dr Ruto.

The sugar sub-sector has remained the backbone of Western Kenya’s economy but is facing mismanagement issues, sparking outcry from cane farmers and workers who go for months without payment.

President Ruto pledged to revive the sector with a Sh2 billion investment into sugarcane development through State-owned mills after the completion of the leasing process.

First tranche

The National Treasury, he said, is to release the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development.

“As part of my commitment to invest Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through State-owned mills, after leasing is completed, I am proud to announce that the government has approved the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development, and the National Treasury shall shortly release these funds,” said President Ruto.

Leaders and farmers from sugar belt regions have criticised the planned privatisation of State-Owned mills, with some of them moving to court to halt the process.

Ruto said his administration was developing a farmers’ and agripreneurs database to improve access and utilisation of information in the agriculture sector to enable farmers to access low-cost farm input and ready market for their produce.

He disclosed that 6.4 million registered farmers captured in the database have accessed subsidised fertiliser from the Fertiliser Subsidy Programme.

"Gachagua: We apologise to Uhuru, never again will we vilify our king","Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said he and Mt Kenya were misled into denigrating their ""king"" - former President Uhuru Kenyatta - adding that the ""mistake should never happen again"".

Last weekend, Mr Gachagua accused ""some Rift Valley politicians close to the President"" of undermining him and the leadership of Mt Kenya.

Read: You are the cause of your problems, Kiunjuri tells DP Rigathi Gachagua

“Come rain come sunshine, we will never again vilify our king. We came here and vilified Uhuru Kenyatta. I repented after that. Did I not repent? Did you forgive me? We will never again vilify the king of the Kikuyu community. Let us teach our youth never again to be used by anyone to vilify our king. Let us love each other so that we get our rightful share of the Kenyan cake,"" Mr Gachagua told a rally at Kimende, Kiambu County, on his way back from an engagement in Kinangop, Nyandarua County.

Mr Gachagua—who had led a lynch mob against Mr Kenyatta and former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta—has taken a reconciliatory tone with the Kenyatta family, and has sworn to unite with the former Head of State in the interest of the populous Mt Kenya.

Mr Kenyatta had backed opposition leader Raila Odinga in the August 2022 presidential election, and President Ruto, Mr Gachagua and their lieutenants had used this to show that as a betrayal of the community, with a series of insults.

Mt Kenya Haki Coalition

A meeting organised by pro-Kenyatta allies early this month endorsed the former president as the leader of a new Mt Kenya Haki Coalition that will “protect and champion the interests of the people of Mt Kenya.”

In the Nyandarua event, a faction of United Democratic Alliance (UDA) elected leaders demanded disciplinary measures against Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja, MP Ndindi Nyoro and other youthful politicians accused of disrespecting Mr Gachagua.

However, the DP yesterday avoided direct involvement in the controversy, instead emphasising the need for unity in the central region and loyalty to Dr Ruto.

Read: Stop fighting Ruto, Sakaja now tells DP Gachagua

“There is a deliberate effort to disunite the Gema community. The community betrayers are still within us, but they can't win. We know their agenda is to be used by the community enemies to finish us. I see darkness, I see people plotting against the community, (and) I can see young leaders hired to divide us. Let us remain united, let’s ignore the betrayers,” Mr Gachagua said, noting that betrayers within the community have historically been used to undermine unity.

Nyandarua Deputy Governor Mwangi Mathara echoed these sentiments, praising the DP’s efforts to unite Mt Kenya residents and warning against political attacks on him.

Kinangop MP Kwenya Thuku said it was a shame for Mt Kenya leaders to disrespect the DP.

“For unity and political discipline, we must respect the DP and the President. We do not want the creation of another Tangatanga, we don’t want to go that route. We ask the DP to convene a meeting of all Central Kenya leaders to discuss unity. The President’s silence on such attacks will be interpreted to mean that the President supports what [Nairobi Governor Johnson] Sakaja and others are doing. These attacks are against DP Rigathi only but the entire community,” he said.

Nandi Senator Kiprotich Cherargei urged those disrespecting the DP to cease, warning that UDA should take disciplinary action against those causing division. “No one will separate the President and his DP,” Mr Cherargei stated.

Disrespect towards him

Kajiado North MP Onesmus Ngogoyo defended Gachagua, stressing that disrespect towards him was unacceptable.

“The DP is a symbol of national unity and must be respected. He was elected the same way the President was elected,” MP Ngogoyo said while his Kajiado South counterpart Samuel Parashina linked disrespect to Gachagua with disrespect to Central Kenya and Maasai communities. He praised the DP’s efforts in fighting alcohol consumption and supported the principle of one man, one vote, one shilling.

Naivasha MP Jane Kihara drew a comparison with Rift Valley’s political culture, where attacking leaders is not tolerated. “We respect and have accepted the DP as our leader. It’s a shame for the Central community to attack their leaders,” Ms Kihara said.

Meanwhile, a political divide has emerged in Rift Valley over the storm kicked up by DP Gachagua’s bare-knuckles attacks on Members of Parliament from the region perceived to be fuelling a falling-out in the UDA.

Youthful MPs are unrelenting in their attack against Mr Gachagua, while some of their senior colleagues and governors have backed the DP. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Emurrua Dikirr MP Johana Ng’eno and Kesses MP Julius Ruto have defended the DP, saying he ought to be respected.

Why WHO wants young people to lead anti-tobacco campaigns,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) wants young people recruited into anti-tobacco campaigns to stop children and the youth from being lured into smoking.

The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) says the young anti-tobacco crusaders will be instrumental in pushing governments to stop predatory tobacco marketing tactics.

Targeting young people is intended to help reduce the growing number of youths who become addicted to cigarettes.

“On World No Tobacco Day, governments are called on to do everything possible to protect current and future generations from the harms of tobacco by implementing the evidence-based measures in the WHO FCTC,” said Andrew Black, team lead at the WHO FCTC secretariat.

According to medical research, there has been a rise in teenage smoking in the past 10 years, even as the number of older smokers has been falling.WHO, in a statement released Friday to mark World No Tobacco Day, said the tobacco industry has long targeted the youth, hoping to create a new wave of “addiction and never-ending profits.”

The Secretariat of the WHO FCTC is supporting WHO’s ""Stop the Lies"" campaign, which seeks to protect young people from being recruited into smoking through means believed to be predatory marketing and promotion of tobacco products.

Very few take up the habit of smoking as adults.

Tobacco companies, however, deny the accusation that they have deliberately targeted young people with tobacco advertising.

“BAT has strict guidelines to prevent sales to underage and research guidelines which mandate that market research is only conducted on adult nicotine consumers,” BAT Kenya said in a statement Friday.

Smokeless nicotine

The Kenyan unit of the UK multinational is calling for sustainable regulation of smokeless nicotine and tobacco products to achieve a smoke-free Kenya.

“To realise the public health potential offered by smokeless products, appropriate regulation is required to encourage adult smokers to switch and protect consumers from inauthentic products with stringent safety standards and prevent underage access and use,” said BAT Kenya.

“Smokeless alternatives to cigarettes, including vapour products and nicotine pouches, are key to supporting the Government’s public health agenda.”

This year’s anti-tobacco day focuses on the youth, with a campaign that provides a platform for young people to push governments to stop predatory tobacco marketing tactics.

“The tobacco industry does this to recruit new tobacco and nicotine users as customers, especially as it needs to replace “customers” who die from tobacco-related diseases,” said WHO.

Sibling behaviour also had a huge influence, with children being four times more likely to smoke if their brothers and sisters did.

The WHO FCTC is an international treaty that binds 183 countries and seeks to stop the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by children and adolescents worldwide.

Anti-Tobacco Day, also known as World No Tobacco Day, is observed as a WHO-led global initiative to raise awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use and to push for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption.

The day is observed to educate the public about the health risks associated with tobacco use, including smoking and smokeless tobacco products.

Gikomba traders should leave vengeance after demolition of their shanties to God,"The hustler government wishes to inform all Kenyans that we have received complaints from a section of the general public asking why our bulldozers are only bringing down buildings in slum areas while those in posh estates living on riparian land are preparing to go to church tomorrow to praise the Lord.

Indeed, when we received this inquiry we had to check with our agents on the ground whether this issue was real, because never in our wildest dreams did we ever imagine that Kenyan hustlers would one day wake up and compare themselves with children of dynasty on anything under the sun.

The hustler government might be blamed for many things, but when it comes to giving hustlers the false sense of belief that they can be anything they want to be, no one can accuse us of reneging on our pre-election promise.

The last time a hustler who eats from the bottom of a city dustbin compared themselves with a government shareholder who drives on the wrong side of the road was during Jesus’ triumphant entry into Capernaum telling those who had gathered around him that blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the Kingdom of heaven.

While the hustler government understands that it is the teachings of the Bible that we used to milk votes from poor hustlers in Kenya in the 2022 elections, we wish to categorically state that we have since brought the Bible down just like you asked us to do, and any hustler still stuck at blackmailing us on how they helped us win elections should know that we were chosen by God.

The Bible says that whoever desires a permanent life of dignity must be ready to undergo a short period of painful trials and tribulations just like God tested Job who refused to abandon his faith for the greater good.

It, therefore, brings us immense disappointment when we see Kenyan hustlers, who are supposed to have read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, cursing the Kenya Kwanza government for putting them through a life of misery from the ongoing demolitions.

Affordable housing plan

The Bible says, in the Book of Mark 10:29-31, that “Mark my words, no one who sacrifices house, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, land – whatever – because of me and the Message will lose out. They’ll get it all back but multiplied many times - and then the bonus of eternal life.”

The hustler government wishes to ask all Kenyans who voted for us to return Kenya back to the body of Christ, whether they gave up on the gospel and went back to sin, because it is not possible that the same Bible they gave us to preach to nonbelievers who were competing with us is now an alien book to them.

We ask these questions sincerely; increasingly concerned by the latest weeping and gnashing of teeth by those who should be defending our government from opposition attacks knowing the journey we have travelled with them together from when they had nothing to now when at least they have structures that can be demolished.

Have the hustlers who voted for us forgotten that the same God who removed them from the streets when they were homeless and gave them shelter in slums is also the same God that can return them to the streets?

Why have you suddenly become ungrateful when God has sent the government to demolish your structures so that we can pay you money to go buy a better house as we wait for the mansions that Jesus went to build for us in heaven?

O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not see the affordable housing plan in the Kenya Kwanza manifesto?

When the Kenya Kwanza team went round the country in 2022 collecting views on how best you would want us to serve you when we assume office, many of you were categorical that they do not want to live in deplorable inhuman conditions along riparian land that were prone to being washed away by floods every rainy season.

Shareholding dreams

You told us that you also wanted to enjoy the life that comes with owning permanent homes in leafy suburbs where you are woken up by a choir of birds as you wait for a government vehicle to check into your drive way to drive you on the wrong side of the road to work every morning.

As you can bear witness, it has taken us less than two years to begin this process of actualizing your government shareholding dreams.

Last year, when we hired Benny Hinn to come help us pray for rain to visit us in Kenya, those who do not believe in God mocked us how we are clueless in running a country – they prophesized failure in our lives and quoted science which says that rain does not come from heaven.

We kept quiet as they laughed at us because just as God did miracles for us in the 2022 elections, so did He not only deliver the highest amount of rain the Kenya Meteorological Department has ever recorded in their recent history, but He also ensured that all hustlers who have ever prayed for an upgrade in their housing conditions had their homes swept away by floods to give the government a perfect opportunity to start the process of relocating them to the leafy suburbs.

Those hustlers who have taken us to court to stop the demolitions must understand that for you to enjoy an air-conditioned house in the leafy suburbs you must first leave your tin roof shack on the banks of Gikomba river and start living like a government shareholder who is ready to own a house in Runda in the name of the Lord.

Clinging to your shanty house – when the government is busy helping Jesus build for you affordable houses – will not only see you lose the privileges that come with an upgrade of your living condition, but will also demonstrate your commitment to abandon the hustler nation for a dry life in the opposition.

You cannot be a believer in the hustler government and take it to court; choose one struggle and let us know soon.

My Madaraka Day thoughts and a belated welcome to Somalia,"Happy Madaraka Day, dear Kenyans! You may remember my reminding you in detail, around this time of year in 2022, of the origins and significance of Madaraka (self-government), Uhuru (freedom, the event) and Jamhuri (republic status) in the process of our liberation from British colonialism.

I was nineteen, getting on for twenty, at the time of these momentous developments, and I remember the rapt joy with which the wananchi received these fruits of their blood, sweat and tears.

Tanganyika and Uganda had attained independence before Kenya, in 1961 and 1962 respectively. But their struggles could not be compared to the bitter and painful campaign of the Kenyan people, part of which was the armed Mau Mau campaign.

The new leaders, heroes on whom the people lavished their adoration and adulation, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, Ramogi Achieng’ Oneko, Paul Ngei, Kungu Karumba, Fred Kubai and Bildad Kaggia, were recently released detainees, from years of trumped-up charges and sheer extrajudicial restriction.

I might have told you somewhere that when I first learnt to read, at the age of eight in 1952, the most eye-catching stories in the nascent Ugandan press were of the Mau Mau struggle, the Emergency and the trial of Jomo Kenyatta and his colleagues at Kapenguria.

Seeing the same men taking over power more than ten years later, when I was a sixth form student of history and public affairs, was quite fascinating. But our interest was not theoretical. Most of Uganda’s manufactured goods came from Kenya, which is also our main route to the sea. Those guys were taking “madaraka” not only for Kenya but also for their neighbours.

This, indeed, brings me to the main thought I wish to share with you this Madaraka Day. “Madaraka”, as I pointed out to you, comes from the action word “kudiriki”, meaning, to be responsible for, to take charge of or to accept an obligation for a situation, an event or a community.

African unity and integration

I propose that Kenya’s Founding Parents, by calling their country’ self-rule “madaraka”, signalled their vision and mission for their country as a responsibility and an obligation to ensure true freedom, prosperity and well-being for everyone. Are we still living up to the ideals?

Another streak that ran strong through those early days of independence was the sentiment of Panafricanism or a continental identity as a fruit of our newly-won freedom. I told you of Mwalimu Nyerere’s tentative offer to delay Tanganyika’s independence if Kenya and Uganda were willing to join the “Trust Territory” (as the colonists called Tanganyika) in an East African Federation.

It did not happen exactly like that, but that was a pointer to the future Jumuiya (EAC). Even in the popular mind, the continental spirit was bubbling, with our musicians crooning about “shirikisho la Afrika” (African Union), and declaiming, “tabu zimeisha, Africa ni yetu” (the troubles are over, Africa is ours).

Did you know that the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the forerunner of today’s African Union, was launched in Addis Ababa on May 25, 1963, exactly a week before Kenya’s first Madaraka Day?

Kenya was, thus, literally born into African unity and integration, and her “madaraka” (responsibility) had, and still has, to transcend its borders. This is not only ideological but also geographical and historical.

Geographically, Kenya is inseparably linked to Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania, with many “cross border” populations.

Think, for example, of the Waswahili, the Wadigo, the Maasai, the Luo and Wakuria on the southern borders, the Baluhya, the Iteso and the Kalenjin on the western borders and the Borana and Somali on the northern and north-eastern borders.

Historically, the colonists had administered Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda as one “East African” unit. We Waswahili, as I call East Africans, knew the advantages of this unity.

That is why the Jumuiya (East African Community) was born, died and, like the famous Son of Man, rose again, and is expanding phenomenally, stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.

Peace in Somalia

Kenya, being at the heart of this wonderful experiment in practical African unity, has to take primary and central responsibility (“madaraka”) in its survival, improvement and smooth operation.

Indeed, Kenyan leaders have done impressively well in this respect, despite the Kenyan people’s recent tendency to be overly inward looking.

Kenya’s recent initiative of “visaless” movement across its territory is an example of taking continental responsibility. Her part in the delicate negotiations of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that led to South Sudan’s independence is another feather in her cap of regional responsibility.

Similarly, Kenya’s role in the search for peace and sane governance in Somalia, at unforgettable national risk and cost, will remain written in golden letters in the history of the region.

Indeed, I think one can say without fear of contradiction that South Sudan’s and Somalia’s joining of the East African Community is primarily due to the crucial role that Kenya has played in orienting those countries towards peace and stability.

I did not welcome Somalia or South Sudan to the Jumuiya with my characteristic effusiveness. This maybe because I already took their joining as a fait accompli. These countries were already strongly in East Africa, and we were in them, mainly through Kenya.

I was in Juba in 2009, during the CPA, helping senior officers polish up their English before they proceeded to academic and professional courses, and there was never a day there when I felt that I was out of East Africa.

Comparably, when my ex-KU student, Dr Adnan Mukhtar Barre, had earlier invited me to Garissa to address some high school audiences, I realised fully how inseparable Kenya and Somalia are.

This is even before we start talking of the many well-established Kenyan Somali communities in nearly all the urban centres of East Africa.

I am yet to visit Mogadishu, but I am sure I would receive the same hospitality as I get in some vintage Eastern Nairobi estates.

Meanwhile, tudirikiane, tafadhali (let us be responsible for one another, please). That is true madaraka.

"Biden details Gaza truce proposal, Hamas responds positively","WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM, May 31 - US President Joe Biden on Friday laid out what he described as a three-phase Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of Israeli hostages, saying ""it's time for this war to end"" and winning a positive initial reaction from Hamas.

The first phase involves a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from ""all populated areas"" of Gaza, some hostages - including the elderly and women - would be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Palestinian civilians could return to their homes in Gaza and 600 trucks a day would bring humanitarian aid into the devastated enclave.

In this phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last ""as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments."" If negotiations took more than six weeks, the temporary ceasefire would extend while they continued.

In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin.

The third phase would include a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the ""final remains"" of hostages to their families.

""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is under election-year pressure to stop the Gaza conflict, now in its eighth month.

Hamas, which Biden said received the proposal from Qatar, released a statement reacting positively.

Hamas said it was ready to engage ""positively and in a constructive manner"" with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces, the reconstruction of Gaza, a return of those displaced, and a ""genuine"" prisoner swap deal if Israel ""clearly announces commitment to such deal"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had authorized his negotiating team to present the deal, ""while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our hostages and the destruction of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities.""

Separately, the Israeli military said its forces have ended operations in north Gaza's Jabalia area after days of intense fighting while probing further into Rafah in south Gaza to target what they say is the last major Hamas redoubt.

The conflict began on Oct. 7 when gunmen led by the Islamist Palestinian group stormed into southern Israel on motorcycles, paragliders and four-wheel drive vehicles, killing 1200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel then invaded the Gaza Strip in what Netanyahu has called an effort to destroy Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that seized control of the area from the Fatah Palestinian faction in a violent struggle in 2007.

Talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and others to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly stalled, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress.

AN INDEFINITE WAR

In his speech, Biden called on the Israeli leadership to resist pressure from those in Israel who were pushing for the war to go on ""indefinitely,"" a group he said included some in the Israeli governing coalition.

""They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" he added.

He implored Israelis not to miss the chance for a ceasefire.

""As the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost,"" he said. ""We can't lose this moment.""

The Gaza war has put Biden in a political bind.

On the one hand, he has long been a staunch supporter of Israel and would like to ensure funding and support from the pro-Israel community in the United States in his Nov. 5 election rematch against Republican former President Donald Trump.

On the other, progressive elements of Biden's Democratic Party have grown increasingly angry at the president for the suffering the conflict has caused civilians in Gaza.

Palestinian health authorities estimate more than 36,280 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel attacked, and the United Nations says over a million people face ""catastrophic"" levels of hunger as famine takes hold in parts of the enclave.

Signalling a U.S. effort to build support for the proposal, the State Department said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Jordanian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts.

Speaking to the Turkish foreign minister, ""he emphasised that Hamas should accept the deal and that every country with a relationship with Hamas should press it to do so without delay,' the State Department said.

In a sign of support for Israel despite the partisan divide in the United States, leaders of the Democratic-led U.S. Senate and of the Republican-led House of Representatives on Friday invited Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress.

The week has been dominated by the fallout from an Israeli air strike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians.

""The Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war,"" Biden said on Friday. ""We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week.""

Bungoma gets a face lift as officials land for Madaraka Day,"Bungoma residents are in a carnival mood as the town warms up to host the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations to be held today at the Masinde Muliro Stadium.

Preparations for the big day have transformed Bungoma town, leaving residents to marvel at the benefits of hosting a national fete.

From Musikoma area, along the Mumias-Bungoma road, the mood is palpable with an improved road network and streetlights that have been erected along the key roads and the town centre.

The scope of road works includes upgrading urban roads to bitumen standard, drainage works and construction of walkways within the town.

The roads within the town have been garlanded with billboards bearing the images of President William Ruto, area Governor Kenneth Lusaka and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula.

Madaraka Day is a national holiday celebrated every June 1 of the year to commemorate when Kenya attained internal self-rule after being a British colony since 1920.

President Ruto will preside over the event that will take place at the newly revamped Masinde Muliro Stadium where more than 10,000 people are expected to attend.

Military officers and the National Youth Service (NYS) raced against time to complete the construction of the stadium.

The team was under the supervision of Interior Principal Secretary Raymond Omollo, who chairs the national holiday celebrations preparations committee.

This week, the team burnt the midnight oil upgrading roads leading to the venue and erecting a perimeter wall around the facility.

For the first time, Bungoma town will have three roundabouts at different points along the Mumias-Kanduyi road with water foundations.

Kenya Power and the State Department for Water are also on the site to ensure existing gaps are sealed and that there is a steady electricity and water connection.

The President has pitched camp in Bungoma for a three-day development tour before presiding over the national fete.

The Head of State landed in the county on May 30 at the newly constructed Matulo Airstrip loaded with a list of transformative initiatives for the region.

Ruto commissioned

On Thursday, the President opened Webuye West Technical and Vocational College at Machakha, before holding a meeting at the Bungoma State Lodge in the evening.

On Friday, Dr Ruto commissioned Mayanya-Sirisia Road and Kapkara dam in Sirisia Constituency. He also commissioned the Immigration office in Bungoma town for passport and other government documents issuance.

The President is operating from the newly revamped State Lodge.

Managers of major hotels in the town have announced full bookings.

Mr Caleb Barasa, the human resource and marketing manager at the Tourist Hotel, said the facility which boasts of two presidential suites, 15 executive rooms and more than 80 standard rooms was at 100 per cent booking.

“Madaraka Day has brought impact in terms of accommodation with an influx of clients seeking accommodation. Some of the clients are from the national government, foreign embassies, the political class and senior county officials,” said Mr Barasa.

“We have been forced to improve our amenities including the restaurants, swimming pool and the club to suit the class of clients checking in. We are also collaborating with the police to beef up security to ensure the safety of our clients,” he added.

Hunters Paradise

And at the Hunters Paradise, accommodation for its 32 rooms was fully booked by May 28.

Hunters Paradise front office manager Diana Apondi confirmed that the facility with one executive, four deluxe suites and 16 standard rooms was filled up.

“The Madaraka Day celebration has given us an eye that we are a potential venue for accommodations,” said Ms Apondi.

Governor Lusaka said the hosting of Madaraka Day celebrations had come with a lot of goodies for the residents of Bungoma that will live long in their hearts.

He said: “Bungoma will not be the same again. The economy of Bungoma will grow tremendously out of hosting Madaraka Day celebrations.”

The government allocated money for the construction of more than 600 kilometres of roads in the county and the refurbishment of Matulo Airstrip ahead of the national fete.

Some of the roads in Bungoma proposed for upgrade for the Madaraka Day celebrations this year are Matulo Airstrip access road, Makutano-River Khalaba (White Rose) Road and Bungoma- River Khalaba (C811) Road, which have been upgraded to bitumen standard.

Mr Lusaka said the construction of the roads under the Kenya National Highway Authority (Kenha), Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) and Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) was meant to open up the region and connect it with neighbouring counties.

Other infrastructure developments in the county include the reinstating of the damaged Malakisi bridge and approach roads, the routine maintenance and spot improvement of Kapsokwony-Kaptama-JCT (A1) and Kitale (B13) roads, Kimaeti-Lwakhakha (B141) road, Mungatsi–Kimaeti (B141) and (Turbo) Junction A1 (Shikhendu) (B123) roads.

Periodic maintenance

Under Kura, 28km of urban roads have been built in Bungoma, Kimilili and Webuye towns.

Kura is also upgrading 13.5km of roads in Bungoma under the annuity programme for Sh4.3 billion, including construction, routine and periodic maintenance.

“The primary intention of the infrastructure development is to support growth in the sectors of commerce, tourism, agriculture, rural production and extractive industries,” said Mr Lusaka during the opening of the Bungoma Food Security Exhibition at Kibabii University.

The county chief said his administration had collaborated with the national government to have all the necessary security arrangements and will continue working on gaps to ensure the safety of all residents and visitors.

Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa said the mood of the Madaraka Day celebration was being felt in Kakamega, as many visitors were spilling to the neighbouring county resulting in a boom in the hospitality sector.

“Kakamega and Bungoma share a lot in common and that is why we (in Kakamega) are feeling part of this celebration. I encourage visitors coming for the Madaraka Day celebrations to sample the different indigenous food and enjoy the hospitality of Kakamega,” he said.

How maize stockpiling in hope for attractive prices backfired,"Cereal farmers in the North Rift region who hoarded their maize worth millions of shillings hoping to get as much as Sh7,200 per 90-kilogramme bag, are staring at heavy losses as returns for the commodity plummet to Sh2,800 following influx of low cost grain that has destabilised market prices.

The poor millionaires who had stockpiled the staple for months in anticipation of better prices are now flocking the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depots, keen to accept the Sh,4,000 per a 90-kilogramme bag offered by the board as the prices nose-dive in the local market.

A 90-kilogramme bag of maize was going at Sh6,800 three months ago with fears that the prices were likely to fall following the arrival of low cost grain from East Africa Community (EAC) member states and the harvest of short season crops including beans and potatoes.

A spot check by the Nation in NCPB depots in the region revealed long ques as the distressed farmers rush to dispose of the produce to cushion them from further losses.

The Eldoret NCPB depot for instance is receiving between 5,000 to 8000 bags of maize daily with farmers expecting to cash in on better prices and prompt payment for the produce.

“We have been experiencing long ques of farmers willing to sell the produce to the board for the past two weeks due to better prices as compared to retail market and prompt payment-24 hours after delivery,” said Gilbert Rotich the NCPB North Rift regional manager.

The government plans to buy a million bags of maize at Sh4,000 per a 90 kilogramme bag through the NCPB for the National Strategic Food Reserve.

“We have so far purchased 592,000 of 50-kilogramme bags of maize but there are long ques of farmers willing to deliver the produce to our buying centres,” said Titus Maiyo, NCPB corporate affairs manager.

Most large scale farmers in the region are in a rush to sell their produce to avoid incurring losses due to the tumbling prices.

“The Sh4,000 per 90-kilogramme of maize is much better as compared to Sh3,000 offered by traders due to price instability caused by the market forces of supply and demand,” said James Songok from Kerita farm, Uasin Gishu County who has more than 1,000 bags of the produce in store.

Read: Food insecurity - Farmers stare at losses as acres of crop destroyed

Most of the large scale farmers were reluctant to deliver the produce to NCPB when it opened its doors late last year due to stringent conditions and anticipation the prices would hit above Sh7,200 per a 90 kilogramme bag.

“The government should allocate more funds to NCPB to mop up maize from farmers and cushion them from losses,” said Joel Maina from Moiben who has more than 500 bags of the grain.

The country realised 44 million bags of maize up from 41 million bags last season due to favorable climatic conditions and distribution of subsidised fertiliser among other factors.

President William Ruto’s administration has pledged to put in place measures that will ensure the country does not import maize by 2025.

Agriculture Principal Secretary Kiprono Ronoh while defending the Sh4,000 per bag offered by NCPB as favourable petitioned farmers with excess maize to sell the produce to the board.

“Farmers should take advantage of the government offer through NCPB to sell and store their produce,” appealed the PS in a past interview.

President Ruto late last year banned importation of wheat and maize produce to protect local market from cheaply imported grain that will destabilise prices.

He halted issuance of new permits to import the cereals noting that his administration will only rescind the decision only in the event the country experiences shortage.

“No permits will be issued to millers to import wheat or maize into the country. This is meant to protect our farmers against price fluctuation in the market,” explained Dr Ruto.

But agriculture and food experts said most millers and traders will be willing to import the commodity due to strengthening of Kenyan shilling against the dollar.

Read: Lessons from Africa’s largest producer of GMO maize

“The exchange rate of the shilling against the dollar is almost stabilising meaning that maize prices will be fair when it is imported into the country,” said John Korir, a trader dealing in import and export of agricultural commodities.

The shilling is exchanging at 130.4 against the dollar that is still hurting the local economy.Interviewed millers said the entry of maize from Tanzania and Uganda has contributed to the lowing the cost of the staple in the local market.

Tanzania is the major exporter of maize and rice to Kenya and other East and countries, including eastern DR Congo, Burundi and South Sudan.

“The maize prices are expected to plummet further due to harvest of short term crops-potatoes, beans among other alternative food crops to maize,” said Joshua Kosgei, an Eldoret based miller.

The millers want the government to harmonise standards for cess and levies across the counties to facilitate steady flow of maize to sustain operations and stabilise prices.

"With droughts ravaging cattle, Kajiado embraces fish farming","The net catches different sizes of tilapia. The fishermen identify the mature ones and place them in a container of clean cold water before releasing the rest back to the pond.

This is Imutaitin village in Kajiado Central sub-county.

Judith Kuntai, who practices fish pond farming, has also mastered the skill of removing scales and intestines of the tilapia before distributing to customers.

She keeps some for her household.

“When in school, I was told to transform society. I ventured into farming because of its economic significance,” the primary school deputy headteacher says.

The pond occupies a quarter-hectare, with two fences around it.

The project started by Kuntai in 2021 has survived the longest drought witnessed in Kajiado.

“Our borehole dried. It was very expensive to maintain the right volume of water in the pond at the time,” the mother of three says.

El Nino rains from November 2023 to May this year were a relief for Kuntai.

“I have not spent money on water from the time it began raining. Evaporation is less after temperatures fell. My maize and vegetables are also thriving,” she says.

The teacher encourages her community to embrace fish farming and rainwater harvesting. She belongs to three women groups.

“The heavy rains have boosted our fish production. Our dam is full of water that will be used during dry spells. We harvested rainwater in several tanks,” Kuntai says.

There is increased demand for protein as population grows. With global warming, scientists say fish pond farming will help fight hunger.

Kuntai appreciates the ripple effects of fish farming in dry Kajiado County.

“Many of our cows, goats and sheep die as we move them during droughts. There are also quarrels when animals move from one homestead to another. We’ve overcome these challenges with fish farming,” she says.

Isaac Samperu is another fish pond farmer in Matapato South ward. The father to three got into the venture after realising he could turn a reservoir he had been using into a pond.

“During drought, crop and animal production was tough as farmers competed for water. The fish pond and vegetables also needed water. The heavy rains came as a blessing,” he says.

“The circulation of water has improved too. The water that I pump into the farm from the pond contains nitrogen, phosphorus and other minerals important for my crops.”

Shortly after the fish are fed, they produce waste. The fish also do not eat all the feed given to them.

The remains stay in water, which is recycled through irrigation.

Samperu is happy to contribute to the war on hunger in Kajiado County.

“I get money from this enterprise and the fish is used as food by the community,” says the Multimedia University of Kenya alumnae who holds an Advanced Diploma in Management Information Systems.

Samperu’s tilapia pond is 20 by 10 metres and has more than 1,000 fingerlings. At least 200 adult fish are mature enough to be harvested.

He harvests tilapia two times a year and hopes to build another pond soon.

“My biggest problem is getting feed. Nairobi is very far but that is the only place I get good feed. A 25kg bag is Sh3800,” he says.

Japhet Kaadzo Tembo, an aquaculture expert, says the quality of feed affects the growth duration and size of fish.

“Fish should mature in there to four months after hatching. Because getting the right feed and protein is a challenge, the period in many farms extends to six to seven months.

“You must feed your fish well and create the right conditions for them to grow,” Tembo says.

Families displaced by the Boko Haram conflict in Nigeria have resorted to fish pond farming.

“Northeastern Nigeria is on the fringes of Sahara Desert where it rains for 90 days a year. The most important thing there is to have a reliable source of water in a secure location,” says Jasper Mwesigwa, head of the FAO Nigeria Food Security Analysis Unit.

Fashion footprint: How clothes are destroying planet – and the way forward,"Fashion, a multi-billion dollar industry that thrives on creativity and personal expression, casts a long shadow on the environment. While we enjoy the latest trends, the processes behind production and disposal contribute significantly to climate change.

Many popular fabrics, like synthetic polyester, are derived from fossil fuels. Their production requires vast amounts of energy, releasing harmful greenhouse gases. Additionally, textiles' dyeing and finishing processes often rely heavily on water and chemicals, leading to water pollution.

A major polluter, the fashion industry is responsible for an estimated eight to 10 per cent of global carbon emissions annually, according to a 2022 report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. That is more than international flights and maritime shipping combined.

Fast fashion, a business model based on churning trendy clothes at high volume and low prices, exacerbates these problems. Clothing is often cheaply made and quickly discarded, leading to mountains of textile waste, with truckloads of clothing ending up in landfills or being incinerated every other second.

The burden of this waste disposal, however, is not equally shared. Developed nations, often the largest producers of textile waste, frequently export their used clothing to developing countries in the global south. These countries, lacking the proper infrastructure and resources for responsible waste management, often dump clothes in landfills or burn them in open pits.

This practice pollutes the environment and poses significant health risks to local communities. A 2021 report by Greenpeace highlighted the issue of micro-plastics shed from synthetic garments polluting waterways and entering the food chain.

A recent investigation in Ghana, a major destination for used clothing from the West, exposed the devastating impact. Mountains of discarded clothing choke the environment, while local tailors struggle to compete with the influx of cheap, used garments.

The urgency for change within the fashion industry is undeniable. The path toward a more sustainable fashion future requires collaboration between consumers and the industry. Consumers can drive positive change by making informed choices, embracing mindful consumption habits and supporting ethical brands. Similarly, the fashion industry must prioritise sustainability throughout its supply chain, from sourcing materials to garment disposal.

Our responsibility as consumers

As consumers, we can drive positive change by making informed choices. Embracing quality over quantity is vital. Investing in well-made, timeless pieces ensures longevity. Opting for natural fabrics like organic cotton or linen, which have a lower environmental footprint than synthetic options, further supports sustainability. Shopping second-hand extends the life cycle of clothing and reduces demand for new garments. Additionally, learning proper washing and storage practices can significantly prolong the lifespan of our clothes. Supporting sustainable brands committed to ethical production and utilising recycled materials is also crucial.

The fashion industry's role

The industry itself needs to embrace a paradigm shift. Sustainable sourcing such as using recycled materials and organic fibers can significantly reduce the industry's environmental footprint. Adopting circular fashion models, where old garments are collected, recycled and turned into new clothes, minimises waste. Transparency in the supply chain is essential as consumers have the right to know where their clothes are made and under what conditions, enabling accountability for environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, the industry must invest in innovation, focusing on research and development to create more sustainable and eco-friendly materials and production processes.

Luckily, there are a growing number of sustainable alternatives available. With a shift in consumer choices and industry practices, we can transform the fashion industry into a force for good by using several known options.

Natural fibers like organic cotton, linen, hemp, or Tencel, derived from wood pulp offer a more sustainable alternative. These materials are generally grown with fewer pesticides and require less energy.

Recycled polyester, created from plastic bottles or discarded clothing, gives existing materials a second life and reduces reliance on virgin resources.

New sustainable fabrics are emerging such as those made from bamboo or algae. These options often require less water and land to cultivate and boast faster biodegradation rates.

"Waivers, VIP culture and impunity","The imperatives of law and order are indispensable components of every society's political sustainability.

This is because by definition, the idea of society itself arises whenever human existence ceases to be a solitary affair.

Society implies others, which is the foundation of the political, that interface of the private with the common, and the intersection of individual and public interests.

In other words, if two or more persons are to subsist without running the risk of violent mutual decimation, a modus vivendi dedicated to mitigating conflict, conducing individual felicity and facilitating collective efficiency, is absolutely unavoidable.

Howsoever articulated, the dos and don’ts of human coexistence are vital institutions that obligate all in order to propitiate all.

Thus, to be effective, society's institutions must draw their legitimacy from mandatory universal application in the sense that they bind all eligible persons without discrimination.

Irrational exemptions

Owing to the foregoing, the practice of maintaining irrational exemptions from compliance, explicit or otherwise, essentially constitutes direct sabotage of the political community, and a fundamental ingredient of pernicious impunity and intractable disorder.

An exemption is irrational when its beneficiary’s exceptional capabilities to meet or exceed the eligibility criteria for compliance are either ignored or perversely leveraged to create privilege, with the consequence that those who should find no trouble complying are granted the carte blanche not only to evade compliance, but often, to openly and publicly violate the rule in other ways.

The nation’s universal disgust upon learning that two banks — organisations reflexively associated with the phenomenon of ‘super-profits', which thrive regardless of ambient economic vicissitudes — had sought, and been granted, exemption from paying taxes due as a consequence of their merger, indicated our political community's visceral revulsion in the face of a spectacularly public instance of antisocial behaviour by the highly privileged.

Public outrage was further intensified by the fact that at material times, the ownership of the entities was linked to a serving top public official, who is the scion of a wealthy and privileged clan.

On a similar register in terms of potential to incite hearty public disapprobation is the incorrigibly delinquent penchant by VIPs, or senior elites in our public sector who, upon elevation acquire a sudden and intense appetite for impunity, to wantonly disregard the mores of harmonious coexistence, peace and order, and to flagrantly violate normal expectations of personal responsibility, public accountability and obedience to the rule of law.

Violate basic rules

What else accounts for the open indifference by our elites to such elementary norms as the Highway Code?

What accounts for the impunity with which they visibly, actively, loudly and publicly violate basic rules in the full view of fellow citizens, who are not patiently submitting to the same rules at immense cost and inconvenience, but are also horribly prejudiced by the reckless and inconsiderate rampages of their betters?

In every community, rules are invariably made by the elite, be they divinely mandated autocrats or sovereign representatives, in conjunction with their political associates and accomplices.

It may be assumed that these elites perceive some advantage in promulgating various edicts, and that they perceive themselves as agents acting within, not outside the political community, for whom the feasibility and desirability of compliance matters.

This is to say that, unlike the regimes of colonial and slave political economies — whose institutions were designed for the explicit purpose of expropriating and enslaving one segment of the political community for the benefit of another — it is reasonable to assume that when our elites make rules, they expect to be bound by them and intend to submit to them.

Representative democracy implies that our leaders shall make rules in our name, and therefore, shall make only those rules whose universal enforcement enhances our collective interests.

Elite delinquency

To make rules and subsequently devise arrangements for the most capable among us to disobey them, fundamentally contradicts the purpose of government.

First, elite delinquency is the most flagrant advertisement of a prevalent catastrophic failure of representation: the divergence between the needs of the people and the interests of their leaders underscores a fundamental conflict about the nature and purpose of the political relationship.

Secondly, and related to this, elite effort to evade compliance calls into question the fairness of the rules they make.

Far from enhancing prestige and eliciting admiration, VIP culture — the shock-and-awe exhibitions of material and behavioural signals of privilege, accessories of power and accoutrements of status, including the juvenile insistence on jumping queues or being driven on the wrong lane at peak traffic hours, entitlement to irregular facilitations to access rewards and benefits otherwise exclusively reserved for the deserving best and brightest, and other refractory conduct — severely undermine endeavours to develop coherent institutions and build a strong state.

More than anyone else, our elites should recognise the benefit of our institutions, and take the lead in personally complying, and ensuring that everyone else complies with them.

The fact that they see delinquency as prestigious is a horrifying moral tragedy which confirms our worst fears: state failure is an inside job.

Sh302bn in new taxes: Are budget cuts a mirage?,"When we appeared on a recent evening TV debate, the chair of the finance committee of the National Assembly indicated that he expects to raise Sh302 billion from the measures contained in the Finance Bill 2024.

Of that, Sh58 billion will come from the contentious motor vehicle circulation tax.

The two of us and our moderator could agree on only two things. It is not sufficient to discuss taxes in isolation.

We must keep in mind the expenditures that those taxes are supposed to finance. And, you cannot tax the country to prosperity.

The Finance Bill 2024 was been tabled at a time when the administration is taking up their intended expenditure cuts after a false start.

The budget policy statement released in February contained rapid increases of expenditure, taxes and debt.

There was immediate public backlash. Soon thereafter, the National Treasury issued a circular to state departments and corporations directing that they scale down their budget estimates by 30 per cent.

Proposed expenditures

It seems nothing this government says can be trusted. If they are cutting expenditures by 30 per cent, why does the administration need Sh302 billion from additional taxes?

Never an easy read, the budget books detailing the proposed expenditures for the national executive for the financial year starting this July 1, are available in the National Treasury website.

The 2010 Constitution expects public input throughout the public finance management cycle.

The Constitution gives the National Assembly immense power to determine the levels of expenditure, taxes and borrowing. Unfortunately, our elected representatives have all but surrendered this power to the Executive.

Most infamously, some MPs admitted not reading the Finance Bill 2023 as they passed it last year.

A quick glance at the budget books, also referred to as budget estimates or simply the printed estimates, shows that reports of budget cuts in the president’s, deputy presidents and prime cabinet secretary’s offices are greatly exaggerated.

While the proposed 2024/25 recurrent expenditure for State House drops by Sh591m from 8.53 billion, that in the Office of the President (OP) increases by Sh1.2 billion, compensating the State House drop twice over.

Leverage devolution

The development budget of State House increases by Sh249 million, while that of OP goes up by Sh155 million.

I have long argued that this economy needs a reset – at least three years of balanced budgets — in order to rejuvenate the production sector, and spur growth.

We also must move away from dogmatic application of rules of thumb such as tax to GDP ratio. Rather, we should base policy on a deep understanding of our economy.

Third, we should leverage devolution to reinforce growth. Let us examine each idea briefly.

Away from jargon of medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and fiscal consolidation, no nation can live beyond its means forever.

Here is the basis of the rule. To finance expenditure, you tax and borrow. When a government taxes excessively, it stifles the incentive to produce.

When it borrows excessively, it squeezes the production sector out of the credit market, constraining growth. Banks find it more profitable to lend to government, rather than to factories. The later end up closing while financial institutions report super profits.

Expenditure appetite

A constrained production sector cannot generate increased taxes. With unchecked expenditure appetite, the government borrows more, worsening the situation.

As many African countries have found out, debt distress is never too far once you are on this trajectory. What then, are you to do?

Every so often, reset the economy. Government should balance its budget, and get out of the credit market for two to three years. That allows lowering of domestic interest rates, making it possible for farmers and factories to afford credit.

In this trajectory, government will find that the resultant increased production yields even more taxes. This is precisely what President Kibaki did in 2003-5.

If government could live within its means at Sh300 billion shillings budget, and still increase civil service salaries and build roads, why not today, at Sh4.5 trillion?

The current administration has been chest-thumping about getting the tax to GDP ratio to 22 per cent. That is misguided.

Over the last decade, the GDP of the Republic has increased in large measure because of debt-financed infrastructure. It would have been nicer if the roads were built to last and not so easily overwhelmed by heavy rains.

National shame

But no matter. The infrastructure does not pay taxes. Rather the business that use it do. It is self-defeating then, to squeeze those very businesses out of production with high costs of credit and energy. Rules of thumb are a useful guide, but apply with care!

The national bureaucracy and successive executives have remained largely hostile to the second devolution in its 12 years of existence. The devolution in the independence constitution received similar treatment.

This phobia is irrational. The devolved units are not large enough to threaten the centre. And, devolution solved a major problem that threatened to break-up the Republic – marginalisation.

Many economic historians now believe that the 2007-8 rapture was in part driven by pent-up anger, the result of years of unequitable patterns of development.

The glaring disparities were to be resolved by taking resources and decision-making about their use, to the people in their respective counties. This strategy has the added advantage of spurring 47 centres of growth.

It is a national shame therefore, that we should be arguing over Sh400 billion for devolution.

As one of my favorite governors said recently, the only devolved function that the national government is not trying to take over, is rabies vaccination.

Nyadhi Festival set for at Carnivore grounds,"For Rhumba fans in Nairobi, next Saturday it will be an opportunity to team up with Johnny Junior and BV Band who will be the highlight during the inaugural Nyadhi Festival to be held at the Carnivore Restaurant in Nairobi.

According to the organisers of the event the show is set to also celebrate the 15th anniversary since the formation of Johnny Junior's BV Band. For fans of the band, it will be an opportunity to come together to celebrate music and culture dancing to the various compositions of the group.

Others expected at the show include Ohangla star Emma Jalamo, Nadia Mukami, Coster Ojwang, Nyasanje, Kidum, It’s Yaba and MC Pengle. Jalamo has popular tracks like Utanikumbuka and Amilo Nyar Nyakach. While Yaba has tracks like Jatelo and Sherehe. Nadia Mukami has songs like Mali Safi and Kai Wangu while Kidum is still doing well with tracks like Haturudi Nyuma and Mapenzi.

In the recent past, Junior and his group have been engaged in a campaign build-up to the festival during shows. Last Saturday they performed during the Wangawana Saturdays Show that was held at the Pyasa Lounge - Mihang’o in Utawala, Nairobi.

The group also regularly performs at other spots in and outside Nairobi. Junior formed the BV Band after leaving Musa Juma’s Limpopo International Band. Notably, the group featured rhumba beats blended with Luo ballads. Earlier, it was the legendary Ochieng Kabaselleh who was in the forefront of incorporating Lingala lyrics, Luo and rhumba beats. Johnny Junior has since excelled as one of the proponents of using rhumba beats in his recordings.

Some of Johnny's popular songs include Vinny, Mashabiki, Ösiepe, Nyaremo and Ämour Special. Entrance fees for the show will be Sh2,000 (regular), Sh5,000 ( VIP) and Sh10,000 ( VVIP). Tickets for the show are available through www.tikiti.co.ke

Explainer: What happens next in South Africa after ANC loses majority?,"For the first time in South Africa's democratic era, the African National Congress (ANC) will have to seek a coalition partner to govern with after it was on course to fall well short of a majority in the national election.

Here are scenarios of what could happen next in South Africa and which parties the ANC might partner with:

Will Ramaphosa get ousted?

With results in from over 60 per cent of polling stations, the ANC had just under 42 per cent of votes, by far its worst result since democratic elections began after the end of apartheid in 1994 and leaving it short of a majority in parliament.

Some political analysts say this could lead to party leader and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa having to step down.

Over the past four electoral cycles the ANC's share of the vote gradually dropped, but never by more than five percentage points from one election to the next.

If the vote share of 42 per cent or below is confirmed, the party could seek to oust Ramaphosa as its leader and nominate another high-profile politician such as Deputy President Paul Mashatile or Gwede Mantashe, currently in charge of the mines and energy ministry, to the National Assembly to elect as South African president.

A more probable scenario could see Ramaphosa carry on for a while to broker a coalition deal with another party in a bid to secure a parliamentary majority and then hand over to a successor, analysts say.

Asked on Friday whether Ramaphosa would have to resign after the dismal election result, ANC First Deputy Secretary-General Nomvula Mokonyane said: ""Nobody is going to resign.""

In any case, the ANC needs to move quickly as the constitution says the new National Assembly must convene within 14 days of the election results being declared, which is due to happen on Sunday, to elect a new president.

Who are the potential coalition partners?

Depending on the final numbers, the ANC may have no choice but to seek support from one of its larger rivals: the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, or the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).

The price of a deal with either of those would likely be significant policy concessions by the ANC, as well as the offer of some senior government positions for their partner.

Analysts say it is difficult to envisage a stable arrangement under this scenario, and South Africa could be facing a period of unprecedented government volatility.

Investors and the business community would prefer a deal with the DA, which has received 23 per cent of votes counted so far, and is seen as more market-friendly.

However, many analysts think the ideological divide between the ANC and the leading opposition party is so wide as to make such a deal difficult, if not impossible.

Led by Julius Malema, a former leader of the ANC's youth wing, the EFF may be a more natural fit for the ANC, but relations are tense between Malema and some ANC factions.

The EFF, on 9.5 per cent of the vote, said in April it would partner with the ANC if it got the powerful post of finance minister.

The ANC, which has not disclosed its thinking on any non-majority scenario, would be unlikely to agree to this unless it were hugely weakened.

Steven Friedman, an academic affiliated with the University of Johannesburg and Rhodes University, said it was hard to imagine the ANC and the EFF governing together for five years.

He cited their inability last year to agree on a constitutional change on land reform even though their positions on the issue are closely aligned.

A deal with the MK, currently emerging as the third biggest party with around 12 per cent, would also be difficult to digest for the ANC, which struggled to clean its reputation after the corruption scandals of the Zuma era.

""What we do know now is that the ANC is in a trilemma,"" said Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, a political analyst at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

""The ANC will have to decide whether it goes with its historical partners, the EFF and MK, or whether it takes an unprecedented step of reaching across the aisle of South African politics in a grand coalition with the DA.

""Anyone of those coalitions is politically unprecedented,"" he said. ""It remains to be seen to what extent that represents a true policy shift in South Africa.""

Less likely scenarios

If the ANC gets a last-minute boost to secure over 45 per cent of the vote, which looks out of reach at this stage, it could try to make a deal with small- or medium-sized parties to form a government.

Analysts have said the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which is strong in KwaZulu-Natal province and is polling at about 3% nationally, could be the ANC's first choice, but its support would be insufficient to secure a majority.

"Court upholds 20-year sentence for teacher who defiled, impregnated 14-year-old pupil","A former teacher at Tembo Primary School will serve a 20-year prison sentence for defiling a 14-year-old pupil after exhausting all legal avenues to regain his freedom.

David Langat was arrested on January 12, 2019, and charged with defilement in a Molo court after it was discovered the minor who was his pupil was pregnant.

The trial court found him guilty on August 13, 2020, and sentenced him to 20 years behind bars.

Langat's appeal against the conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court on July 7, 2021, for lack of merit.

The accused filed a miscellaneous application two years later on October 25, 2023, seeking a rehearing of his sentencing. He argued that his age and the time already served in prison were sufficient punishment and highlighted his rehabilitation through theological classes and counseling services.

Langat also emphasised his remorse and claimed his family and community were willing to accept him back.

“I have changed my behaviour, and have an amicable relationship with my fellow inmates. I am remorseful and regret my actions having undertaken a complete transformation,” Langat stated.

However, the state opposed his application, arguing that the sentence was lawful and emphasised the severity of his crime. The prosecution pointed out that Langat, old enough to be the victim's grandfather, abused his position of authority to defile the minor leading to her pregnancy repeatedly.

“The aggravating circumstances of the case are that the victim was a 14-year-old child in primary school and was defiled several times by the applicant as a teacher in her school Tembo Primary. That further the victim was pregnant during the trial,” stated the prosecution counsel.

Justice Samuel Mohochi in his ruling upheld the original sentence stating that the aggravating circumstances warranted a deterrent sentence and found no basis to alter the original judgment.

“This court is persuaded of the correctness, legality, or propriety of the sentence imposed on August 13, 2020, and finds no basis to disturb the same,” ruled Justice Mohochi.

Trump is a convicted felon. Now what?,"May 30 (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the first former US president to be convicted of a crime, will remain a free man while he awaits sentencing and could avoid a prison term entirely for falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.

Here is a look at what’s next for the Republican candidate for president against Democratic President Joe Biden in a Nov. 5 election.

What happens now?

The judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, must first approve the verdict and enter a final judgment, though this is typically a formality.

Criminal defendants in New York are typically sentenced within several weeks of conviction, but post-verdict legal wrangling can sometimes lead to months of delays. In the meantime, lawyers and prosecutors will recommend sentences and then argue over them at Trump’s sentencing hearing, where Merchan will make a decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely.

The maximum sentence for Trump’s crime of falsifying business records is 1-1/3 to four years in prison.

It is rare for people with no criminal history who are convicted only of falsification of business records to be sentenced to prison in New York. Punishments like fines or probation are more common.

Defendants convicted of falsifying business records who get sentenced to time behind bars typically serve a year or less, and even in those cases most were convicted of other crimes such as fraud or grand larceny - unlike Trump

If punished beyond a fine, Trump could be placed under home confinement or subject to a curfew rather than imprisoned.

As a former president, he has a lifetime Secret Service detail, and the logistics of keeping him safe behind bars could be complicated.

Trump could also be released on bail while appealing his conviction.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes. Trump is likely to make arguments that Merchan rejected ahead of trial, including that the indictment is legally flawed and politically motivated.

He is also likely to argue Merchan deprived him of a fair trial by making legal errors, including allowing salacious testimony by a porn star who said she had sex with Trump - testimony his lawyers said was gratuitous and aimed at inflaming the jury against him.

The defence is likely to argue that the charges themselves were legally improper. Falsifying business records on its own is a misdemeanor in New York, but is elevated to a felony when done to help commit or conceal another crime. In this case, Bragg's office said that other crime was a conspiracy to violate a state election law.

But Trump's lawyers have argued that state law does not apply to federal elections.

Could Trump still be president?

Yes. The US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years.

In theory, Trump could be sworn in from jail or prison on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2025, if he were to unseat Biden.

Explainer: Can Trump be president despite his criminal conviction?,"May 30 - Donald Trump’s criminal conviction for illegally covering up a hush money payment to a porn star will not prevent the Republican candidate from pursuing his campaign to retake the White House, even if he were sentenced to prison before the Nov. 5 election.

Read: Biden takes off gloves in Trump election battle

Here's why.

How can Trump be president despite the conviction?

The US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years.

Neither a criminal conviction nor a prison sentence would affect Trump's eligibility or his ability to become president. In theory, he could be sworn in from jail or prison if he were to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.

Jailhouse presidential campaigns are not unprecedented in U.S. history. Socialist Eugene Debs unsuccessfully ran for president from prison in the 1920 election, though unlike Trump he was not a serious contender.

Will Trump go to prison?

It is not yet known what sentence, if any, the judge will impose.

Trump could also be released on bail while appealing his conviction.

How could the guilty verdict affect the election?

While the hush money case is widely seen as the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions Trump faces, the guilty verdict could have implications for the election.

Opinion polls show a guilty verdict could cost him votes in an election that will potentially be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states.

Ghosts of our pasts: This is what it’s like to live in an age of trauma,"Our childhood shapes who we are. As young people reach adulthood, many are realising that their past experiences, especially childhood traumas, play a significant role in shaping their mental health and worldview.

A 2020 report by Centres for Disease Control and Prevention found that over 27 per cent of adolescents experienced at least one Adverse Childhood Experience(ACE) – a traumatic event such as abuse, neglect, or household dysfunction.

Studies suggest a higher prevalence of childhood trauma in the current generation compared to older ones. A 2020 study by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection reveals that one in two young adults in Kenya experienced violence as a child.

It is little wonder, therefore, that cases of drug and alcohol abuse, suicide and mental illness among young people are on the rise.

Winnie Machuka, 24I harbour memories from age 10 which have stained the canvas of my life. My childhood was not pleasant at all. I witnessed terrible things. My father and mother were constantly arguing and fighting. I cannot count the number of times we had to run to my grandmother’s place because my mother had been sent packing after a fight. It was chaotic.

While in Class Two, we were living in a single room and one evening, while my mother cooked ugali using a jiko, we heard my father approaching while singing. He was drunk. My mother told us to hide under the bed because when in that state, he was very violent.

That day my father caused chaos. He kicked the sufuria and it landed right next to my younger brother’s head. We were still under the bed as this happened so I struggled to pull him closer so that he wouldn’t get burnt. That memory is still etched in my head. I doubt I will ever forget it.

My parents eventually separated when I was in Class Four after an incident where some Sh20 that my dad wanted to use to buy cigarettes disappeared. Everyone in the house denied taking it and my father let out his anger on me. He beat me up for three hours, as if I was a stray dog. This was the last straw. My mother carried my brother and I and we left.

I never realised the full impact of these experiences until I was in my third year in university. A friend mentioned that I had very bad mood swings. She told me people avoided me because I would easily get angry.

Growing up in a household ridden with conflict, I would read books a lot. That was my way of coping. I was the quiet child who loved books. It reached a point I could not distinguish between my reality and fiction. I had read so much fiction that the stories became my reality.

I also battled memory loss, which I think arose from that toxic family environment. To date, I forget things quickly and my memory span is short. This affected my studies as nothing would stick in my brain, except the bad childhood experiences.

Even now, most of my relationships are strained. I don’t know how to say sorry when I am wrong. While dating, I tend to compare potential partners with my father. Whenever they shout at me, my brain immediately goes back to my childhood and I start expecting them to beat me. Most of my romantic relationships have ended by the fourth month as I am always very afraid that they will lead to physical abuse.

I recently discovered the man I called my father was not my biological dad. Maybe he did all those things since he wasn’t my real father. I am looking for my real father. Whenever I ask my mother why she didn’t get out of the abusive relationship earlier, she tells me that she loved him and had hoped he would change.

In campus, I was depressed, and constantly high on bhang. I smoked a lot of it, and it made the memory loss worse, but it helped at that time. It was my escape mechanism. When high on marijuana, it was easier for me to communicate. I eventually reduced my intake and now I don’t use it at all. I turned to journaling as a coping mechanism, and I have also undergone therapy.

Elizabeth Naimutiae, 33I had a difficult childhood. As a sixth born in a family of eight, you would expect me to be a neglected child, but there I was, the cause of conflict.

Of all my siblings, I was the only one who was keen on going to school, and this was making my parents quarrel. At the time I didn’t know that my father had already betrothed me according to the Maasai culture. My mother on the other hand was adamant that I needed to be given a chance to get an education.

My goal was to study and be someone in future, but my dad had other plans. I was frequently absent from school as I had to graze the cows. If I failed to do so, my father would beat my mother.

There was a time during one of their fights when he grabbed her by the throat and squeezed her so hard that she developed complications and was hospitalised for a week. That scene still replays in mind, and it hurts me to the core.

My father used to shout at me and sometimes beat me up. He used to make me suffer since he was set on marrying me off. He didn’t think school was a priority. I tried seeking help from the head teacher and the district officer, but it was all in vain. As a child I saw myself as worthless. I hated myself.

My father successfully married me off at 16. I dropped out at Form Two but even in Form One, my school attendance was very erratic. Luckily I was married to someone who was only six years older. Nevertheless, our union was really tumultuous. I persevered because in our culture we believe a father’s order carries with it a curse if not followed to the letter.

There was a time, while married, I even tried committing suicide. I felt so low and worthless. When I gave birth to my second child, I even lost breast milk. The child never suckled. In all the hospital visits, I was told to manage my stress levels.

I willed my brain to come to terms with everything that had happened so that I could move on with life, but it was not easy. I had to undergo therapy, and that somehow healed me.

My husband ended up changing for the better and now we are both Christians. We pray and fellowship in church together. I am now a counsellor and I believe healing is a process. Accept what is troubling you, then start letting go.

Mercyline Kao, 25At age six, my younger brother and I were left in the care of relatives while our mother went to Nairobi to look for work. Instead of the care we needed, we faced a lot of cruelty. One memory that stands out is when I fell from a tree and injured my ankle, then my auntie repeatedly hit that ankle to punish me. She was a devout churchgoer and a sister to my mother but she became our tormentor.

My brother and I lived in constant fear. One day, a male relative attacked my brother with a jembe and nearly split his head into two. We had to flee to a neighbour’s house. This was just one of the many incidents that left us physically and emotionally scarred.

Our ordeal didn’t end when we moved to another relative’s house. We only encountered different forms of abuse. At one point, I was sexually assaulted by my cousins. The trauma was overwhelming. It left me with deep feelings of worthlessness and a pervasive fear of men that would haunt me for years.

A glimmer of hope appeared when our mother secured a stable job in Nairobi and brought us to live with her. However, escaping the past was not easy. My trust in human beings was shattered, and I often felt isolated, haunted by the memories of my childhood. I hate relatives who mistreat children left in their care. Every time I hear on the news that someone has harmed to a child, I get enraged. However, I don’t blame my mother. She didn’t know the nightmare she was exposing us to by leaving us behind.

As a teenager, I used to cry a lot and at times even as a young adult, there are days I am overwhelmed by emotions when I recall the traumatic experiences we underwent. When it comes to relationships, my male friends think I am difficult to approach because I don’t welcome or tolerate their advances.

Healing has been a long and painful process. Therapy has been instrumental, but the scars remain.

Patrick Maina, 22My three siblings and I were brought up in a normal family setting. The person who married my mother, however, is not my biological father, and the two of them were always fighting. My dad frequently and openly beat up my mother. We would be having supper and then all of a sudden, someone gets slapped.

The man I called my father would hurl hurtful words at me and my elder brother, reminding us that we were not his children. He would tell us that we were draining his finances since he had to take care of our needs and if not for us, he would be wealthier.

These words would ring in my mind like a bell. They affected my concentration in school, yet I would be beaten to pulp for any slight dip in performance.

I have regrets for things that were not even my fault. I feel like my mother went through domestic violence because of my brother and I. I am an introvert not by nature. I forced myself to be one because my self-esteem was severely affected by my father’s hurtful and abusive words.

In high school, as a coping mechanism, I turned to alcohol and was later introduced to bhang. I was expelled due to drug abuse. I used to overdose then act mad and forget about things. Thankfully I finished secondary school. However, things became even worse in university. Due to increased freedom, I started injecting substances into my veins to calm the voices in my head.

I quit all that and now I prefer to pray and read articles about trauma management.

Boniface Waingo, 26I was born to parents whose relationship soured shortly after I was born. I think I was only a few months old when my mother decided to leave, taking me with her. Without any notice or explanation, my mother returned to her parents' home. I spent my childhood living with my maternal grandparents, and during that period, I constantly felt out of place. I really longed for my father.

By the time I reached Grade Three, I was taken back to his father's relatives because I used to cry too much while asking for him.

I didn’t realise I had made a terrible mistake. At my father’s place, life was hard. There I was, a nine-year-old with people I didn’t have any connection with and nobody to take care of me as my mother did.

I lived through that challenging life, but the longing for a complete family continued to haunt me. I remember crying every day, and asking God to give me both parents like my peers. I felt a huge void in my life.

I remember reaching out to my mother after Class Eight asking for her support to join a boarding high school, but she refused, saying that I had chosen my father’s side and I had to face the consequences. My mother’s side of the family was wealthier than my dad’s and I knew she could afford to take me to boarding school, so her response broke my heart.

I went to a day school more than a month after the reporting day since my father struggled to find fees.

Shifting between my parents' homes while young, and the lack of family support greatly affected my mental health. Even now, I often feel anxious and I struggle to understand my place in the world.

Some sports betting mayhem in May and the reincarnation of Safari,"Of course, as a hustler, I am into sports betting. And last Sunday, the last day of the EPL season, was a good payday.Three of the eight teams I had bet on let me down – Aston Villa, Brighton and Burnley, but five came through – Liverpool, Tottenham, Fulham, Newcastle and of course, Chelsea FC.

But the best bet I had made was on the last day of December, 2023, when Arsenal was at 40 points, five ahead of second-placed Man City, and their fans posted all those memes with pachyderms perched atop trees, with captions like ndovu ni kuu!

I had bet Sh1,500 that Man City would win the league by end of May, and on Sunday, they did, winning me four times my bet amount. Throw in the Sh5,000 from my quintet of Sunday winners, and I had Sh11,000 on my phone.

Monday morning found me at the DCI Desk of the Central Police Station in Nairobi, where I met a very efficient-sounding investigating officer called Kangethe who assured me, alongside his boss, that we would prosecute those Gitanga Close frauds.

“Watch out Odongo, Odhiambo and Onesmus,” I said to myself, “If you don’t refund my money. Mr Zhang and I are coming for you!”

Then, midweek, out of the blue skies, as I sat thinking of my next investment moves in case I did not make my end month deadline to partner in Safara Mascara, I get a call from a most unexpected person.

Desiree Simaloi, my ex-colleague and recent paramour, sent my pulse racing.

“My guy,” she said in a syrupy voice, “How have you been this last fortnight?”

“Pretty crappy actually, Simaloi,” I said truthfully, perhaps just longing for a touch of human sympathy. “I got taken to the cleaners by some city swindlers for a fake fertiliser procurement deal…”

“Pole sana,” Desiree said softly. Then her voice hardened. “Go after them hard! And if you do take them to court, I am good friends with a top criminal prosecutor.”

“Good friends?” I said.

“Okay,” I could hear the shrug in her voice. “I am actually married to him.”

“Oh Desiree,” I sighed. “Are you happy?”

Switching the subject, her tone now businesslike, Simaloi said, “That other day, I think I forgot my tablet on charge in your living room.”

“You did?” I said. “I did not see any tablet, Desiree…”

“Well, I did.”

“Let me check when I get to my place in the evening,” I said. “If it’s there, I will send a rider to bring it to your residence, if you drop me a PIN.”

“I am sure it’s there,” Simaloi said with finality. “I’ll pass by at 7pm to pick it up. And you better have a tasty supper ready, you Safara. I will be very hungry.”

I was home by half past 5pm, turning my place upside down for a tablet I had never seen. Was Desiree using a fake tablet as an excuse to come over?

As if by deux machina, Laura’s name lit up on my phone. We hadn’t spoken in two weeks.

“Hello?” I answered the phone, the caution obvious in my voice, as always with her. “How are you doing, Mama Neo?”

“Not your concern,” she snapped. “Are you aware wakina Neo walirudi shule last week, and I had to pay half the 50K fees?”

“I got conned by some wicked hustlers,” I started to say, “but I am in the process …”

“Staki stories zako, Baba Neo,” she snapped. “Mi ni 50K school fees I need.”

A light flashed in my head. “Laura, did you take a tablet from my place the other morning when you were here?”

A short silence, and then: “Neo took it. He now plays games on it. Kuna shida?”

“Yes!” I said, knowing my young son would never pick things without permission. “It belongs to my colleague, ex that is, and she needs it back.”

“Does she now?” Laura said. “It’s okay. Buy Neo a new one, and you can have it back …”

“Mama Neo,” I said, a desperate edge to my voice, “that tablet ain’t mine, and I don’t have money right now to buy the boy a new one…”

“Or to pay his fees, or for his food or rent or clothing,” Laura retorted. “Here’s the deal – pay half the fees, get him a new tab, and you can get back this one. Bye!”

And as she hung up, the doorbell rang, scaring me with its sharp shrill. Desiree Simaloi was here early!!

“Coming, coming,” I called out, a bit vexed, as the bell slashed my eardrums twice.

“Simaloi,” I said, as I threw the door open – and then I almost fainted.

For standing there in the hallway was Safari Safara, my first cousin, whom I had seen swept away by the floods at the beginning of May in a Mazda.

Either him, or the ghost of Safari, come for vengeance, for my abandonment of him to his watery fate, a few weeks ago.

What to do when you get a painful rejection letter,"The number of rejections a candidate encounters before receiving a job offer is unknown. But, it doesn’t matter how many times you've been turned down, a rejection still hurts. However, that doesn’t mean you should curl up on the floor and cry. You can transform a ""No"" into opportunity. Here is how.

Self-controlWhen your application is rejected, control your emotions. Do not vent in a professional email or conversation with potential employers. Don't take any actions that could jeopardise future opportunities. Be polite, thank the prospective employer for their time, and request feedback on what you could have done more effectively. Most of the time, you won't hear anything specific, but a hiring manager might offer advice that will help you stand out in your upcoming applications or interviews.

Redirect the negative energyAfter being rejected, anger, disappointment, grief and frustration often follow. Try to channel these feelings into something positive. You could pursue new opportunities, go to the gym, or take up a new hobby.

Take note of what happenedTo ease the sting, do some self-analysis. Reread your resume and cover letter and find ways of making them more appropriate for the position. If there was an interview, take note of ways to improve. You may have appeared stiff and uncertain of yourself because of the tension from a hurried and busy morning, or you were taken aback by a question.

Consider what would make each day wonderfulA fantastic offer from your ideal employer would undoubtedly be on the list, but consider additional opportunities, both large and small, that could enable you to incorporate happiness and pleasant interactions into each day. Choose an action to take at the beginning of each day and follow through with it, especially during the stressful interview periods. You could meet friends for happy hour after work, go to the gym, cook a beautiful supper or catch up on a TV show. This can help relieve stress.

Accept and move onSuccessful candidates take time to reflect on their momentary setback and pick lessons from it. They also take note of the pleasant experiences in their daily lives.

This doesn’t mean you become unrealistically happy. We are inclined to make comparisons between ourselves and our role models. As we do that, we tend to forget that they may have formerly faced rejection. When successful people reflect on their paths, they often view rejections and failure as crucial and indispensable stepping stones on their path to success.

Nyamira governor: Why we visited Ruto at State House,"Our visit to State House, Nairobi was not motivated by personal political interests but the good of the county, Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo says.

The county boss says their mission to the House on the Hill was to engage President William Ruto on matters of development for the benefit of the region and its people.

This came after pictures and updates regarding the visit surfaced online eliciting mixed reactions.

While some residents backed the move as a positive towards uniting the country, others wondered why some elected leaders in Nyamira were excluded from the trip.

""We went to see the President with a development agenda for our county,"" Mr Nyaribo told journalists.

He said the delegation asked President Ruto to consider reviving a number of stalled projects in the county and also initiate fresh ones.

""We have several roads including the one that connects Kemera to Kegati that are yet to be completed,"" Mr Nyaribo said.

Other stalled road projects are in North Mugirango, West Mugirango and Borabu constituencies.

""We told the President that there was an urgent need to tarmac Chabera- Nyamaiya Road through Nyamusi,"" he said.

The major road will connect and open up the lower parts of both the North Mugirango and West Mugirango constituencies.

The governor was accompanied to the State House by MPs Stephen Mogaka (West Mugirango), Clive Gisairo (Kitutu Masaba) and Patrick Osero (Borabu).

Mr Nyaribo said that, together, they asked the President to ensure that funding for the Sironga Industrial Park and Esanige Stadium is done on time.

The industrial park, if completed, will create hundreds of jobs for locals.

Mr Nyaribo said the park will not only promote local talent but also boost sports and tourism as well as revenue for the county.

North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko and Nyamira County Senator Okong'o O'Mogeni missed the State House visit.

However, Mr Nyaribo clarified that some of the political leaders who missed the meeting were away on official duty. He singled out county MP Jerusha Momanyi and ODM nominated MP Irene Mayaka.

Nation.Africa has since established that Ms Mayaka is in South Africa as an election observer.

Speaking separately, Kitutu Masaba MP Clive Gisairo assured his constituents that President Ruto will make good his promise to tarmac Motemomwamu- Manga Road.

The road, Mr Gisairo said, will open up the upper parts of the constituency.

""During the visit, I emphasised to the President the need to build the road. There and then, the President took his phone and called Transport CS Kipchumba Murkomen and asked what plans were in place regarding the road,"" the MP informed the residents.

He further claimed that instructions from the Head of State had trickled down to the roads engineer in Nyamira County and that construction work would start soon.

Read: Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo now says his impeachment was politically instigated

The road will enhance the status of Manga Escarpment, Manga Stadium, Manga Sub-county headquarters, schools, and hospitals, among other strategic facilities, he said.

Despite its huge potential as a historical site and a tourists attraction, Manga escarpment is yet to be fully exploited due to various reasons including impassable roads.

The post-State House visit backlash did not come to many as a surprise since Azimio la Umoja – One Kenya Coalition that Mr Nyaribo and his colleagues belong to is on record for condemning and punishing its members who visit the President.

Mr Nyaribo was elected on a United Progressive Alliance (UPA) - and Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya coalition affiliate party.

Last week, Azimio was forced to come to the defence of the National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi and Homa Bay County Governor Gladys Wanga, through a press statement, for accompanying the Head of State to America.

The coalition said the presence of the two leaders in President Ruto's retinue was approved by Azimio boss Raila Odinga.

Some eight ODM legislators who visited President Ruto at State House in 2023 faced disciplinary action by the party and endured the ‘traitor’ tag.

They are MPs Gideon Ochanda (Bondo), Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Mark Nyamita (Uriri), Paul Abuor (Rongo), Phelix Odiwuor (Lang’ata), Walter Owino (Awendo), Caroli Omondi (Suba) and Senator Tom Ojienda (Kisumu).

The ODM top leadership has been holding major rallies in the backyards of rebel MPs to bash them for “betraying” the opposition cause.

Western Tourism Circuit’s low numbers worry stakeholders,"There is concern over declining tourism and under-utilisation of attraction sites in the Western region.

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has reported a low turnout of visitors to its facilities in the Western Tourism Circuit, despite the huge potential.

This has forced stakeholders in the sector to plan for a regional tourism expo in Kitale in August, through which they hope to jump-start the sector.

KWS Western Regional Director Bakari Chongwa said the region’s potential is still untapped.

Read: KWS puts up 13 tourist camps for lease in cash drive

Speaking to Nation.africa, Mr Chongwa observed the need for stakeholders to focus on innovative strategies to market the region.

He said Western region counties are home to fascinating tourist sites that if well packaged, can be a game changer in the tourism sector.

“We have very great attractions including the unique white elephants in Mt Elgon National Park, the rare Sitatunga antelopes at Saiwa Swamp National Park and Kakamega Forest’s unique birds,” noted Mr Chongwa.

He said key stakeholders in the sector like hoteliers and travel agencies have a huge role to play in the marketing region.

Trans Nzoia Tourism Association chairperson Naomi Karani noted that the August expo will be a platform to identify the region's potential and challenges that have caused a disconnect between players in the sector.

Ms Karani said part of the concern is the declining investment in the sector.

She revealed that the stakeholders are working with the Lake Region Counties Tourism Association and Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) to identify key exhibitors who will showcase and package tourism for marketing.

KNCCI Trans Nzoia County chairman Titus Killong’ said the expo will be a milestone to improve the region’s tourism sector both locally and internationally.

“We want to use the expo to also package Trans-Nzoia as an agricultural hub. This is part of our strategy to maximise specific attractions in our region,” he added.

Vihiga woman stranded and ill in Saudi Arabia after dream job turns sour,"When Knight Ajenya left her home in Vihiga County in October 2023 for Saudi Arabia, she was in high spirits and full of expectations.

She was hoping to transform her family's fortunes and send her three children to good schools.

The 33-year-old Ajenya learnt about the job opportunity in Saudi Arabia from Mary Musembe, a neighbour who had returned to the village from Nairobi for a holiday in April last year.

Read: Dorothy Kweyu: A Sh123m demand and a mother’s cry to save her son from Saudi executioner in 10 days

Musembe would later introduce Ajenya to an agent in Nairobi, who was identified only as Ruth.

Ajenya and several other young women who shared the same aspirations would later be taken to Limuru by the said agent for a six-month training before heading out to their prospective employers in the Gulf.

Embarked on her journey

Ajenya's father, Nerbert Otiende, recalled how his daughter approached him for his final blessings before she embarked on her journey to the land of greener pastures.

“Having been a hawker on the streets of Kisumu for over 20 years, I saw my daughter’s proposal as a potential game changer. Life was so difficult for all of us, more so, after her marriage failed. It was such a daunting task taking care of the kids with my meagre earnings,” Mr Otiende explained.

Ajenya could call her father nearly every day during her first few weeks in Saudi Arabia and update him about the goings on.

“She would tell me about her life, how warm she was received by her employer's family and how friendly the family was,” Mr Otiende recalled.

However, after two months Ajenya’s dreams of making it hit headwinds. Suddenly, the frequent phone calls to her father disappeared. Mr Otiende was worried. He would later learn that his daughter had quit her job and went to live in a holding camp for unclear reasons.

""I tried to seek her explanation for what transpired in vain. Our communication had deteriorated so much since she no longer had a phone and was relying on well-wishers to talk to us,"" narrated Mr Otiende.

Ajenya would later stay in the camp for a few days while job hunting. It was during that period that she fell seriously ill, attracting the attention of a fellow Kenyan woman who was also putting up at the camp.

According to her father, her health condition worsened since she could not get immediate medical attention due to insufficient funds.

Nearby hospital

“Her friend took her to a nearby hospital where she was only given some paracetamol,” Mr Otiende said.

He says his daughter only survives on fluids because the infection in her throat cannot allow her to eat solid foods.

""Up to this moment we still don't know what she is ailing from since no medical examination has been conducted to determine the exact illness,"" said Mr Otiende.

The 58-year-old man said that he had tried several times to reach out to the agent responsible for his daughter’s placement, but she declined to help get his daughter back home.

“Whenever I call her all she says is that she cannot assist me since she is yet to benefit from my daughter’s job in the Gulf,” he recounted.

Ajenya is now under the care of a Kenyan friend who identified herself to Mr Otiende as Kagai.

“It is through this Kagai that we are able to receive updates about my child. She has been the one taking her to the hospital whenever her condition worsens. As a family we can’t even afford to raise money for her air ticket back home,"" he said.

Homa Bay man in court over theft of UDA election gadget,"A man has been charged in a Homa Bay court with assaulting a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) clerk and robbing him of an electronic gadget used by the party to conduct grassroots elections.

Mr Robert Ongaro was accused of using force to dispossess the clerk, identified as Godwin Okello, of the gadget during the first phase of the UDA's grassroots elections.

The court heard that the accused was part of a group of people who stormed a polling station last month and assaulted UDA election officials before stealing from the clerk.

Ongaro faced two charges, including robbery with violence.

Robbery with violence convicts face the death penalty.

On the first count, the court was told that on April 26, when the UDA was conducting its primary elections, Ongaro, together with others not present in court, robbed Mr Okello by force.

The court heard that they contravened Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code.

Stole (a) gadget

""You are charged that on April 26, 2024, at 2:30pm at Ongeti Primary School in Omoya in Kagan jointly with others not before court while armed with sticks you robbed from Godwin Okello of UDA and stole (a) gadget serial number 202404035 labelled Homa Bay/Rangwe/ Kochia/ Ongeti Primary School property of UDA and a mobile phone, property of Gordon Okello and used violence against the said person,"" read the charge sheet.

The suspect was also charged with creating a disturbance and acting in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace contrary to Section 95 (1) (b) of the Penal Code.

The charge sheet also accused Ongaro of assaulting the UDA returning officer.

He denied both charges when he appeared before Homa Bay Chief Magistrate Joy Wesonga.

The prosecution has called five witnesses in the case.

The case will be mentioned on June 11, 2024, while a hearing has been set for June 19, 2024.

"Man, girlfriend in custody after woman dies in suspected love triangle in Kisumu","A Kisumu court has granted police permission to remand for 14 days two suspects accused of killing a 22-year-old woman on Monday.

The detention will allow detectives at Kondele Police Station to complete investigations into the death of Vince Juma, who was allegedly pushed to her death from the second floor of a rented flat in Lolwe Estate, Kisumu.

The ruling followed a miscellaneous criminal application filed by Naboth Otieno Ondoro, an investigator attached to DCI Kondele Police Station.

He listed the two suspects, Cecil Wilson Omondi and Ashley Jemima Atieno, as first and second respondents respectively.

According to the officer, the two suspects, who are lovers, were arrested on May 28, 2024, after police discovered that they could be involved in the murder of Vince, which happened around 10pm on the material day.

""If the accused are detained at Kondele Police Station, they will assist us in establishing the cause of death of Vince Juma. The lives of the accused are also at risk and if they are released immediately, they could be harmed as members of the public are still agitated by their (alleged) actions,"" said Mr Ondoro.

Jeopardise the investigation

The officer also argued that the suspects posed a flight risk and that releasing them on bail would jeopardise the investigation.

Also read: Jilted lover to serve 30 years in jail for splashing acid in woman’s eyes

A post-mortem examination to determine the true cause of Vince's death is yet to be conducted and therefore investigators want more time to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident.

The case came before Winam Court Senior Principal Magistrate Robert Oanda, who ruled in favour of the detective.

""Upon reading the notice of motion application and hearing the applicant, I hereby order that the respondents be remanded at Kondele Police Station for a period of 14 days to allow DCI conclude investigations,"" said Mr Oanda.

Before her death, Vince allegedly confronted Mr Omondi, who is said to be her ex-boyfriend, at a local mini-mart.

According to a neighbour, Mr Omondi, 30, had gone to buy an ice cream when he met Vince, who also lives in the same area.

She insisted on accompanying Mr Omondi to his house, but he refused.

On reaching the entrance to his rented flat, Mr Omondi quickly locked the gate from the inside before the deceased could enter.

According to Mr Ojwang, Mr Omondi was in the house with his 20-year-old new girlfriend Ashley - a student at Riat Institute of Advanced Technology.

After a confrontation, there was a scream followed by a thud.

Mr Omondi reportedly called a taxi and rushed the injured woman to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.

Her body was later taken to the hospital's mortuary.

Preliminary investigations by police indicate that she sustained severe head injuries and may have died as a result of excessive bleeding.

Investigators are trying to establish whether the deceased was pushed from the second-floor balcony of the apartment or whether she jumped to her death.

The man helping girls in Homa Bay escape period poverty,"BY GEORGE ODIWUOR

As a learner in primary school, Derrick Geoffrey Onyango recalls seeing some of his female classmates missing lessons because of menstrual hygiene.

In Class Seven, most girls in her class had started their menstrual cycle, but not many could afford sanitary towels, which made them develop low self-esteem.

Geoffrey says some were also caught by surprise and did not understand what was happening to them.

He recalls a day when a teacher asked a girl in their class to answer a question.

""The girl answered the question correctly. She however failed to stand up when answering, and the teacher ordered her to go out as a form of punishment.

“But the girl was still hesitant to leave her seat. It turned out that she was on her menses and had soiled her clothes that day because she didn’t have sanitary towels,” Geoffrey narrates.

The girl did not want anyone to know what was happening to her. Her skirt had blood stains which she was trying to cover.“She finally stood up when the teacher, who did not know about her situation, insisted that she had to leave the classroom. Some of her classmates knew what was happening and came to her aid. They covered her with a sweater and escorted her out.”

Geoffrey says as the girl walked out, some of her peers, especially boys, laughed at her, oblivious to the challenge she was going through.

""I came to learn that the majority of girls who missed school on certain days did so because they could not afford to purchase sanitary towels. They chose to stay home to avoid embarrassment,"" he says.

After the experience, Geoffrey developed a passion for helping teenagers and young girls get sanitary towels.Together with a group of like minded young people, he started an organisation called YADE sanitary pads which offers cheaper sanitary towels to girls from vulnerable communities.

YADE trains adolescent girls on how to make reusable pads with the goal of ending period poverty, stigma and other taboos around menstrual hygiene.

Geoffrey, a law student at Kisii University, says he wants to provide alternative solutions to period poverty that affects girls in slums and rural areas.

Before establishing YADE, he did his research on the accessibility of sanitary towels by adolescents in rural areas, and the results were shocking.

He found out that some girls use pieces of cloth as sanitary towels.

""Others use mattresses. Some do not use anything,"" he says.

His study was backed by other findings from the Department of Health in Homa Bay county.

Because of this challenge, cases of truancy, absenteeism and dropping out among girls in Homa Bay have increased significantly.

Homa Bay is among the leading counties in teenage pregnancies, and most of the girls who fall victim come from poor families.

“Mostly, the teenage girls end up being lured by men who can buy them things like sanitary towels. These men often ask for sexual favours, and when the girl conceives, they disappear into thin air,"" he says.

Geoffrey is Yade’s programme coordinator, and he is assisted by the group's medical officer Kefa Aywa who is a nurse at St Paul's Mission Hospital, and Fauzia Mustafa who is a medical student. The group also works with volunteers who include teachers from schools whose students have benefited from the programme.

On May 17, the team went to Nyakango Mixed secondary school where more than 150 students, including boys, were taught how to make reusable sanitary towels.

At the school, 63 students have become pregnant between 2021 and now. 55 others contracted urinary tract infections between 2022 and this year, with some cases being caused by poor menstrual hygiene.

""*We have been using our money all along. We spend up to Sh 30,000 in one lesson,"" he says. The money is used to purchase the different materials used in making the towels.

The materials used include nylon, cotton and polyester. Other tools used in making the reusable sanitary towels include scissors, thread and sewing needle.

“During our lessons, learners start by drawing a sketch that resembles a cross on a piece of paper. Using the sketch, they cut out the materials and get the correct measurements. The pieces of waterproof material are joined using sewing thread, and two pieces of cotton are then put in between the layers.

“Once the materials are put together, an outer layer is added at the bottom, which has buttons or stickers that hold onto innerwear. We advise girls to have at least three pads which they can wash and use for several months,” Mustafa says.By March this year, the team had reached more than 1,000 students in 10 different schools in Homa Bay.

Aywa says use of materials such as mattresses and cloths during menses can lead to urinary tract infections because such materials are not sterile.

“Bacterial buildup may extend to the uterus and cause diseases such as pelvic inflammatory illnesses, and could also cause infertility,” Aywa says. [email protected]

Kenyan beach volleyball teams’ work cut out to qualify for Paris Olympics,"Kenya’s historic appearance in beach volleyball at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games remains a landmark moment.

Although the pair of Brackcides Agala and Gaudencia Makokha lost all their Pool “D” matches in Tokyo, qualifying for the quadrennial competition was a major achievement. Their journey to the Tokyo Olympics was as fulfilling as their debuts.

Not least because they upset favourites and hosts Morocco in the semifinals of the CAVB Continental Cup before beating Nigeria 2-1 in the final to punch the ticket to the Japanese capital.

Three weeks from now, the crème de la crème of African volleyball will converge on the coastal city of Tetouan in Morocco for the 2024 CAVB Continental Cup, which will double up as the qualifiers for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

And just like in the previous edition held in Agadir, Morocco 2021, the winners in both gender categories will be Africa’s sole representatives at the Paris Olympics. Kenya (women) and Morocco (men) represented Africa in the Tokyo 2020 edition, and they will head to Tetouan hoping to replicate their 2021 heroics.

Stiff competition

Kenya will once again face stiff competition from reigning African Games champions Doaa Elghobashy and Marwa Abdelhady of Egypt and Morocco’s Imane Yakki and Nora Darrhar. Mozambique’s Ana Paula Sinaportar and Vanessa Muianga would have been potential contenders in the women’s category, but they will skip the qualifiers due to the former’s school commitments.

In the men’s competition, Gambia, Egypt and Mozambique will look to challenge Morocco’s Mohamed Abicha and Zouheir El-Graoui for the sole ticket reserved for Africa. The pair will be gunning for back-to-back appearances at the Olympic Games on home soil.

While Morocco’s Abicha and El-Graoui have maintained their partnership since 2021, the same cannot be said of Kenya’s women’s team, partly because of a knee injury that Agala has since recovered from.

A lot has happened since their Olympic Games debut in Tokyo. Agala and Makokha no longer play together, with the latter having reunited with her old friend Naomi Too in the latest KVF beach volleyball stop held earlier this month, while the former has forged a formidable partnership with the seasoned Phoscah Kasisi.

Too’s return is a welcome boost to the national team, given her vast experience on the sand and impeccable backcourt defence. However, she presents a selection headache for head coach Salome Wanjala, who had paired Makokha with Yvonne Wavinya for the Zone Five qualifiers for the Continental Cup held in Mombasa last December.

Residential training

With Agala also returning from injury, Wanjala has to decide who will play alongside Makokha in Tetouan. It’s worrying that three weeks before this qualifier, the provisional squad is yet to be named, and the team is yet to report to camp for residential training!



It’s not lost on anyone that Egypt’s Doaa and Marwa are in rich form, having topped the Zone Five qualifiers last year before convincingly winning the African Games title in March in Accra, Ghana. Last weekend, they took part in the Beach Pro Tour Futures event in Battipaglia, Italy, under the watchful eye of their Italian coach, Nicolangelo Antonicelli.

Even though they lost all their Pool “B” matches to USA’s Madison Shields and Avery Poppinga and Italy’s Viktoria Orsi Toth and Valentina Cali, the Egyptians faced quality opponents and are a step ahead in terms of preparations.

Similarly, Morocco’s Yakki and Darrhar defeated Cubans Kailin Garrido and Mileidy Paret 2-1 (21-18,19-21,15-11) in the final of the second stop of the Morocco national tour held last weekend at the Martil beach in Tetouan. The thrilling final lasted almost an hour.

To underline their resolve to qualify for the Paris Olympics, Egypt and Morocco have scheduled two stops of their national tours in June to fine-tune their teams for the Continental Cup.

Historic performance

If the quality of preparations by Egypt and Morocco is anything to go by, then Kenya has their work cut out in the women’s competition. It will take another historic performance for Kenya to qualify this time round, and you have to feel sorry for the players and coaching staff who did their part in December by qualifying for the Continental Cup well ahead of time.

Three weeks is certainly not enough to prepare for a Championship of this magnitude, but I’m certain the girls will give their all in Tetouan. Whether that will be enough to qualify, remains to be seen, but Kenyans will be cheering them from home and praying endlessly for a miracle.

The odds don’t favour Kenya in the men’s competition either. Gambia has pitched camp in Qatar under FIVB coach Mounir Ghellaimi courtesy of the transformational FIVB Volleyball Empowerment Programme for almost a year.

Mozambique have been training hard in Sao Paulo under Brazilian coach Alexandre Pontel. The pair of Osvaldo Mungoi and Jose Mondlane has also featured in local circuits in Brazil as part of their preparations for the Paris Olympic qualifiers.

Egypt’s Atef Nassif and Youssef Ismail also featured in the qualification round of the Beach Pro Tour Futures event in Battipaglia, Italy, while Morocco’s Abicha and El Graoui are in good form, having won the first two stops of Morocco’s beach volleyball circuit back-to-back. Kenya men’s team coach Patrick Owino could take solace in the fact that he does not have a selection headache with Elphas Makuto, Jairus Kipkosgei, Brian Melly and Edward Kibet all expected to make the final squad.

However, just like Wanjala, he will bear the brunt of poor preparations and will most likely head to Tetouan hoping for a miracle.

Beres Hammond’s lyrics in his hit song ""Come Down Father"" might just come in handy for us all next month as we pray for the Paris Olympics miracle for our beach volleyballers. Let’s start practising:



Come down, Father, come down Come down, Father, come down Oh, I beg you, come down, Father, come down, yeah, yeah Come down, Father, beg you, come down

Stop helicopter gunships on Baringo bandits,"By Abdikadir Noor Fidow

Although one of the many campaign promises of President William Ruto was to crush the bandits operating from Baringo.

However, air strikes are not an option because they do not select the guilty from the innocent but rather destroy life and wealth indiscriminately. The use of air strikes within the borders of the state must be the last option, regardless of their engagements and strength.

Air strikes on civilian citizens are perceived as a sign of weakness of the government and will alienate the community that the targeted group lives with. This could destroy community lives and property, giving the bandits a fertile ground for recruitment to their ranks, causing the expansion of their criminal ideology.

Historically, the governments that used air power on rebels have failed. The targeted rebels expanded, thriving on the sympathy by the people affected by the air strikes. To contain bandits in Baringo and elsewhere, the government should employ the strategy and the machinery used to eliminate Shifta in the eastern and northeastern provinces.

The administration of that time never used air strikes or excessive force but engaged the locational chiefs, assistant chiefs and village elders in the local communities and banditry became history within a few months.

Rising Daniel Mateiko aims to reach for the stars,"“You haven’t seen anything yet.”

That was the message from Daniel Mateiko upon returning from Eugene, United States of America where he won the Kenya’s national trails men’s 10,000m for the Paris Olympic Games on Saturday.

“I have a dream of breaking the barriers just like some of the top athletes I am training with. I also want to feel like a world class athlete,” said Mateiko at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Monday night.

“I have dreams that by God’s grace, I want to fulfil sooner than later.”

After representing Kenya for the first time in 10,000m at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Mateiko noted it was a coincidence that it’s the same place he booked his Paris Olympics ticket.

“It was a dream come true having failed to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. I now have the opportunity and I thank God for it,” said the 25-year-old, who claimed the automatic places in the team for the Paris Olympics with his training mate Nicholas Kimeli, the 2022 Diamond League 5,000m winner.

Mateiko, who is a member of the NN Running Team, said that failing to qualify for the delayed Tokyo Summer Games that were held in 2021 inspired him to work harder and dream big.

Challenges

“At times life teaches you to treat obstacles as challenges to grow…I took it as a ladder to climb to the great heights and here I am going to the Olympics,” said Mateiko, adding that what changed in his training to finally make it was gaining self-belief and confidence. “You can train well but without that you can easily lose.”

NN Running Team also has the likes of the Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge, three-time world half marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor and Olympic and world 1,500m champion Faith Kipyegon.

Mateiko noted that training in the midst of such great athletes has greatly improved his game in terms of tactics and resilience.

“There is nowhere else really you can source out for athletics ' knowledge if not from this group. Of course there are always ups-and-downs but one has to stay focused,” said Mateiko.

Mateiko, who is handled by Patrick Sang said he is hoping for a good collaboration with Kimeli and any other athlete that will be selected to join them.

“We have what it takes to win in Paris. All we need is self-belief, confidence and good tactics. The 2022 world event in Eugene was a good initiation,” said Mateiko.

The National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) president Paul Tergat, who was in Eugene to witness the trials said Kenya has a strong team that can recapture the title they won for the first and last time at the 1968 Mexico Games through the late Naftali Temu.

“We have a great future in Mateiko and Kimeli,” said Tergat, 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Olympics 10,000m silver medallist.

Mateiko was inspired into athletics by his elder sister Valentine, the 2014 world under-20 3,000m bronze medallist.

It’s until Mateiko cleared Form Four in 2016 Moi Boys Kaptama, Mount Elgon that Valentine invited Mateiko to Kaptagat for training where he rented a house for him.

Valentine has established herself as an elite road runner, finishing fourth at the Paris Marathon in April, her last appearance. She was placed second at the Copenhagen Marathon and third at the Istanbul Marathon last year.

Mateiko paced at the London Marathon and Chicago Marathon last year where the late Kelvin Kiptum won in a course record (2:01:25) and world record (2:00:35) respectively.

Eradicate stigma on menstrual hygiene,"Menstrual Hygiene Day was marked to celebrate the importance of menstrual health and break the stigma surrounding menstruation.

It was a day set aside for the society to remember the challenges that women go through as they navigate through the hardships that emanate as a result of menstruation.

Let's ensure every woman and girl has access to the education, products, and facilities they need for safe and dignified menstrual hygiene. Together, we can create a world where menstruation is not a barrier but a natural part of life.

During this journey, women and girls need to be educated on the importance of maintaining a clean environment, both in the surroundings and personal lifestyle in a bid to eradicate some of the setbacks that may accrue as a result of an unhygienic menstrual cycle.

The government, in conjunction with other non-governmental organisations, need to be at the forefront to ensure that menstrual hygiene campaigns reach every woman.

Access to adequate sanitary towels and soaps is also vital even as we fight for this campaign. We've witnessed cases where women are forced to use tissue paper or cloth linen while on their periods due to financial constraints or lack of adequate support to get access to sanitary towels. This has mostly been witnessed in rural areas where the majority of families are given less attention in matters of access to adequate resources.

The government together with well-wishers and NGOs need to identify such areas and act swiftly. We can end the menstrual hygiene stigma. Let us channel our energy towards ensuring that our young women are stigma-free during this process of biological change.

Those found guilty of taking advantage of innocent women in exchange for sanitary towels need to be dealt with accordingly. Let's embrace and walk with women and girls in puberty and give them the necessary support they deserve. They deserve to be treated like any other person.

The return of Diani's nightlife,"For more than five years, residents and tourists in Diani, Kwale County, have been at risk of attacks due to rising cases of insecurity.

This situation was fueled by a lack of street lights along Diani Beach Road, the town's busiest road.

Diani, a resort town, has been attracting revellers from across the globe, who enjoy the world-class beaches during the day and party at popular joints in the area at night.

In 2023, Diani Beach was named “Africa’s Leading Beach Destination” for the 11th successive time by the World Travel Awards (WTA), stamping its bragging rights as a favourite global tourism destination.

Away from the pristine beaches, popular hangout joints include Full Moon Club, Manyatta Disco, Palmer Club and Tandoori International Club, all situated along Beach Road.

However, criminal gangs engaging in muggings along the streets threatened the town’s glory.

So bad was the situation that residents would start deserting streets when darkness fell, affecting businesses.

Tourists in the 24-hour economy would frequently report attacks and mugging along the road, losing their valuables as they walked.

A spot check by Nation.Africa revealed night activities have resumed after the new streetlights were installed by the Kwale County Government.

Entertainment industry

Tourism stakeholders and those in the entertainment industry have equally lauded the installation of street lights since March this year, saying they are banking on them to boost their businesses further.

Stephen Mure, an entertainment manager at Sisi Kwa Sisi Entertainment Movement, said they now have confidence in organising night events.

He said most of the time, weekday and weekend parties feature invitations from top artists and DJs.

""Our numbers were being affected due to insecurity because many people would not want to show up and leave late after the parties,"" said Mr Mure.

He added that even though the area is now in a low business season, sales and activities will rise further towards the end of July when the peak tourism season begins.

He further urged the county government to ensure all the stretch between Jacaranda Beach Hotel and Neptune Beach Hotel has enough security lights.

Shaban Omar, a resident of Diani, said he is now confident of moving at night without fear of being attacked.

""I can comfortably run my errands or do my shopping at night because there is enough light,"" he said.

Police patrols

Msambweni OCPD Francis Gachoki said the lights also helped police patrol the area.

He, however, said there have not been any reported cases after the street lights.

""We would receive many cases of people being mugged on the road. Due to the dark and forested area, many gangs would hide in the area targeting tourists at night,"" he said.

An earlier solar street lighting project, installed in 2013, was vandalised as thieves stole the panels, solar chargers and bulbs, leaving streets empty and dark.

This limited tourists' movement at night, especially those accessing cottages from entertainment joints. The road also hosts most beach resorts and boutique hotels.

According to the Kwale County CEC for Trade and Tourism Michael Mutua, the move to light the streets was to improve the tourism business, which had been affected by insecurity.

""Normally, tourists want to take a night walk after having dinner. Most of them are also getting attracted to Diani because of the vibrant nightlife,"" he said.

Mutua said the administration would ensure the new solar lights are not vandalised.

""We have so far done 50 poles for about two kilometres which was a hotspot for crime. The design was different because the battery, the solar and the bulb are now fixed together and can hardly be vandalised,"" Mutua said.

He added that the rest of the road will be lit with about 161 poles in phases in the coming financial year on a budget of Sh28 million.

Mutua added that apart from the main road, his department would pave beach access roads with cabro and amenities such as public washrooms.

""We have spoken to some property owners to ensure they also take responsibility and help reduce vandalism of public resources such as street lights,"" said Mutua.

While launching the lights in March, Kwale Governor Fatuma Achani stated that the solar lights will also be a game changer in the transport sector, where bodaboda and tuk-tuks will work round the clock.

‘Muguka’ ban shines spotlight on counties’ clash over resources,"The dispute between Embu and Mombasa counties over the sale and consumption of ‘muguka’ has highlighted growing conflict among devolved units over resources, bringing to light the challenges they face in balancing their own interests with national unity.

On Monday before President William Ruto faulted the ‘muguka’ ban by three coastal counties — Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta — as farmers and traders held protests in Ena, Embu County, more than 550 kilometres from Mombasa which was the first to announce the ban.

Kilifi and Taita-Taveta also joined the fray, fighting the cash crop by linking it to drug abuse.

Across the country, counties are embroiled in fights over resources and boundaries with some of the disagreements turning bloody.

Read: Raila's allies ask Ruto to visit conflict-hit Sondu

Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir ordered the closure of all ‘muguka’ outlets and directed county officials to enforce the ban with immediate effect, citing negative health effects on the youth.

However, Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire has dismissed the ban, saying ‘muguka’ is not a drug.

“The ‘muguka’ value chain is estimated to contribute approximately Sh22 billion annually to Embu County’s economy. It also contributes close to Sh1 million daily to the Mombasa County economy in transport levies. ‘Muguka’ farmers have invested heavily in the crop and stand to revenue and a source of their livelihoods,” she said.

Former Transition Authority chairperson Kinuthia wa Mwangi has attributed the counties’ fight over resources to the need to increase their own revenue kitties.

He also accuses some governors of overstepping their mandate.

“The Executive Order was a total abuse of constitutional processes as it is not based on any gazetted law as was the case by Mombasa County. It was fiat and discretionary in nature given that it contradicted a national policy, had no standing in law and can be challenged in court,” Mr Mwangi told Nation.Africa.

He explained that there are more than 16 boundary disputes between various counties that are all centred on resources.

Last year, Mombasa County’s plan to tax cargo at the Port of Mombasa ran into legal headwinds after Attorney-General Justin Muturi termed it illegal and unconstitutional.

In an advisory, Mr Muturi said the county had no mandate to impose a levy on goods imported into the country, arguing that the move could undermine national economic policies.

The AG said although the law grants the two levels of government power to impose taxes and charges, it also clearly spells out which distinct areas the two should work within.

Mr Mwangi said county nationalism should also be aligned within the confines of the law.

The former TA chairperson cited section 189 (a) of the Constitution which states, “The government at either level shall perform its functions, and exercise its powers, in a manner that respects the functional and institutional integrity of government at the other level and respects the constitutional status and institutions of government at the other level and, in the case of county government, within the county level.

Section 3 states; “In any dispute between governments, the governments shall make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute, including by means of procedures provided under national legislation.”

“There is a serious danger of derailing devolution from the way it was intended to work should the two levels collide in their functions,” Mr Mwangi said.

Recently, the Environment and Land Court confirmed conservatory orders allowing the County Government of Taita-Taveta to be the sole authority issuing business permits and levying county taxes in the contested Mackinnon Road and Mtito Andei towns.

The towns are contested by Kwale, Makueni and Taita-Taveta counties.

Justice Lucas Naikuni further directed that the Taita-Taveta County Government deposits all revenues it will collect into an interest-earning bank account opened jointly with Kwale and Makueni counties.

The judge also issued an order prohibiting Kwale and Makueni counties and their agents from collecting revenue in any way in Mackinnon and Mtito Andei towns, where their predecessors did not collect revenues before the establishment of county governments.

“I have already set out that the public interests will not be served if this court declines to grant conservatory orders sought, I will exercise this discretion judiciously and grant the petitioner the orders as prayed,” ruled Justice Naikuni.

The orders were issued pending the hearing and determination of a petition filed by Senator Okiya Omtatah relating to boundary disputes between Taita-Taveta, Kwale and Makueni counties.

Mr Omtatah seeks to compel Parliament (National Assembly and Senate) to appoint an independent commission to resolve the simmering boundary disputes between the three counties.

According to the case documents, the disputes have resulted in traders who used to pay taxes to the predecessor of Taita-Taveta County, before counties were established, being forced to pay taxes twice to two different counties. Mr Omtatah also wants the Executive arm of government to survey and erect visible beacons to clearly demarcate the boundaries of all counties with preference being given to Taita-Taveta, Kwale and Makueni counties.

He is seeking a declaration that forcing residents of Mtito Andei and Mackinnon Road towns to pay double taxes is a gross violation of the traders’ rights.

The case will be mentioned on July 2.

Meru and Isiolo have also been embroiled in a boundary tussle since 2013, which is yet to be resolved.

All guns blazing: How Kenya Police Bullets shot their way to the women's league title,"Two years ago when Football Kenya Federation reminded local clubs to comply with CAF Club Licensing Procedure which has been in place since 2017, most local clubs saw it as a step that would overburden the already cash-strapped entities.

But Kenya Police Football Club put in place measures to comply with the procedures, and the effort has paid dividends.

CAF Club Licensing Procedure has been in force since 2017 and is aimed at promoting and improving the quality and level of all aspects of football in Africa.

It covers sporting, infrastructure, administrative and personell, legal, and financial guidelines.

To illustrate the heavy price of non-compliance, CAF ordered FKF First Instance Body, the local entity in charge of club licensing in Kenya, to withdraw the licence it had issued to Gor Mahia last year when the 21-time Kenyan champions failed to settle debts owed to three of their former players within the set deadline.

That cost Gor Mahia a chance of competing in 2023/2024 Caf Champions League.

Among other things, CAF Licensing Procedure compels clubs participating in CAF competitions and African leagues to have a women’s team.

In June last year at the start of the 2023/2024 FKF-PL season, Police FC acquired three-time FKF Women Premier League champions Thika Queens, and rebranded the team “Kenya Police Bullets FC.”

Eleven months later, the team has won the 2023/2024 women’s league title under Beldine Odemba, the only female coach in the league.

Bullets secured the championship with a 6-2 victory over Zetech Sparks at Police Sacco Stadium in Nairobi on Saturday.

Coach Odemba reckons Bullets secured the title with a match to spare “because we played every match like a final.”

“We were expecting to emerge league champions , but the fact that we secured the title so early caught us off guard. The competition for the league title was intense, especially with just a single match left in the season. Our focus has now shifted to the upcoming Cecafa Championships in August. We want to start preparing early, and to bolster the squad ahead of the championship,” Odemba, who worked closely with a new civilian-dominated technical bench since the beginning of the season, said.

They dethroned their rivals three-time champions Vihiga Queens, who drew 0-0 with Nakuru City Queens at the ASK Grounds in Nakuru on Saturday.

In a thrilling turn of events, Bullets claimed the championship and qualified to represent Kenya in the fourth edition of Cecafa Women Club Championships that will be held in Ethiopia in August.

Vihiga won the inaugural Cecafa Women Club Championships in 2021 in Nairobi, and have competed in the tournament twice, most recently last year in Uganda, where they were eliminated 2-1 in the semi-finals by CBE of Ethiopia .

Bullets took a decissive step towards securing the league title with a 1-0 win against Vihiga Queens, thanks to Lydia Akoth’s penalty in the 7th minute on February 10 at Police Sacco Stadium.

That defeat was Vihiga’s first of the season, and allowed Bullets to take a three-point lead at the top of the table.

With a match to the end of the season, the law enforcers top the league standings with 46 points from 18 matches, achieving 14 wins and four draws without a single loss. Bullets have so far scored 51 goals and conceded 15.

The team turned their home ground into a fortress, winning all their home fixtures.

Vihiga are second on the log with 41 points from 18 matches, having won 12, drawn five, and lost one.

Bullets will face Bunyore Starlets at Mumboha Stadium in Vihiga County on June 25 in their final match of the season, after which they will be presented with the league trophy, medals, and a cheque of Sh1 million.

“Our experience throughout this journey has been incredible. We approached every match like a final, taking each game as it came. The men's teams and the entire Police FC community have displayed incredible support, and we thank them for standing by us throughout the season,” Odemba, who is also the Kenya women’s national football team coach, said.

In Thika Queens, Police FC acquired a good side which had won the FKF-WPL title thrice - in 2014/15 season, 2016/17 campaign, and in the 2020/21 season.

Thika Queens was sister team to Thika United that competed in the men’s top tier but got relegated in 2018 and is now defunct.

In the 2022/23 season, Thika Queens finished fifth with 35 points in the FKF-WPL under coach Benter Achieng, the sole female coach in the women’s league that season. This marked their worst finish since joining the FKF-WPL from Division One in 2009.

In June, Police FC announced a mutually beneficial agreement to assume full control of Thika Queens as their female team.

“This groundbreaking partnership marks an exciting chapter in the history of both clubs. Kenya Police FC, a renowned institution with a rich footballing heritage, and Thika Queens FC, a highly respected women’s football club, have come together to foster unity, inclusivity, and enhanced opportunities for players, staff, and fans alike, the statement read in part.

The primary objective of the partnership was to empower and promote women’s football in Kenya as Thika was at the forefront of women’s football, consistently delivering outstanding performances and nurturing young talent, some who have played for both junior and senior national women’s teams.

Strikers Mwanahalima Adam of Turkish side Hakkarigücü Spor and Esse Akida of PAOK in Greece started their careers at Thika Queens before going to Europe to play professional football.

Kenya Police Bullets FC now consists of 26 players and a technical bench of 10. The team recruited professional players, retained some, and released others, each player signing a five-year contract.

The retained players from the old outfit include defenders Juliet Ondibo (captain), Nelly Sawe, Grogina Mulati, strikers Chris Kach, Rebecca Okwaro, and goalkeeper Mishi Mbaru.

Mbaru has kept five clean sheets this season and is among the top local goalkeepers in the league alongside Sophy Akinyi of Vihiga Queens has 10 clean sheets.

The team’s defence, led by Ondibo, Quinter Owiti, Stella Oduor, and Sawe, has benen instrumental in their title run, giving strikers a hard time.

In midfield, Diana Wacera, Lydia Akoth, Lydia Waganda, and Mercy Njeri, who joined the team from relegated Gaspo Women, stood firm.

Strikers Okwaro, Puren Alukwe (formerly with Zetech), and Lucy Kwekwe (joined from Basco Othukkungal in India), scored crucial goals. Alukwe and Okwaro are also chasing the Golden Boot award, and winger Alukwe is second in the goal scorers' chart with 14 goals, one behind top scorer Tumaini Waliaula of Vihiga Queens. Okwaro is in third place with 13 goals.

“We are chasing the Golden Boot award, and we could bring it home as my strikers have all been scoring. But we are not going for anything individual; we are going for everything as a team,” said Odemba.

Every player at Kenya Police Bullets is paid a salary directly to her account by the club’s board of trustees.

The players are paid salary of Sh15,000 and a winning allowance of Sh2,500. No other club in the league pays as much.

Police FC, under the leadership of Senior Assistant Inspector General of Police (S/AIG) Munga Nyale who is also the club’s chairman, Superintendent with Kenya Police Chris Oguso who is also the Chief Executive Officer of Police FC, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees Dr Fred Akama have led both teams to success.

Police teams have been one of the biggest spenders in the league, and their investments have yielded positive results. Their teams have been formidable title contenders this season.

“On the day we formed this team, we were confident in our ability to win the league. We brought in a skilled coach whom we fully supported, allowing her to choose her technical staff and players without any interference.

""Despite interest from top clubs, we persuaded her to stay with us. Following her advice, we began paying the players, a decision we readily embraced.

""Our focus now shifts to Cecafa tournament, with all players equipped with necessary travel documents as we prepare to represent our country,"" Oguso told Nation Sport on Sunday.

“As we head to regional competitions, we have organized multiple sponsors who will partner with us for financial support as we represent our country next season. Women's football has become a powerhouse in Kenya and needs to be taken seriously. There are plans for exchange programmes with clubs from Tanzania for player exchanges, and friendly matches in future,” Dr Akama said.

Early this season, the contractor finished work on the brand new Police Sacco Stadium at the CID Training Center in South C, Nairobi.

The construction was funded by the Kenya Police Sacco, with sponsors Betika, Air 748 services, and DTB Bank also on board.

It was launched by President William Ruto on February 3. The stadium has relieved the club of the ned to hire match venues, and has generated revenue. Some of Police FC players have been recruited to the National Police Service, and there are similar plans for members of the women’s team.

Parliamentary committee pledges justice for murdered Agnes Wanjiru,"The unexplained death of Agnes Wanjiru and delayed compensation for the 2021 Lolldaiga wildfire dominated the first public hearings into the conduct of the British Army Training in Kenya (Batuk), which began on Tuesday.

The National Assembly's Defence, Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committee has embarked on a three-day exercise in Laikipia and Samburu counties, where locals have been invited to give their views on incidents of human rights abuses and alleged ethical breaches by British soldiers.

Committee chairman Nelson Koech led his team in gathering views from the affected communities where foreign troops conduct their military training.

The team will then produce a report that will feed into a review of the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) between Kenya and the UK, which is renewed every five years.

The family of Agnes Wanjiru, who was allegedly killed by a British soldier in 2012, accused the Kenyan authorities of not doing enough to help them get justice.

""For more than 10 years since my aunt was killed, not a single Kenyan government official has given us a firm assurance that the culprit, who was well known, will be prosecuted. Agnes' daughter, who is now almost a teenager, is traumatised because she already knows that her mother was killed by British soldiers,"" Esther Njoki, a niece of the late Agnes, told the committee at Nanyuki Social Hall.

Njoki urged the committee to take the issue seriously and remove all hurdles that have delayed the prosecution of the culprit to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

Mr Koech described the unsolved murder of Wanjiru as a huge problem that had contributed to delaying the signing of the DCA by a year after his committee had demanded that it be resolved first.

Unfortunate incident

""We take this issue very seriously and that is why we are here. It was an unfortunate incident and we will ensure that the culprit is prosecuted because murder is a very serious crime. That is why we have proposed a clause in the DCA that foreigners who commit crimes here will be prosecuted by a Kenyan court,"" said the chairman.

Laikipia East MP Mwangi Kiunjuri, who accompanied the Koech-led committee, said he would mobilise his colleagues in Parliament to come up with laws to ensure that foreigners who commit crimes in Kenya face the law locally.

Mr Kiunjuri accused the British government of discriminating against locals on compensation, noting that the owner of the Lolldaiga farm had been compensated but the victims of the fire were yet to receive their pay more than two years later.

More than 5,000 people living near Lolldaiga Ranch went to court to claim compensation for damage to their health and environment caused by toxic smoke from the March 2021 fire.

""We understand that both the ranch owner and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) have been compensated. Why is the community that suffered the adverse effects of the toxic smoke from the wildfire yet to receive their dues?"" asked Mr Kiunjuri.

The parliamentary committee also heard of alleged discrimination in employment opportunities at Batuk Nyatti Barracks in Nanyuki, while local traders and investors complained of dwindling business opportunities, claiming that suppliers were being sourced from outside the county.

Other issues of concern raised during the public hearings held at Jua Kali Centre and Nanyuki Town on Tuesday included unexploded ordnance on the training grounds and unfavourable employment procedures for casual labourers and other staff at Nanyuki Nyatti Barracks.

Mr Koech and his committee will visit Archers Post Township in Samburu County on Wednesday before heading to Doldol Town in Laikipia on Thursday for further public engagements.

Advise! I fear losing my older girlfriend,"I am in a relationship with a woman from my village. She completes her nursing course in a few months. I plan to marry her as soon as possible.

My worry is whether we are a good match. Will she wait for me since I have a year to complete high school? She has promised to care for me and help me with my college fees. She is older by three years.

Will this work? I love her so much, and, at times, I fear we might lose each other. Kindly advise.

Hi

Relationships are based on knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. You should know what it means to be in a relationship and a marriage.

What brings you together? Infatuation is great but it will not hold a relationship together. You must be able to answer, “Why do I feel attracted to her and feel she is the right one? Where is she headed in life?”

Remember that by the time she completes college, you will be finishing high school or starting college.

Marrying her while in college and she is working will not only be an unwise idea but is a decision that will stress your relationship.

For example, who will pay your college fees, housing, and care for your upkeep and a baby if this happens sooner than expected? I am worried whether you are attracted to each other for the right reasons.

Enduring relationships are based on clearly knowing each other’s dreams and aspirations.

As much as you love her, let some facts speak for themselves.

First, you are still in high school and have no job yet. Second, both of you will find marriage responsibilities difficult and stressful.

Third, your responsibilities as a married man will interfere with your future dreams.

And finally, since you are yet to qualify for marriage, I suggest you concentrate on your studies, for now.

Take the necessary precaution

Relationships are not only about knowledge but also understanding. Are you aware of the consequences of the choice you would like to make?

As I implied earlier, finances play a significant role in any relationship because they help a family meet their basic needs.

I can authoritatively state that the pressure to meet the bills has caused many relationships to break apart.

In some cases, poor choices can lead to violence. With violence comes the separation of the family. Her words of committing to support you are noble but can be far from reality.

I don’t doubt her ability, but caution that promises are wishes to be tested. Your fear of the future is valid.

At times, fears are good at helping us take the necessary precautions.

However, a guaranteed marriage is based on wisdom that seeks to evaluate and understand all things in light of the facts and realities of life.

Avoid being drawn to each as a result of temporal things or desires. As far as age is concerned, it may never be an issue so long as the two are of acceptable age and can handle what it takes to build a strong and tested marriage.

You should put off any marriage plans and pursue your career. If she marries someone else, move on. You are still young.

Focus on building a career

Your future depends on the choices you make now. Don’t sell your future for a marriage you are not ready for.

Recall that young people who have experienced sexual intimacy may get swept away by a romance that does not guarantee them the life they had hoped for.

Additionally, I am sure that you have parents taking care of you. Listen to them. The wisdom of the elderly corrects the mistakes we might make now and in the future.

Do not dispose of their wisdom and guidance just because they are not of your age.

Redefine your future based on wise goals to create a pleasurable and honourable life. Many have rushed and regretted their choices. As the proverb “Hurry hurry has no blessing” goes, there is no urgency here.

The future ahead is bright, based on the right choices.

Avoid making promises, and set each other free to get into a stable career. If both of you will be available, solidify your dating into marriage.

As you focus on building a career, establish clear boundaries. You will need to reaffirm your commitment to achieving your desired career goals.

Maturity demands that friends respect each other’s choices and commitments.

Relationships swing those involved from one emotional state to another. However, a lack of self-control undermines our sense of judgment and kills our future dreams. Self-control keeps us grounded to make informed and well-thought-through decisions.

Think thrice before falling into adultery,"In her track, How Could an Angel Break My Heart, Toni Braxton sings: “I heard he sang a lullaby. I heard he sang it from his heart. When I found out, I thought I would die. Because that lullaby was mine.”

There is nothing as painful in a marriage as finding out that your spouse has been unfaithful. It does not matter how much the cheater justifies this level of betrayal or sanitises it. It speaks of their character more than anything else they can ever do to their betrayed partner.

Next to domestic violence, adultery is a betrayal that wounds so deeply that your spouse’s worldview, perception, and beliefs are altered, because of you.

When adultery and abuse happen simultaneously, a person is left so wounded that they must dig into their supernatural strength to survive it.

Read: Stop listening to those negative marriage stories

“Adultery is a betrayal that hurts deeper than a knife wound.” *Loice says. “It causes trauma and momentary insanity.” Adultery brings to the fore abandonment concerns, it makes you feel faint, angry, and murderous, but mostly, breaks your heart and faith in humanity.

I know that sounds dramatic. But ask those who have lived through it.

“I felt broken. I felt…worthless, a lesser man.” *Andrew Majuma says when he discovered his wife of 12 years was involved in an affair.

Remain faithful

When the one who vowed to desert all others and remain faithful, loving, and protective of you steps out behind your back, you land on your face, belly, and heart on the floor.

Even jumping off a cliff does not feel as hurtful or dramatic. When you have been faithful to them, blissfully trusting that they too were, you are stunned, shocked, and disoriented that they could so easily betray your trust and break the vows of fidelity.

Infidelity trauma causes a myriad of reactions in the victim, including feeling worthless, numb, angry, humiliated, depression, intrusive thoughts about the affair and so much more. It cuts deep, especially when committed by a so-called Christian spouse.

Read: I want to stop cheating and be a better man

This is because we hold them on a pedestal. We assume they meant every vow of fidelity, love, and honour they declared in the presence of more than 500 souls. But human nature is so often deceitful that we must let people earn our trust instead of giving it away simply because they made a vow.

As devastating as it is, you can recover. Therapy, long walks, times in isolation, copious bottles of wine to boot, but one day, as you are busy doing your mundane work, a light will flutter.

You will not even be sure that it is a spark. “Maybe an electrical fault.” You will tell yourself. But the light will not go out. If anything, it will continue flickering, growing, building, and one morning, you will wake up feeling lighter.

The world will look beautiful again. You will notice the red Nandi flame, whose vibrancy compliments the Jacaranda in bloom. You will smile at strangers, say, “Excuse me,” and “Pole” when you bump into each other in the streets.

Then, love will find you from the blues and when you were not expecting or looking. Time does not cure heartbreak. Love does. Your tears will dry. This person will make you laugh, without trying. They will make you smile.

You will find yourself watching the rain and dreaming about fireplaces, companionship, and ageing together. Maybe you are lonely after being betrayed and neglected, but who cares? This person feeds you the best medicine, laughter.

Read: My wife thinks I cheated on her

They become your accountability partner, in your healing journey and the pursuit of your dreams, your purpose.

They complement your curves, which you thought were the reason that your ex-spouse chose to cheat. But now you know better that someone committing adultery is their personal choice and has nothing to do with you.

Think twice, thrice even, before stepping out on your spouse. Unless you are a narcissist and are incapable of empathy, you do not want to be the source of the kind of pain for the mother or father of your children.

Yes, karma too does come around. She does not flinch. She metes out vengeance with glee.

Haiti transition council taps former PM Garry Conille to lead the country,"Haiti's transition council on Tuesday tapped former Prime Minister Garry Conille, who briefly led the country over a decade ago, to return to the role as the Caribbean nation works to restore stability and take back control from violent gangs.

The transition council voted 6-1 to install Conille as interim prime minister, a member told Reuters.

Conille's extensive resume in development, working largely with the United Nations, is considered key to shoring up international support as Haiti prepares to launch a UN-backed security mission led by Kenya, though its deployment has faced hurdles.

The transition council, which holds some presidential powers, and its head, Edgard Leblanc, acting as a de-facto president, are now tasked with holding elections before February 7, 2026, as laid out in Haiti's constitution.

""Following discussions within the transition council after hearings with the candidates for prime minister, Dr. Garry Conille was chosen by consensus to lead the government during this transition period,"" Leblanc said on X.

Conille's naming underscores progress in Haiti's political process and follows Prime Minister Ariel Henry's resignation in March after he left Haiti to seek support for the Kenyan security mission and was unable to re-enter the country.

President Jovenel Moise, who named Henry, was assassinated in 2021. Haiti has not had a president since.

""My sincerest congratulations,"" business leader Alix Didier Fils-Aime, who had also put his hat in the ring for the role, said on X. ""I'm still a patriot who believes in this country. Long live Haiti!""

Conille was prime minister for just seven months, resigning in February 2012 after losing the support of his cabinet and clashing with then-President Michel Martelly.

Conille and Martelly butted heads over reconstruction contracts following a deadly 2010 earthquake and a parliamentary investigation into politicians holding dual citizenship, which is illegal in Haiti.

Conille most recently held the post of regional director at U.N. children's agency Unicef.

He will now be tasked with fighting off rampant insecurity as gangs have expanded their reach.

More than 360,000 people are already internally displaced within Haiti, according to UN estimates, mostly from capital Port-au-Prince, due to the gang conflict.

Beatrice Chebet pays tribute to Ethiopia’s Tsegay,"World-great stories about middle and long-distance races in athletics can’t be complete without Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes.

Athletes from these two neighbouring countries have pushed each to great length and height, and as a result, world, championship and national records have tumbled.

From the days of Paul Tergat and Haile Gebrselassie in the late 90s and early 2000s to the trilogy of Vivian Cheruiyot, Tirunesh Dibaba and Meseret Defar - the two nations have given the sport endless memories.

Who can forget the battle between Olympic and world 1,500m champion Faith Kipyegon and former 1,500m world record holder Genzebe Dibaba that left fans on the edge of their seats?

Read: AK to select 10,000m Olympics team in USA

That story won’t end soon with Kipyegon, the current 1,500m world record holder, upholding her supremacy with the multi-world champion Beatrice Chebet and world 10,000m champion Gudaf Tsegay from Ethiopia joining the fray.

Chebet and Tsegay took their supremacy battle to the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League on Saturday in Eugene, United States, this time around, in the 10,000m race.

They say revenge is best served cold.

However, Chebet doesn’t think so after beating Tsegay to set a new 10,000m world record of 28 minutes and 54.14 seconds, making history as the first woman to break the 29-minute barrier over the distance.

Chebet erased the previous time of 29:01.03 set by Letesenbet Gidey from Ethiopia on June 8 last year in Hengelo, the Netherlands.

It’s at the Prefontaine Classic where Tsegay beat Chebet to second place and set a new 5,000m world record of 14:00.21 last year, where the Kenyan improved her personal best to 14:05.92.

Chebet, the 5km world record holder, has paid glowing tribute to Tsegay for playing a vital role in her success over the last two years.

“It wasn’t about revenge and rivalry painted negatively. We are best of buddies and we always try to help each other whether from Ethiopia, Kenya or somewhere else,” said Chebet, adding that Tsegay powered her to a world record-breaking feat at Prefontaine.

“Running with Gudaf makes me work hard to produce the best in me and Saturday's moments were no exception,” explained Chebet, the reigning Commonwealth Games 5,000m champion.

Chebet detailed how she faced Tsegay at the 2022 Zurich Diamond League final in a 5,000m race, where she won in 14:32, edging out the Ethiopian to third place in 14:33. They would again face off in the London Diamond League in July last year, where Tsegay had the final laugh, winning in 14:12.29 as Chebet settled second in a career-best 14:12.92.

Tsegay again beat Chebet to second place in 5,000m at the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League final last year, where she shattered Kipyegon’s three-month-old world record of 14:05.20 from Paris with a new time of 14:00.21.

“Facts don’t lie…I have improved my times in 5,000m and 10,000m because of Gudaf, who pushes me to the limit. We push each other to produce the best in athletics,” said Chebet, who had not planned to break the world record in Oregon.

"After taming Leopards, Police train guns on KCB in Cup final","They are not there yet, but Kenya Police coach Salim Babu believes his players have what it takes to shine in the Caf Confederation Cup should they clinch the sole berth to the continental showpiece.

Police qualified for the final of the Mozzart Bet Cup following their 1-0 win over 10-time winners AFC Leopards in the semi-final at Police Sacco Stadium on Monday.

The law enforcers will face KCB in the final. The Football Kenya Federation Leagues and Competitions Committee is yet to announce the date of the final.

KCB booked a ticket to the final following their 4-2 win over Kariobangi Sharks post-match penalties after they battled to a 1-1 draw in regular time at the same venue on Sunday.

Apart from pocketing Sh 2 million, the winner of the Mozzart Bet Cup represents the country in the Caf Confederation Cup.

“Should we win this title (Caf Confederation Cup), I’m sure we will advance deep ( into the competition),” said Babu.

Crowd trouble

“Most of my players are familiar with Caf competitions so it will not be very difficult for us,” added the soft-spoken coach.

The match resumed from the hour-mark where it was abandoned on Sunday following crowd trouble. It was played behind closed doors and under tight security.

Despite not having warmed up enough for the match following their late arrival on the pitch, Leopards were still the better side.

Midfielder Kayci Odhiambo forced Police’s goalkeeper Patrick Matasi to a fingertip save from a free-kick in the 63rd minute, before Rwandese striker Authur Gitego side-netted four minutes later.

Veteran midfielder Kevin Kimani forced Matasi to make a brilliant save at the stroke of regular time before a follow-up attempt by Ingwe from a corner-kick delivery hit the crossbar.

Captain Clifton Miheso rattled the foot of the goalpost at the stroke of the added eight minutes.

Tough final

Striker Tito Okello squandered Police’s best scoring chance at the stroke of regular time when he fired wide from close range. His seventh-minute goal on Sunday was all Police needed to reach the competition’s final.

Babu admitted that Leopards were the better side on Monday. And while he anticipates a tough final, he is sure of lifting the cup.

“It has been tough but I thank God we have won.  Our target is to lift the cup. The match against KCB will be tough but I know this is our year,” he said.

An infuriated Leopards coach Tomas Trucha did not address the press after the match.

Leopards chairman Dan Shikanda protested the decision by FKF Leagues and Competition Committee to have the match resume at the same venue.

He said they decided to play on Monday for the sake of avoiding a ban by FKF.

“It was annoying to be told at 10 pm (on Sunday) that we are playing today. We came to play today just for formality because they (FKF Leagues and Competitions Committee had bad intentions for us,” lamented Shikanda.

‘Cornered’ Hit Squad fights for survival in Paris Olympics qualifiers,"Kenya’s “Hit Squad” hopes of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics hang in the hands of two boxers at the 2024 Boxing Second World Qualification Tournament in Bangkok.

The ‘Hit Squad’ only have three bouts left in the event being held at Indoor Huamark Stadium.

The dangling hope is in women’s 66kg - welterweight - where rookie Friza Anyango faces Sonvico Emille (France), while Peter Abuti - another newcomer in the global ring - will face the winner of round 32, pitting Polish Mateusz Bereznick against Australian Adrian Paolletti on Thursday in the 92kg - heavyweight category.

Martha Amina (bantamweight) was due to fight Mongolian Munguntsetseg En Khjargal in the Round of 32 Tuesday last evening.

The ""Hit Squad"" members who have exited the tournament include 75kg-middleweight Elizabeth Andiego, 80kg-light-heavyweight Edwin Okong’o and deputy captain Boniface Mogunde.

Qualification opportunities are dwindling by the day as the second World Qualification Tournament enters the home stretch.

Not even the training in Cuba, one of the boxing powerhouses in the history of the Olympic Games, could salvage the image of ""Hit Squad.""

Cuban boxers have clinched 41 Olympic gold medals in the Olympics. Only the Americans have won more (50). Cuban boxers have collected 78 Olympic medals in boxing, emerging as the nation with the third most podium finishes.

After a disastrous outing at Dakar, Senegal, last September and at the first World Qualification Tournament in Busto Arsizio, Italy, there is no reprieve for the ""Hit Squad"" in Bangkok.

Bangkok offered Kenyan boxers a final chance to secure a quota for the Olympic Games Paris 2024.

When the ""Hit Squad"" arrived in Bangkok, president of the Boxing Federation of Kenya (BFK) Anthony “Jamal” Ombok, who was accompanying the team, said they were razor sharp and ready for second-world Olympics qualifiers.

Jamal described the elimination of Okong’o and Andiego as a “sad day for the Hit Squad.""

German Irina Nicoletta Schoenberger defeated Andiego with a resounding 5:0 unanimous decision on Monday.

The German will face Mexico’s Citlalli Vanessa Ortiz, also known as “Bellatrix,” who outclassed her opponent from New Zealand, Deanne Shontel te-paea Read, in the Round of 16 today.

Okong’o lost on points to Dalai Ganzorig of Mongolia in the Round of 32 in the light-heavyweight on Monday.

“We gave our best shot,” Jamal, who was elected BFK president in 2019, posted on his Facebook page.

Robert Napunyi Wangila (welterweight) and Chris Sande (middleweight) won gold and bronze medals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

Philip Waruinge took bronze in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and silver in the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Ibrahim Bilali (lightweight) won bronze in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, while Dick Murunga (welterweight) clinched a bronze in the 1972 Olympics in Munich.

How caretaker’s bid to take over his German employer’s building failed,"A man who had attempted to short-change his employer by claiming ownership of his property has suffered a setback after the Court of Appeal okayed his eviction from a building he was occupying illegally in Malindi.

Mr Amin Mohamed Hamid, whom Mr Werner Sebastian had hired to look after his house, had tried to prevent the German national from evicting him by claiming that he had a share in the property and would incur significant losses if kicked out.

He requested the court to issue stay orders to protect his interests while awaiting the outcome of an appeal he plans to file against his eviction. However, the Court of Appeal rejected this request, stating that Mr Hamid did not adequately justify his application.

Justices Agnes Murgor, George Odunga, and Kibaya Laibuta said they were not convinced Mr Hamid’s planned appeal would become meaningless if the stay orders were not issued.

“Insofar as the applicant’s case is anchored on the claim that he expended substantial sums of money to undertake improvements on the property, any sums, if found due, would be recoverable,” said the judges.

Malindi Estates Limited

The case goes back to 2005 when Mr Sebastian bought the property from Malindi Estates Limited and registered it in his name. The foreigner then built a two-bedroomed house on the ground floor where he lived and two additional houses — two-bedroomed and one-bedroomed units — on the first floor.

He then travelled back to his home country, leaving Mr Hamid to look after the property.

The court record shows that sometime in 2013, Mr Hamid cautioned Mr Sebastian to never return to Kenya due to an alleged warrant of arrest which had been issued against him.

“When I returned to Kenya in 2015, I found that Mr Hamid had rented out the property to third parties,” he told the court.

The German then moved to court to ask for various orders including that Mr Hamid and his tenants vacate the premises and a permanent injunction be issued to block them from entering or interfering with his property.

He also asked for an annulment of an agreement that Mr Hamid had entered into alongside other orders for payment of damages.

Mr Hamid denied Mr Sebastian’s claim but admitted that the foreigner was the owner of the property and that he built the ground floor of the house.

But, according to Mr Hamid, he is the one who completed the first floor after Mr Sebastian had given it to him as a gift.

The defendant further filed a counterclaim, asking the court to issue an injunction preventing Mr Sebastian and his agents from accessing, occupying or in any manner interfering with his enjoyment of the property.

Refund any amounts owed

“The foreigner, his agents or assigns be compelled to unconditionally restore my water pipes and make good any other loss that he illegally caused to be occasioned or removed from the two houses built on the first floor of the building,” he said. Mr Hamid asked the court to recognise an agreement relating to the two houses constructed on the first floor of the building and dated October 15, 2013, as a valid and legally enforceable contract.

Environment and Land Court judge Millicent Odeny had initially ruled in favour of Mr Sebastian in a judgment issued in November 2023. Mr Hamid is, however, aggrieved with this decision and wants the Court of Appeal to overturn it.

In his appeal, Mr Hamid has faulted Justice Odeny, arguing that she erred in law and fact by considering matters that she ought not to have considered and overlooking the material he had placed before her.

In their decision to reject a request for stay orders by the appellant, the Court of Appeal judges also took into account Mr Sebastian’s offer to refund any amounts owed to Mr Hamid.

Additionally, they noted that the foreigner’s ownership of the property is undisputed and Mr Hamid’s occupation stems from his role as a caretaker.

“Mr Hamid’s claim that he invested Sh300,000 in the alleged development of the first floor would, if found to be due, be recoverable in a claim for special damages. Indeed, it would not be difficult to recover such sums in the event that its appeal succeeded,” said the judges.

Humanitarian crisis: Samburu families displaced by banditry struggle for survival,"Agnes Leshikuya's face bears a dry smile, betraying the anguish she has undergone in the last three months.

Jostling for space in a makeshift shelter during the heavy afternoon rain, she finds room for some of her children while others brave the downpour.

""This is not our wish. We have been pushed to the walls by these criminals, bandits and cattle rustlers,"" Leshikuya says, her voice breaking.

She then wraps her one-year-old child in a Maasai shuka, grateful to be alive after an escape from Soit Pus village in Samburu County three months ago.

""Bullets ricocheted daily. Let me say they (bullets) were just raining. I was very lucky to escape alive together with my children,"" she recounts of the bandit attack that forced her out of her home, where she lost hundreds of livestock.

Approaching the Nkabaai area, the crowd appears like a marketplace, but closer inspection reveals internally displaced families totalling close to 300 constructing makeshift shelters.

The people were forced to flee from their villages and are now seeking safety at the Nkabaai Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp after bandits ransacked and burnt adjacent villages.

But even here, the likes of Leshikuya lament abandonment by the government.

“We eat but not every day and we are not even sure of where it will come from. But we eat,"" she says.

Endemic poverty and heavy rains compound the insecurity for these vulnerable people, and road-daylight attacks have become routine despite intensified security operations by police backed by the military.

Now, a humanitarian crisis looms as more people flee bandit hotspots, with hundreds of learners out of school after closures due to banditry. Four schools remain shut despite learners in other counties continuing with learning.

Locals told Nation.Africa the government should resettle them and provide them with relief food and other material interventions.

""We are law abiding citizens. We have already been displaced, and also others have just been told to vacate. Please, let the government resettle us,"" said James Lenaseyian.

Samburu County Commissioner John Cheruiyot insists on relative calm and government efforts to eliminate banditry.

The administrator said the government had already deployed enough security personnel, including the National Police Reservists (NPRs), to patrol and beef up security in the area.

""There are no alarming cases, and therefore there is no need to fear. We have our security officers patrolling the areas. I urge parents to take children to school without fear,"" Cheruiyot said.

Samburu Woman Representative Pauline Lenguris said that the insecurity in the region had reduced hardworking pastoralists to unimaginable poverty levels.

Lenguris said that the locals live in unsanitary conditions and urgently need food and non-food items.

""These are hardworking Kenyans confined here unwillingly. They have been pushed to unimaginable poverty levels because their animals were recently driven away by armed bandits,"" said Lenguris, adding that the activities of banditry have disrupted farming, pastoralism, the main occupation of the people in Samburu West parts of Samburu North.

President William Ruto recently ordered the deployment of military officers to rehabilitate classes destroyed by bandits, assuring parents of security for all learners and institutions in the troubled North Rift region.

The government is preparing an aggressive aerial operation to combat armed bandits in Kenya's North Rift region counties of Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Turkana, West Pokot and Laikipia.

For the first time, police will utilize sophisticated gunship helicopters to enhance their capacity against banditry and complex crimes.

Three weeks ago, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki announced that these helicopters, equipped with advanced surveillance and firepower, aim to give security forces an edge over bandits who exploit the rough terrains for attacks and evasion.

""The decision to acquire gunship helicopters stems from the need to bolster security forces' capabilities in dealing with highly organised and heavily armed bandit groups,"" said CS Kindiki. The helicopters are expected to be particularly effective in Malaso in Samburu and Mkogodo Forest in Baringo.

He spoke at the Mombasa Port after flagging off the second batch of 10 Armoured Personnel Carriers for the police service.

"High Court in Embu suspends muguka ban in Mombasa, Kilifi counties","The Mombasa and Kilifi governors were dealt a big blow after the Embu High Court stopped them from implementing their executive orders which banned the sale and transportation of Muguka in their regions. The case was heard on Tuesday, May 28.

The move followed the application by Kutherema Muguka Sacco and Embu County Assembly which sought conservatory orders to bar the two governors from enforcing the ban imposed on Muguka trade.

Justice Lucy Njuguna issued the conservatory orders, restraining the respondents or their agents from interfering with the Muguka trade at the coast.

She said the Court was satisfied that the application should be treated with the urgency it deserved.

She ruled that the executive orders issued on May, 22 should be shelved until July 8 when the suit will be heard interpartes.

The Judge directed that the governors be served with conservatory order papers within seven days.

Following the directive Muguka farmers celebrated, saying justice had been done.

""We welcome the conservatory orders, it is a win on our side,"" one of the farmers said at Muraru Muguka Market in Mbeere South.

Earlier the farmers had lamented that the move had messed up their business and vowed to fight until the Mombasa Governor Abduliswamad Sharif Nassir and his Kilifi counterpart revoked the ban.

Meanwhile, Governors from Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta have agreed to take part in talks led by the Agriculture Ministry on the trade of muguka.

This was after a phone call with President William Ruto, State House said.

“President William Ruto on Tuesday had a phone conversation with Governors of Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta counties on their concerns in the sale of muguka. The three Governors agreed to participate in a meeting of stakeholders to be convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock this week,” said a statement posted on the President’s social media platforms.

The call was a follow-up to a session on Monday between President Ruto and the leadership of Embu County led by the Governor.

“We agreed subsequently to convene a meeting of political leaders of the affected Counties next week,” explained the President.

Police hunt for suspects who murdered Mbita boda boda rider and raped his wife,"Police in Mbita, Homa Bay County, are hunting suspects linked to the murder of a boda boda rider whose wife was also raped during the attack.

The criminals are said to have abandoned a motorcycle they stole from the rider before going into hiding.

The incident happened at Got Rateng B village in the Nyamaji East sub-location at 4am on Tuesday.

According to Lambwe East Sub-location Chief Bernard Onditi, the criminals raided the rider's house where they carried out the attack.

He said the gang wanted to steal money from the rider that well-wishers had donated to help him buy a new motorcycle after an earlier robbery.

""One of his motorcycles was stolen by unknown persons and he was left with the old one,"" Mr Onditi said. His colleagues heard about his misfortune and decided to help him buy a new one.

""He did not buy another motorcycle immediately but decided to repair the old one. It seems the criminals were after the money,"" the chief said. Mr Onditi said the rider was sleeping with his wife when the gang stormed their house.

The horseman was hacked while his wife was raped. Mr Onditi said the woman had recently given birth and was still recovering.

Died while receiving treatment

""She had a five-day-old baby,"" the administrator said.

The boda boda rider died while receiving treatment at the Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital.

His wife was also taken to the hospital for treatment. Mr Onditi said a resident found the stolen motorcycle abandoned in a thicket.

The resident also recovered a mobile phone belonging to the deceased. Mbita sub-county police commander Solomon Barng'etuny confirmed the incident and said a team of officers had been deployed to investigate.

The body of the deceased is at the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting post-mortem examination.

Last week, a group of boda boda riders asked police to step up night patrols in the town, claiming that a vicious gang of criminals was targeting them.

Homa Bay Town boda boda chairman Richard Opiyo said they had lost five motorcycles to criminals in the past month.

""Our only hope is in the hands of the police,"" the rider said.

African-American wants court to grant him Kenyan citizenship by ancestry,"An African-American who is seeking to be recognised as a Kenyan citizen by ancestry, has claimed that he suffered name-calling when he lived in the US.

While testifying before a Mombasa court, Mr Mubarak Abdul Muqsit Akram said since his childhood and into adulthood while in the US, he and his family were called “coloured people” among other derogatory names.

Mr Akram wants the court to order State authorities to issue him a Kenyan citizenship.

He says he chose to settle in Kenya because he feels it is close to him, adding that Kenyans are good people.

“I have chosen Kenya and not other countries. My choice of Kenya as my ancestral home is informed by the fact that modern-day Kenya was part of the larger African territory from where my descendants were forcibly caught and enslaved to America,” says Mr Akram.

Mr Akram, who was testifying before Justice Olga Sewe, added that Kenya is closer to the Red Sea where he can cross over and visit holy sites.

He explained that his parents were African-American and not Caucasian, as such he believes he has an inalienable right to return to his motherland and ancestral home, which is in Africa.

“I’m gainfully employed and not seeking any compensation from Kenya. I request a Kenyan identity card and passport. I am not a refugee,” Mr Akram told Justice Sewe.

He says that, cognisant of his roots and heritage in the African continent, he visited Kenya briefly for the first time in 2003 and later returned in 2008, and ever since, he has found solace, warmth and comfort albeit as a “foreigner”.

The petitioner is seeking a declaration that under the rules of international law and the Constitution, his right to return to his ancestral home and the choice of Kenya as his country of return is guaranteed and ought to be protected by the State.

National Identity Card

Mr Akram also seeks an order that the Director of Immigration and Citizen Services be directed to within 30 days of the judgment, recognise him as a Kenyan citizen and issue him with a passport and National Identity Card as a right.

The petitioner says he has made several applications for registration as a Kenyan citizen to the Department of Immigration but has never received any response.

Mr Akram says he was born in the state of Texas in 1946 to African-American parents and that since his return to Kenya in 2008, he has established and registered several businesses which he runs from his operating base in Kwale County.



The petitioner, who holds a foreigner certificate, has sued the Cabinet Secretary for Interior, Department of Immigration and Citizen Services Director-General and the Attorney General.

Upon cross-examination by lawyer James Kemei for the AG, Mr Akram told the court that the Immigration Department issued him with a foreign certificate.

Legal and justifiable claim

Assistant Director of Immigration Services Ronnie Akedi, in his replying affidavit, states that the petitioner’s belief and conviction that Kenya is his motherland is misplaced and ill-advised.

“There is no probable justification as to how the petitioner has singled out Kenya, out of 54 African countries, as being the country where his descendants’ origins emanate way before the partition of Africa into modern-day states,” says Mr Akedi, adding that the petitioner’s investing in the country does not in itself present criteria for one to be registered as a citizen.

Mr Akedi says the petition does not disclose any legal and justifiable claim against the respondents and that it ought to be dismissed.

According to the petitioner, his choice of Kenya as his ancestral home is anchored in and informed by the provisions of The Abuja Proclamation — a declaration of the Pan African Conference on reparations for African enslavement, colonisation and neo-colonisation, which was sponsored by the African Union held in Nigeria in April 1993.

The petitioner says that among the provisions of the proclamation was a declaration calling upon all African states “to grant entrance as of right to all persons of African descent and right to obtain residence in those African states if there is no disqualifying element on African claiming the right to return to his ancestral home”.

Hearing resumes on June 12.

Sende Moto: Inside an estate's struggle for a blessing,"To a stranger visiting Engineer Town in Nyandarua County for the first time, learning about Sende Moto estate might be shocking.

The estate’s name is notorious for its reputation for crime, prostitution and other illicit activities.

Of concern is that it has been a thorn in the flesh of law enforcers in the Kinangop area and is infamous for prostitution, murders, rape and being a notorious criminal hideout.

Locals, however, view the name as routine and unremarkable and having grown up there and knowing it since childhood, it's no big deal. The area is also well known for all the wrong reasons, including brothels and illicit brews.

Despite Sende Moto’s proximity to the Engineer Police Station and sub-County headquarters, it remains a headache for law enforcement officers.

“It is not unusual to hear someone shout in the streets that they are heading to Sende Moto, or identifying a person living there by that name. This is similar to how residents of big cities proudly identify with their urban dwelling,” says Joy Gachiri, a resident.

Previous attempts to cleanse the area have been in vain, as have been efforts by religious leaders to rename the area from Sende Moto to Kirathimo (blessings).

There is a common belief that ""the only thing one can't find at Sende Moto is life, but you can lose one there.”

Mugo Nyakerie, a resident, describes the place as a ""carefree world, where patrons can enjoy their life without fear. Things that happen there remain a guarded secret, whether they are done during the day or under the cover of darkness.""

Mugo told Nation.Africa he lost his property due to the estate's alluring lifestyle. He owned a shop and a plot within Engineer Town but took refuge in alcohol due to domestic squabbles.

He ended up selling the land in Sende Moto during one of the drinking sprees.

""This place is a comfort zone for anyone looking for peace, and you will get all the happiness you need. Most of those who have lost property were swindled by twilight girls and were easily lured by the cheap life at Sende Moto. Deals involving illicit land, vehicles, and other transactions are sealed at Sende Moto. Men have lost their property, and families have been auctioned since their property was sold and deals were sealed at Sende Moto. One can always get drunk with or without money,” he said.

Cleansing prayers

In November 2019, the clergy began cleansing the place with prayer sessions and anointments.

But Sende Moto has remained.

Bishop Mbuthia Njoroge, who led another clergy in cleansing the area, said the estate had destroyed families, with many men selling their land without family consent.

""The estate had also swallowed many businesses both small and prominent. By the word of prayer and confessions, we are never going to hear of murders, defilement, and rape incidents in this estate. Our youth, men, and women are going to change,"" said Bishop Mbuthia, who also chairs the local pastors' lobby.

However, Ms Gachiri believes that the cleansing by the clergy needs sustained efforts.

""We are talking of a community lifestyle, a lifestyle they have enjoyed for decades, some of them were born there. We can't change the name of a place before understanding that community, their lifestyle, and why they have accepted the lifestyle as a means of life. The change needed to start with reforming the residents, getting them alternative means of living,"" said the businesswoman.

She adds that life is affordable at Sende Moto, such that with Sh100, one will feed, get drunk, and enjoy cheap sex.

“It's only at Sende Moto where you can have a meal at Sh10 or Sh20, a cup of soup retails at Sh10, and a toast at Sh10, that is enough lunch for low-income earners. Most of the meals retail at Sh20 at Sende Moto, why would anyone leave such an affordable lifestyle without a better alternative? You can get a piece of meat at Sh10, but you don’t have to ask what animal it is or where it came from, that is why it's impossible for things to change at Sende Moto,” explained Ms Gachiri.

Cheaper housing

Rental houses are also affordable at Sende Moto, with monthly rent between Sh300 and Sh500.

Senior Chief Magdalene Kariuki shares these sentiments and notes that things have improved since the mass closure of bars in the area.

“We did everything to change the lifestyle, we had many prayer sessions and anointments but things have remained the same. All the bars in that estate were closed down, but we have a challenge because that is where most of the commercial sex workers reside. Unfortunately, most of them are not from Engineer Town, they come from neighbouring Laikipia and Nakuru counties, and some are from very far away,"" she said.

Chief Kariuki suggests that a lasting solution involves getting alternative sources of income for commercial sex workers.

""If we can change and positively keep the women busy, then we will have succeeded, Sende Moto will be the Kirathimo estate we want. I thank the national government for its commitment to fighting and eradicating alcoholic and drug consumption and trade. That support has helped, and the situation has improved at Sende Moto,"" said the administrator.

"Start-up turns marine plastic waste into eco-desks, chairs","Reasonably priced, durable and flexible, plastic pervades modern life, appearing in almost everything from packaging to clothes to beauty products. But it is thrown away on a massive scale.

According to the United Nations Environmental Agency, the world is inundated with plastic waste. Half of the 400 million plastic tonnes manufactured each year are meant for single use.

Large volumes of plastic remain in the environment for extended periods, posing a threat to both human and planetary health.

The primary cause of these escalating negative effects is the nearly exponential and ongoing rise in plastics usage and manufacturing worldwide.

The problem will probably get worse due to anticipated changes in consumer patterns, urbanisation and population expansion.

Less than 10 per cent of the 172 million plastic tonnes that are consumed in Africa get recycled. Between 19 and 23 million tonnes are thought to end up in lakes, rivers and oceans, having a catastrophic impact on the ecology, economy and society.

Local start-up TwendeGreen Eco-cycle recycles marine plastic waste from informal settlements into high-quality, reasonably priced, and long-lasting school eco-desks and chairs, while also fostering job opportunities and economic growth for the surrounding community.

This helps to address Kenya’s growing marine plastic waste problem while contributing to education development.

The social venture was founded in January 2023 by Churchill Muriuki, Lawrence Kosgei, Zainab Mahmoud and Faraj Ramadhan.

“Mombasa Plastics Prize; an initiative that brought together young innovators from Mombasa to find innovative solutions to tackle marine plastic waste, gave rise to TwendeGreen Eco-cycle. Our team won this competition overall, which confirmed our vision and gave us the first push to make our idea a reality,” says Mr Muriuki.

“For us, receiving this award was not just an accolade; it was a spurt that drove us forward and gave us the self-assurance and means to make a big difference,” he adds.

He says their initial capital was Sh3.5 million which they won from the Mombasa Plastics Prize.

“We used it to purchase some of the essential equipment, leased a workspace and covered initial operational costs. This financial support allowed us to establish a solid foundation, from which we could start collecting, processing and recycling plastic waste into school furniture,” he says.

Mr Muriuki outlines the challenges faced by schools nationwide due to the high prices of wooden school furniture.

Their solution, which is now being introduced in schools in Mombasa’s informal settlements, leverages recycled plastic waste to manufacture affordable desks, that are both environmentally conscious and uncompromising in quality.

The company buys plastic waste from the local plastic collectors from informal settlements, community-based organisations, and plastic waste collecting companies that transport the plastics to the warehouse.

“The plastic is sorted, cleaned and shredded upon arrival at our facilities to get it ready for transformation. Plastic boards are then produced by compressing the shreds of plastic with a press moulding machine under high pressure and temperature. Our carpenters then cut and assemble these boards to create eco-friendly school furniture, including desks and chairs,” he says.

The main goal of the TwendeGreen Eco-cycle is to simultaneously address the severe issue of marine plastic pollution and the shortage of school furniture.

“As Mombasa natives, we all witnessed the grave challenges of degraded environmental conditions and insufficient educational resources,” says Mr Muriuki, adding that by combining these two urgent problems, they envisioned a solution to address both the environmental degradation and the community’s need for education.

An innate love of the environment drove the founders’ foray into the recycling industry. Their mutual love of sustainability and environmental preservation drew them together and inspired them to explore the potential of recycling.

“Mombasa generates approximately 120 tonnes of plastic waste every day, of which only five percent is recycled. A significant portion of this waste is dumped into the ocean. It takes 13 kilograms of plastic waste, which would otherwise end up in the ocean and pollute the marine ecosystem,” he says.

TwendeGreen Eco-cycle has developed close ties with the Mombasa County Ministry of Education, which has acknowledged and supported the company’s efforts to supply sustainable school furniture.

The company has also received approval and support from several respectable organisations, including USAID and Challenge Works UK.

“We serve primary schools, corporate entities, junior secondary schools, and non-governmental organisations. Our furniture solutions are made to last and are reasonably priced to cater for the different needs of our customers,” he states.

Currently, the company has employed seven people, including experts in a range of fields. Their prices, which range from Sh4,500 to Sh5,500 per desk, he says, are reasonable for their items and that once they start bulk production, the price will go down to affordable rates.

Their goals include becoming Kenya’s premier supplier of sustainable furniture, drastically lowering plastic pollution and supporting environmental conservation, even though he recognises that they have encountered challenges, such as changing people’s attitudes towards recycled goods and obtaining the necessary machinery for effective production.

Regarding entering the cut-throat market, he agrees that a multifaceted strategy is required.

“We leveraged social media to showcase our products to a larger audience. Our dedication to sustainability and quality helped us stand out in the congested industry, and marketing and advertising were key factors in developing our brand presence,” he says.

Looking ahead, TwendeGreen Eco-cycle intends to diversify into various types of office and household furniture, according to Mr Muriuki.

“We are committed to leaving a lasting impact through our work, and we believe in the power of innovation and collaboration to create a better world. In addition to endangering coastal tourism and marine life, marine plastics contribute to climate change. When plastics get into oceans, they break down into micro-plastics which are consumed by marine animals,” he says in conclusion.

The company has accomplished several noteworthy milestones. In addition to receiving the Mombasa Plastics Prize, they were privileged to meet both the US Ambassador to Kenya and King Charles during his royal visit to Kenya.

Sakaja suffers blow as his supplementary budget is slashed,"Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has been dealt a heavy blow after the office of the Controller of Budget (COB) cut down his Supplementary Budget for the ending financial year 2023/2024.

The Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang'o said some of the project funding have been reduced and some completely scrapped in the 2023/24 FY for failure to adhere to the Public Finance Management Act (PFM), 2012.

The Act provides specific guidelines on how budget variations should be conducted legally.

Section 135 of the Act states that the supplementary budget is required when there is a need to reallocate funds to different areas than those originally planned.

In its submission, the county had amended the recurrent budget expenditure for the County Public Service Board from the current Sh127 million to Sh130 million, which is an increase of Sh3.5 million.

However, upon examination, Ms Nyakang'o slashed the development budget under the Public Service Board by Sh10 million.

In the Public Service Management sector, the COB has reduced the Development Budget from Sh20 million to Sh10 million.

The development budget in the Agriculture sector has also been slashed from Sh96.3 million to Sh27.7 million.

The development budget that had been allocated to the County Assembly has equally been reduced by Sh915 million, leaving only Sh300 million in the budget for development out of the current total budget allocation of Sh2.4 billion to the County Assembly.

In Nairobi Revenue Authority sector, which the governor has been relying to collect Sh20 billion target in the ending year, COB has scrapped off the development funding of Sh100 million which had been allocated by the governor.

Additionally, COB has further revised down the development budget in the Inclusivity Public Participation and Citizen Engagement sector.

The original development budget in the Inclusivity sector was Sh560 million, which the country through Supplementary Budget had slashed Sh175 million.

However, that did not stop COB from reducing it by Sh476 million, only leaving the sector with a budget of Sh1.8 billion.

The Innovation and Digital Economy department has also been affected as COB reduced the development expenditure from Sh9.7 million.

The budget for the Ward Development Fund has equally been reduced by Sh655 million, leaving the sector with Sh1.3 billion, and not Sh1.96 billion as captured in the ending year.

The development budget in the Boroughs and Public Administration sector has been slashed from Sh1.19 billion to Sh748 million.

Health department has not been spared by COB, downgrading Sakaja’s development budget from Sh1.13 billion to Sh519 million.

The Mobility and Works sector has also been reduced from Sh3.3 billion to Sh1.7 billion.

Ms Nyakang'o COB stated that the reallocation of funds in the supplementary budget exceeded the ten percent limit of the total expenditure approved for some programs or sub-votes, which contravenes Section 154(2) (c) of the PFM Act.

Additionally, the COB said that some of the approvals were made without necessary approvals from the County Treasury, and in some cases, the County Assembly was not properly informed or did not approve the changes.

Governor Sakaja has also been spotted for requesting for relocation in some sectors without detailed explanations or justifications, which is a requirement under Section 154(2) (b) of the PFM Act.

Defending the Supplementary Budgets after being flagged, the County Executive Committee Member for Finance and Planning Mr Charles Kerich stated that budget estimates for the FY 2023/24 were submitted to among others make the budget alive to the realities of revenue inflows, and budget absorption among other factors.

Mr Kerich said the development budgets for County Public Service Board and Nairobi Revenue Authority were scrapped and that the allocations have been carried forward to the next financial year with the purchase of revenue mobilisation vehicles.

“The budget for the County Assembly was reduced as a result of an agreement with the County Government to provide land for construction of the administration block. The cost of acquisition of land and other attendant costs were hence knocked off the budget,” Mr Kerich said.

"Israeli attack on Rafah tent camp kills 45, prompts international outcry","CAIRO/JERUSALEM, May 27 - An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.

Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties.

""In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,"" he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers.

Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.

""We were praying... and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,"" said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf.

""All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.""

Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames.

More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.

Medics later said an Israeli airstrike on Monday on a house in Rafah had killed seven Palestinians, with several others wounded.

Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on ""precise intelligence"", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.

That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip.

Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

The U.S. urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion.

""Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said. ""But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.""

French President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""outraged"" over Israel's latest attacks. ""These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,"" he said on X. Several thousand demonstrators later gathered in Paris to protest against the offensive in Gaza.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected.

""International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,"" Baerbock said.

Canada's government said it was ""horrified"" by the deadly airstrike in Rafah, and called for an immediate ceasefire.

""Canada does not support an Israeli military operation in Rafah,"" Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a post on X. ""This level of human suffering must come to an end.""

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange.

NO SAFE ZONE

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings.

Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds.

Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze.

""The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,"" he said.

The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned ""the heinous massacre."" Egypt also condemned Israel's ""deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people"", state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law.

On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.

Egypt's military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating.

Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said.

In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

Damaris Okumu: My baby’s well-being made me quit nursing to start flourishing daycare,"Long working hours often left Damaris Okumu, a nurse, worried about her newborn son’s welfare. Barely six months after resuming work from maternity leave, the now mother of three had been treated to lots of inconveniences by her housekeepers.

So bad was the situation for Ms Okumu, a first-time mother then, who had to abandon her profession in 2015 to be a stay-at-home mother.

“I had spoken to my husband about the challenges and after some time, I decided to sacrifice my job for the safety of my son,” she says.

Her decision, she says, had been inspired by the injuries her son was nursing almost every week. The months-old boy also had rushes around his genitals which kept increasing, the doctors had advised that they could have resulted from the toddler overstaying in diapers.

Leaving the workplace earlier to take care of the young boy was also close to impossible since sometimes the duties would stretch to late at night.

Challenges

But this was not the first time she had witnessed similar challenges with a house help.

“I worked in the children’s section at a health facility before going into early retirement. During the few years I was employed, women would check into the facility with children who had sustained injuries or were unwell due to poor supervision by their caregivers,” says Ms Okumu.

While at home, she enrolled for a master’s degree course in public health and graduated in the year 2020.

During her free time, she was always researching on how to establish a daycare. Upon graduation, together with her husband, they decided to start up a baby care unit. A place where career mothers would drop their children without fears of the babies being mistreated; a home away from home.

After renting a space at the Kisumu Milimani Estate, she settled on constructing and equipping the facility.

The daycare founder says she had used Sh6 million family savings, to cater for new constructions, play parks, security camera installation, stationeries, landscaping, school van, renovation and license.

“The thought of having a daycare first crossed my mind before I left my job, I wanted to bring up my children the way I deemed right, check on them whenever I wanted to and without any fears,” says Ms Okumu.

Ms Okumu says she was also looking forward to fusing her nursing and public health skills to run the facility. The daycare's operations- Inventist School- kicked off in late 2021 with only six children; two were Ms Okumu’s sons.

She says she had employed a manager who also came in with her two children.

“The rest of the children belonged to two parents who had kept in touch after seeing us kick off the daycare construction and had promised to stay in touch,” says Ms Okumu.

When Powering SMEs visited Investist School, Ms Okumu was busy admitting new children.

She says that within the past two years, the school’s population has grown to 57. She has also expanded her services from the daycare to Grade Four.

“More children kept coming to our facility through referrals, by the end of the year, we had admitted quite a number,” she says, adding that the admission age is from one year.

She says they avoid admitting children below the age of one so as not to interfere with their breastfeeding programme.

Primary school

When the toddlers outgrew the daycare and were ready for primary school, their parents requested that the school could as well offer learning services.

Ms Okumu says she saw this as an opportunity and started with PP1 and PP2, years later, the parents had requested that she upgrade and before she knew it, they were in Grade Four.

“Hopefully, by next year, we will be at Grade Six. While I had only hoped to put up a daycare, look at how far we have moved,” says Ms Okumu.

Read: Drive to upgrade daycare facilities in city launched

The school founder says she charges Sh43,000 per term for the daycare services due to the range of services offered to the toddlers.

At the daycare, the one-year-olds are taught basic and academic skills to use washrooms while observing hygiene. The caregivers also have a role in helping the toddlers with their speech development.

“We train them how to express themselves, the basic words like salutation and sorry to help with socialising,” Ms Okumu says.

They are also taught how to hold objects including pens. The daycare also ensures the learners are well-fed with a balanced diet to help their growth and development.

The institution has developed a routine of mentoring young individuals, bathing, feeding and allowing them to sleep daily before their pick-up time. The learners in pre-school pay a fee of Sh42,000 while Grades one to four pay Sh43,000 per term exclusive of a uniform fee.

Safety of learners

“The daycare services kick off as early as 6am and may close as late as 8 pm depending on requests from parents,” says Ms Okumu.

She further explains that for the safety of the learners, they have employed trained teachers to take the children through the sessions. The facility has also mounted CCTV cameras in various rooms to monitor how the teachers and caregivers take care of the toddlers.

Ms Okumu however says that she is considering running the daycare during school holidays this year due to requests she has been receiving from parents.

Currently, all her three children are at the institution with the last born who just moved to Grade One last year.

Back at home, Ms Okumu says she still has a house help, but her duties are now only restricted to housework.

She says one of the challenges is having a few toddlers at the daycare during school holidays.

“My motivation has however been staying on despite challenges and acknowledging that I was starting something that should outgrow our lifetime and aspiration,” she says

She concludes: “I believe I have helped to solve the problem faced by most career mothers including myself.”

Okutoyi battles for last shot at Paris Olympics,"African Games women’s singles tennis champion, Angella Okutoyi, starts her last lap of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games on Tuesday with two tournaments lined up on the hard courts of Tennis Club A.S. Marsa in La Marsa, Tunisia.

Okutoyi, who is up six places to 496 in the latest WTA singles rankings, is in the main draw in the W35 La Marsa tournament and will face Georgian fourth-seeded Mariam Bolkvadze (329) in the first round.

The Kenyan needs to get into the top 400 by June 10 to qualify for her first Summer Games set for July 26 to August 11 in the French capital.

The Auburn University second-year student currently has 109 points. To get into the Olympic qualification bracket, Okutoyi must get not less than 50 points from this week’s  W35 La Marsa tournament, and the W50 La Marsa tournament from June 3-9.

ITF requirements

“I don’t have much to say at the moment, but I’d like Kenyans to put me in prayers as I head to these two tournaments,” Okutoyi, 20, told Nation Sport yesterday.

In a women's pro tennis tournament of W35 level with 16 players in the main draw, one gets four points for reaching Round 16, eight in the quarter-final, 14 in the semi-final, 23 in the final, and 35 for clinching the title.

The W50 tournament with 32 players in the main draw sees one collecting one point in the Round of 32, six in the Round of 16, 11 in the quarter-final, 20 in the semi-final, 33 in the final, and 50 for winning the crown.

This means Okutoyi has her work cut out as she must make it to the final of the two events to meet the International Tennis Federation (ITF) requirements for players ranked outside the Top 400, who are also champions in their continents.

Anything less than a final could end her hopes of becoming the first-ever Kenyan to compete in tennis at the Olympics.

First-round bye

She placed herself in the race for the Paris 2024 Olympics by winning the African Games in March in Accra, Ghana.

Enroute to the title, she got a first-round bye and then saw off Zambian Naomi Chileshe 6-3, 6-1 (Round of 32), Egyptian Merna Refaat 6-3, 6-3 (Round of 16), Moroccan Aya El Aouni 6-4, 6-4 (quarter-final), Egyptian Mayar Sherif 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (semi-final) and Lamis Alhussein from Egypt 6-4, 6-2 (final).

Beating Sherif, who was ranked 70th globally at the time, was Okutoyi’s first-ever victory over a player ranked in the Top 100.

Sheriff, who won bronze at the African Games, is currently ranked 72nd after dropping 19 places in the latest rankings after losing 2-0 to American Peyton Stearns in the Morocco Open final in Rabat on May 25.

The top 56 players in the world qualify directly for the Olympics.

Teen gang sucks life out of vibrant Tana River town,"It is no longer safe to be out and about after dusk in Madogo town.

A marauding gang of teenage criminals christened the “Kayole Brothers”, has taken over the bustling urban settlement that used to be the pride of Tana River County as the only town that operated 24 hours a day in the region.

But now, when darkness falls, terrorised residents shut themselves in their houses hoping for the best but resigned to their fate.

By 6pm, businesses begin to close and by half past 7pm, the town yields to the darkness, opening the door for the teenage gangsters to reign.

A power blackout that has persisted for the past 30 days has made matters worse.

“I have had to retrench workers from my pub business because we can’t operate at night and running a generator has proved to be too expensive,” Mr Japheth Mutua, who operates a bar in the town, told the Nation on Monday.

Gang protection fees

For those willing to risk it and run their businesses till daybreak, they must pay the gang protection fees.

The criminals charge Sh1,000 per night for bar owners and Sh500 for shopkeepers and hoteliers. The protection fee is, however, valid only while within the premises and the client's safety while outside is not a guarantee.

Residents leaving work at night have also mastered the art of negotiating with the delinquents for their security.

“I part with Sh100 every day to be escorted home. Once I leave work, I must tag along with one of them or else I become a target,” said Ms Anne Silwa, a shop attendant.

Tana River County Police Commander Ali Ndiema told the Nation that patrols have been intensified.

He notes that whereas the teen gang dubbed the “Kayole Brothers” is a menace, security officers have reduced their activities and influence around the town.

“We are doing our best and appeal to residents to support us by reporting cases of crime and helping us to catch these characters instead of tolerating them,"" he said.

Further, he warned that parents of suspected gang members will equally be held responsible for crimes committed by their children if they are arrested.

“Every parent should know where their children are. If we get bad reports or we happen to arrest any child involved in criminal activities, the parent will also be charged for conspiracy,"" he said.

Madogo is in darkness because the electricity poles for the main power line fell as a result of the flooding along the Madogo-Garissa highway.

The lack of power has inconvenienced residents. The few people who are able to own solar panels are charging phones for people at a fee of Sh50.

Clean water has also become scarce because electric water motors cannot be used as a result of the blackout. Locals are forced to buy water from vendors or fetch from River Tana amid a cholera crisis in the county.

""We are suffering, businesses are making big losses and others cannot operate. People are losing jobs. This is killing our economy,"" said Hashim Bamaru, a resident.

Schools are not able to have evening preps, and management of the learning institutions are spending a lot of money to buy water.

Residents say that their appeal to Kenya Power Company to restore electricity has fallen on deaf ears.

Restoring power line

""Nobody is explaining to us the difficulty in restoring the power line. We are not seeing any explanation online nor have heard anything on the radio. They just decided to ignore us,"" said Mohamed Abdikadir, a resident.

Human rights activists have announced a week-long protest if the situation is not resolved at the end of a seven-day ultimatum.

“These people have a right to Kenya Power services and they have a right to proper explanation. If Kenya Power is having a problem we should be told so that we can know the way forward,” said James Rashid, secretary-general Civil Society Organisations Network.

Kenya Power County Manager Silas Limo said flood waters from River Tana knocked down electricity poles.

""We are keen to restore power in Madogo, but the area is still flooded, so it may take time to fix the poles. I appeal for patience,” Mr Limo said.

Mitigate climate change by using green energy,"By Ann Amollo

Green energy comes from natural sources that are clean and renewable, contributing to a sustainable environment.

Advances in technology have enabled organisations to innovate and develop energy sources with lower carbon emissions, resulting in reduced environmental pollution. This leads to fewer cases of diseases that affect both children and adults.

These natural energy sources are highly beneficial as they are cost-effective. For example, solar energy harnesses power from the sun and wind energy uses the wind, both of which are abundant and free.

Renewable energy sources are emerging, significantly impacting our environment and helping to mitigate climate change.

Advocating green energy use is essential to raise public awareness of climate change. By promoting these energy sources, we can achieve long-term environmental sustainability and positive climate change.

Green energy has many benefits to society. Through awareness campaigns, communities have adopted these renewable, clean energy sources, creating a conducive environment for sustainable living.

Let us be custodians of nature by promoting clean energy for long-term environmental sustainability and climate improvement.

Ann Amollo, Migori

Record-breaking Beatrice Chebet sets target for Olympic Games,"Freshly-minted world 10,000 metres record holder, Beatrice Chebet, has set herself an ambitious target of competing in both the 25-lap race, and women’s 5,000m at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

On Saturday night, the 24-year-old world cross country and world 5,000m champion broke the world record in women’s 10,000m by seven seconds at the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, in USA.

She became the first woman to run the race in under 29 minutes when she shattered Ethiopian runner Letesenbet Gidey’s world record of 29 minutes, 01.03sec from June 8, 2021 in Hengelo, the Netherlands with a blistering new time of 28:54.14.

This is the second world record that Chebet, who is also the Commonwealth Games 5,000m champion, is breaking inside a year.

Chebet brought down the 5km world record (women-only) on the road after clocking 14:13 at the Cursa dels Nassos road race in Barcelona, Spain on December 31, 2023.

“I am going to double in the two races in Paris but my target is to run the 5,000m first, then the 10,000m ,” Chebet told Nation Sport on Saturday. It was her first victory over 10,000m in a race held outside the country and her second ever over the distance.

“I’m particularly happy to run a world record here at the Prefontaine Classic,” explained Chebet, who produced the best last kilometre of two minutes and 47 seconds on her way to rewriting women’s 10,000m history books on track.

Even though Athletics Kenya was using the race to pick its team for the Paris Olympic Games, the focus was on Ethiopia’s world 10,00m champion Gudaf Tsegay, who had called for a world record pace at the race.

Things turned bad for Tsegay, the 5,000m world record holder as Chebet, the world 5,000m bronze medallist turned on the screws.

“The last lap just motivated me, especially when Gudaf dropped off. I then realised I had a good chance of winning and I took it,” said Chebet. She took up the challenge to go toe-to-toe with Gudaf, who had requested a world record pace.

“I decided to keep pace with her so as to see how I would respond. My body responded well then I decided to go to the end,” Chebet, who thanked her management Rosa Associate, her coach Gabriel Kiptanui and everyone at home for their great support, said.

Chebet also shattered the national record of 29:32.53 held by Vivian Cheruiyot from the 2016 Rio Olympics Games.

Tsegay and Chebet treated fans to thrilling moments as they battled at the front to stay ahead of the green wave light that indicated the world record pace by two metres. Chebet dropped Tsegay with 1,000m to go to win.

Seasoned road runner Daniel Mateiko won men's 10,000metres race ahead of world 5km bronze medallist Nicholas Kimeli to second place.

Mateiko won in a world lead and personal best time of 26:50.81 as Kimeli also set personal best 26:50.94 to all claim the Paris Olympic tickets.

Bernard Kibet came third also in personal best 26:51.09 in a race where six athletes ran under the Olympics standards of 27 minutes.

However, world 10,000m silver medallist Daniel Simiu came a distant eighth in 27:24.33 and can only bank on selectors for a node in the team for Paris Olympics.

Kenya is yet to win the men’s 10,000m title at the Olympics since the late Naftali Temu’s exploits at the 1968 Mexico City Games.

The country has yet to win in women’s 10,000m since the race debuted at the Summer Games in 1988 Seoul. Sally Kipyego (2012 London) and Vivian Cheruiyot (2016 Rio) claimed silver medals as the best performers.

Other Kenyans - world 800m champion Mary Moraa and Beatrice Chepkoech - finished second in their respective 800m and 3,000m steeplechase races.

Moraa clocked season's best 1:56.71 but lost to Olympic Games silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson, who set a world lead of 1:55.78.

Chepkoech, the winner in Xiamen and Shanghai, timed 8:56.51 to lose to Olympic champion Peruth Chemutai from Uganda in a world lead and national record of 8:55.09.

BAT offers farmers Sh200 per kilo to stem mass exit,"BAT Kenya has raised tobacco leaf prices to nearly Sh200 a kilo in a bid to rein in a sustained drop in the number of contracted farmers.

Latest disclosures show the cigarette maker raised the pay per kilo by five percent to Sh198.75 in the financial year ended December 2023 (compared to Sh189.2 the prior year) even as grower numbers fell below 2,000 for the first time in years.

The fall in the number of contracted producers, mainly in western Kenya and who numbered over 5,700 a decade earlier, has coincided with a fall in the amount of tobacco being supplied to BAT, putting the company under pressure.

The firm has been responding to this decline through different initiatives such as offering free tobacco seedlings, fertiliser and personal protective equipment as well as encouraging crop diversification by issuing farmers free or subsidised maize and avocado seeds to plant and earn an extra income without abandoning tobacco.

1,672 farmers

BAT closed last year with 1,672 farmers, a 19.7 percent drop from 2,083 in the previous year, meaning that it has lost about 67 percent of the 5,000 farmers it had five years earlier.

Many tobacco farmers, mainly drawn from Bungoma, Busia, Migori and Homabay, have been transitioning to alternative high yielding crops like beans and maize with help from anti-tobacco lobbies.

BAT’s Sh198.75 per kilo paid to farmers last year amounted to Sh954 million, marking the second straight year that the payout is below Sh1 billion. Total pay in 2022 was Sh946 million.

The amount of tobacco leaf delivered to BAT has declined for the fourth straight year, coming from 8.9 million kilos in 2019 to 4.8 million last year to mark the first time in about a decade that the number has dropped below five million kilos.

Hybrid tobacco seed varieties

BAT has been increasing the prices per leaf, hitting Sh198.75 last year, having crossed the Sh170 mark in 2022. The price per kilogramme was Sh118.70 in 2017.

It has also introduced ‘Thrive’, a global initiative that was rolled out by its parent company, BAT Group, in 2016 to make tobacco farming attractive.

BAT Kenya used the programme to introduce hybrid tobacco seed varieties to enhance crop yield and disease resistance. The firm has also introduced low-cost technology, including the use of mechanised ploughing and ridgers, as part of efforts to cut costs and maximise returns for farmers.

"Police, Leopards semis clash called off due to crowd trouble","The second semi-final of the Mozzart Bet Cup between Kenya Police and AFC Leopards at Police Sacco Stadium was on Sunday aborted in the second half due to crowd trouble.

Police were leading 1-0 courtesy of Tito Okello’s seventh-minute header when centre referee Brookes Onyango brought the match to a halt in the 62nd minute after assistant referee Simon Kuria was hit by a projectile by a suspected Leopards fan.

Things were made worse after a section of fans breached the barrier between them and the pitch.

Leopards chairman Dan Shikanda criticised the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) for allowing the match to be held at the Police’s turf, saying it can’t host a high-risk match.

Shikanda said FKF turned down their request to have the match played at Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Kisumu was turned down by the federation and vowed not to have the match replayed at the same venue.

“It will be very unfair (if FKF awards Police a win in the match) because we were on top of our opponent since the second half started,” said an angry Shikanda. “We want the match replayed in a proper stadium with the proper organisation for us to get a proper team to play in the continental.”

Part of the FKF rules states that “if a match cannot start or cannot be played in full, or remaining match time shall be played and/or concluded on the next day, without prejudice to any possible disciplinary measures.”

Shall fix a new date

“In case a match is abandoned, and the Organising Committee decides a continuation of play, the match shall recommence with the same score at the minute at which play was interrupted. For the avoidance of doubt, the Organising Committee may decide a full replay of the match that was abandoned. If the match cannot be rescheduled the next day, the Organising Committee shall fix a new date.”

By the time of going to press, FKF had not issued a decision on the match. But sources at the federation told Nation Sport that the match is likely to resume behind closed doors at the same venue today at 10am.

Earlier at the same venue, KCB progressed to the final after defeating 2018 champions Kariobangi Sharks 4-2 in post-match penalties after they battled to a 1-1 draw in normal time.

Apart from pocketing Sh2 million, the winner of the Mozzart Bet Cup also represents the country in next season's Caf Confederation Cup. Both Police and KCB are eying their maiden appearance in the continental club football tournament.

Saved two penalties

Goalkeeper Faruk Shikalo was the hero for KCB after he saved two penalties.

Striker Derrick Otanga had put KCB ahead in the 76th minute, but Fortune Omoto equalised for Sharks two minutes later.

With the two sides still tied 1-1 at the end of an additional 30 minutes, the match was decided in penalties.

Otanga, Henry Onyango, Danson Chetambe, and Brian Ochieng were on target for KCB, while Sharks’ two goals were scored by Kevinluke Otiala and Fredrick Alushula.

Stanley Wilson and Geoffrey Onyango were denied by goalkeeper Shikalo. KCB’s coach Bernard Mwalala is hoping to lift the Mozzart Bet Cup for the second time after guiding Bandari to victory in 2019 where they defeated Sharks 3-1 in the final.

“We played very well but there are areas we must improve on ahead of the finals. It feels really good to again be in the finals,” said Mwalala.

Holders Kakamega Homeboyz were bundled out by KCB by a solitary goal in the quarterfinals.

Trump booed and heckled by raucous crowd at Libertarian convention,"Washington,

Presidential candidate Donald Trump was booed and heckled by many in a raucous audience at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night, a marked change from the adulation he receives at rallies from his fervently loyal supporters.

Libertarians, who believe in limited government and individual freedom, blame Trump, a Republican, for rushing through the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and for not doing more to stop public health restrictions on the unvaccinated during the pandemic.

When Trump took to the stage in Washington, there were loud boos and jeers. A smaller section of the crowd, Trump supporters, cheered him.

Shortly before he appeared, one Libertarian Party member shouted: ""Donald Trump should have taken a bullet!""

Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hostile reception.

Trump, who was president between 2017 and 2021, immediately mentioned the total 88 felony charges he faces in four federal and state prosecutions.

""If I wasn't a libertarian I am now,"" he said. He denounced the administration of President Joe Biden, his challenger in the November 5 election rematch, and Biden's fellow Democrats as being part of a ""rise in left-wing fascism"".

Trump was trying to appeal to libertarians, who have more in common with Republican policy positions than Democrats on issues including taxes and the size of government, in what is expected to be a closely fought election.

1.8 million votes

He added: ""We should not be fighting each other."" He asked libertarians to work with him to defeat Biden, an appeal which was greeted by many boos, although the vast majority in the crowd were fiercely opposed to Biden and his administration.

Libertarians garnered only 1.2 percent of the national vote in 2020, or about 1.8 million votes, but November's election could be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states, so Trump is seeking to peel away some libertarian support.

Trump's appearance at the libertarian gathering, unusual for a Republican White House candidate, also signalled how seriously he and his campaign take the threat of third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long opposed vaccines and mandates, and who spoke to the convention on Friday.

Trump has been ramping up attacks on Kennedy, who is running as an independent, recently calling him a ""fake"" anti-vaccination proponent.

Opinion polls suggest Kennedy will siphon votes away from both Trump and Biden, but it is not yet clear which of the major-party candidates will be hurt more by Kennedy's long-shot White House bid.

Libertarian Party

Libertarian Party organisers said Biden was also invited to speak to the convention but he declined to attend.

""The Libertarian Party can make a big difference. If we unite we will be unstoppable,"" Trump said to a mix of applause and jeers.

Trump said he was a ""libertarian without even trying to be one,"" and that the Libertarian Party should endorse him, another line greeted by boos and jeers.

Undeterred, Trump poked fun at the crowd, saying if they did not back him, they would continue to garner just a tiny portion of voter support in national elections.

He pledged to put a libertarian in his cabinet if he wins the election, which was met by cries of ""bullshit!""

Trump did get huge applause for one promise. A rallying cry for libertarians is the case of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a life sentence for creating and operating the website Silk Road, which allowed users to secretly buy and sell drugs and other illegal products.

Libertarians believe Ulbricht's 2015 sentence represents government and judicial overreach. In front of a crowd holding ""Free Ross"" signs, Trump promised to commute Ulbricht's sentence if he wins back the White House.

Chief Kadhi Abdulhalim Athman stops man from evicting estranged wife,"Chief Kadhi has issued an order stopping a man from evicting his estranged wife from their matrimonial home or taking anything from it, pending the hearing and conclusion of a case involving a property dispute between the couple.

Chief Kadhi Abdulhalim Athman said the woman, identified as MAM, will suffer irreparable damage if she is evicted from the matrimonial home and her household items are taken away.

""MAM has nowhere else to go and her right to dignity, housing and accommodation will be prejudiced,"" he said.

At the same time, Chief Kadhi has temporarily delegated the management of the property to an estate agent while a dispute between the couple over its ownership is resolved.

The agent will be selected by the couple's lawyers and approved by the High Court before taking charge of the property, which includes rental houses, and collecting rent.

Rental houses

""The rent proceeds will be distributed as follows while this matter is pending: 35 per cent to the woman and 65 per cent to the man,"" said Chief Kadhi Athman.

However, Chief Kadhi ruled that the man, identified as the COR, had contributed significantly to the construction and development of the rental houses.

""He will thus suffer more damages than the MAM if the orders sought are granted as prayed,"" he said.

Since both parties would incur losses in the event of an unfavourable ruling, Sheikh Athman ordered that the rent be collected and distributed according to the contribution ratio until the dispute was resolved.

Last year, the woman went to court to seek injunctions against the man, his family members or representatives to prevent them from entering, building, trespassing or interfering with her matrimonial home, property and property rights.

She complained that the COR had threatened to evict tenants from rental houses and to collect all household items from the matrimonial home.

The man, however, opposed the application and requested that it be dismissed.

Court records show that the parties were married more than 10 years ago under Islamic law.

Matrimonial home

They initially lived together in rented houses owned by the woman's mother, before jointly purchasing a plot of land on her mother's land and building three-bedroom houses. The man worked abroad to earn an income and often visited his wife in Kenya.

Sometime in 2011, they bought an additional plot of land next to their matrimonial home and built rental houses on it.

Following the completion of this project, ownership and management became a point of contention between the couple.

The court noted that there was no dispute that the parties were still legally married under Islamic law, that the matrimonial home was purchased jointly, and that the rental houses were built during the marriage on land originally owned by the woman's relatives.

""However, the court has the right and authority to declare the rights of the parties to the disputed matrimonial property,"" Sheikh Athman said.

The Chief Kadhi, however, noted that the division of matrimonial property begins upon the dissolution of the marriage.

Okutoyi wins doubles title in Tunisia tourney,"Africa Games champion, Angella Okutoyi of Kenya, playing alongside Egypt’s Merna Refaat, has won the doubles title in W15 Monastir tournament in Tunisia.

Okutoyi and Refaat defeated the Chinese duo of Yi Liu/Jiayu Xu 6-2, 6-2 on the hard courts of Hotel Skanes Family Monastir in Tunisia yesterday.

Fourth-seeded Okutoyi and Refaat went into the final having caused a major upset by seeing off top seeds Zeel Desai (India)/Daria Khomutsianskaya (Belarus) 6-3, 6-1 in the semi-finals in 58 minutes on Friday evening.

The Chinese pair defeated Alyssa Reguer (France)/Arlinda Rushiti (Kosovo) 6-1, 6-3, in the other last four match.

The W15 is the lowest tier of women’s pro tennis.

Okutoyi from Auburn University in the USA is warming up for make-or-break tournaments in the Tunisian city of La Marsa beginning next week as she seeks to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

In the final, Okutoyi and Refaat dominated in serves and won four of six break points compared to Liu/Xu, who did not win at break point five times. Okutoyi/Refaat won all eight games when serving and were also good in receiver points.

It is Okutoyi’s second W15 Monastir doubles win after clinching her first with French partner Beverley Nyangom on July 16, 2023.

En route to her second doubles win in Monastir, Okutoyi/Refaat swept aside Jiaying He/Ying Xhang (China) 6-2, 2-6, 10-7 in the first round and then earned a walkover in the quarter-final against Onyu Choi (South Korea)/Bianca Compuesto (Australia) before tossing out Desai/ Khomutsianskaya in semi-finals.

Okutoyi, who will be leading Kenya's Billie Jean King Cup Africa Group III at the Nairobi Club from June 10-16, did not compete in singles in Monastir where fellow Kenyan Cynthia Cheruto got knocked out 6-2, 6-1 by Daria Kudashova from Russia in the first round.

W15 doubles winners get 15 world ranking points and losing finalists 10, as well as prize money of Sh127,015 and Sh68,495, respectively.

Okutoyi, who became the first Kenyan woman to win a women's pro tournament singles title during the W15 Monastir tournament on July 30, 2023, which was also her first professional title, now shifts focus to W35 La Marsa slated for May 27 to June 2 and W50 La Marsa scheduled for June 3-9 where she will be competing in singles while hoping to collect crucial points to get into the top-400 to qualify for the Paris Olympics.

She is currently ranked 502 globally with 109 points in singles, meaning she needs 50 points from the two tournaments to get into top-400 before June 10 deadline.

"Mombasa-Nairobi expressway will not hurt SGR, Murkomen assures traders","Construction of a six-lane Nairobi-Mombasa expressway that is expected to reduce travel time from Kenya’s capital to the coastal city to 4.5 hours, down from 10 and a half hours, will not affect the operations of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), the government has said.

Roads and Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said the toll-road deal, which involves a 440-kilometer link between Nairobi, and Mombasa that serves as a gateway for several East African economies will complement the existing infrastructures to make the Northern Corridor more competitive.

Mr Murkomen dismissed fears that once the toll road is ready, the SGR will be disadvantaged as cargo shifts to road transport.

He added that the SGR extension, the Mombasa-Nairobi Expressway and later Rironi-Mau Summit Expressway will make the Northern Corridor an irresistible option for many businesses in the East and Central African region.

“I am the CS of both roads and rail [and can assure you] the government has no intention of prioritising one over the other. We shall ensure rail and road provide seamless flow of cargo from the port of Mombasa to other parts of the region,” said Mr Murkomen.

Speaking during the launch of the Kenya Railways Strategic Plan 2023-2027, the CS said the railway intends to increase cargo volumes from 26 percent to 42 percent in 2027.

“We are challenging Kenya Railways to improve its services to attract more users so as to attain its vision. The government will not favour any mode of transport by issuing mandatory use of rail edicts to increase its volumes,” Mr Murkomen pledged.

The announcement comes few days after local private investors were given a chance to participate in the financing of the Sh472.9 billion expressway after the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and US-based private equity Everstron Capital LLC signed a deal to kickstart construction.

""The road, dubbed ‘Usahihi’, is expected to have four to six lanes and will be constructed over the next 3-4 years.

""Usahihi will pay its way, not burdening the government as it is structured as a Public-Private Partnership with revenue coming from road users. Usahihi will organise finance, construction, tolling, operation, and maintenance of the expressway under a 30-year concession with construction lasting 3-4 years,"" read the press release announcing the deal.

The CS spoke a day after he held a virtual meeting with US Secretary for Transportation Pete Buttigieg on several areas of cooperation, including road safety, mass rapid transport and aviation.

Mr Murkomen and Mr Buttigieg discussed green transport in the Nairobi Metropolitan Area and explored avenues for knowledge exchange and capacity building in the sector.

Apart from the Mombasa-Nairobi expressway, the government is committed to extending the SGR from Naivasha to Malaba on the border with Uganda and beyond to enhance competitiveness of the Northern Transport Corridor.

“To this end, we will collaborate with the Interstate Ministerial Committee on the SGR Cluster to explore viable financial options to ensure that SGR extends from Malaba through Kasese in Uganda and finally Kisangani, in the DR Congo, to boost regional trade,” said Mr Murkomen.

He said the Kenya Railways Strategic Plan 2023-2027 is meant to steer the implementation of priority initiatives in the rail transport sector over the next five years.

The Plan outlines ambitious goals for Kenya Railways, including the development and enhancement of rail infrastructure, expansion of freight and passenger transport, increasing market share of the port of Mombasa, fostering a skilled workforce, and institutionalising Environmental, Social, and Governance standards.

Why law requires seizing suspected rabies animals,"May 4, 2024 shall remain etched in my memory as one of the days I handled a case with possible devastating consequences, that fortunately never materialised.

I was busy doing a report when Emily, our admin, alerted me of boys with a sick dog in the waiting room.

She asked me to quickly attend to the animal as the children said the dog had bouts of fainting. In her opinion, the animal was very ill. She said the doctor on duty was busy with another patient while Dr Mwikali had already left for a house visit.

I trust Emily’s judgment and case scheduling because her many years of experience and operational training have positioned her to organise patients for the doctors available at any time at the clinic.

Newly-qualified doctors and students, encountering her in action for the first time, ask how she manages the work without formal animal health training.

I explain that professionals need to understand and appreciate that operational management is common in all fields of practice and is better carried out by people who are not trained in the particular discipline as long as they are initially trained in administration and well-trained in operations of the specific professional service they are employed in.

Read: Do not confuse this cow disease with deadly rabies

I found seven boys in the waiting room. One was holding a dog on a leash. The animal was coiled up under a seat and looked oblivious of its environment.

The boys appeared under 14 years. One stood out as the obvious leader of the troop.

He smiled, stood up and extended his hand to greet me.

I clenched my fist and gave him a “corona” greeting. The dog’s posture and red eyes immediately raised my rabies antennae. Greeting the boy with an open hand could expose me to the rabies virus.

Saliva foam

Emily gave me a disapproving look and shrugged out of sight of the children. She later explained to me she thought my action was customer unfriendly. She had quickly changed her mind when she heard me tell the boys to thoroughly wash and disinfect their hands immediately.

The dog was a rabies suspect and the boys who had handled it were probably exposed to the virus.

One of the boys said he had wiped off saliva foam from the dog’s mouth with his bare hands to keep the animal clean.

Francis, the band leader, demanded to know why I thought the dog was rabid, yet it appeared very calm and had not attacked them.

They had walked with the animal for about two kilometres. The only thing they observed was weakness in the hind quarters and the animal would tire easily and collapse.

That was the only reason they had brought it to the clinic.

Readers of this column may recall I have narrated cases of rabies in cattle and dogs.

However, each has a different perspective that helps understand the various aspects of the deadly disease.

Read:   Beware, that beloved dairy cow could kill you

In this case, the history of hind leg weakness, frothing at the mouth, dullness and inability to swallow two doughnuts the boys had given the dog were rabies infection red flags.

The red eyes I observed, even without touching the dog, further enhanced my suspicion.

After getting the history and making observations, I secured the dog with a catcher, fitted the mouth with a muzzle and continued examining it closely.

The eyes were very red, there was dried saliva on the lips and two bite wounds on the face. The lymph nodes were swollen and the dog had lots of ticks. The animal failed the water test.

Dogs with rabies show hydrophobia or fear of water. They turn away their heads when water is presented to them to drink.

This reaction is caused by a painful throat due to paralysis of swallowing muscles caused by rabies infection. Even water swirling causes the dog to turn its head away from the direction of the sound.



Rabies infection

I took some blood for in-house lab analysis. The results showed dehydration and some blood parasites spread by ticks. It is the parasites that had caused the swelling of the lymph nodes.

I treated the dog for the dehydration and blood parasites. I then explained to the children that their innocence had made them vulnerable to rabies infection.

They had seen a dog mistreated by other children and made to fight another dog. That is how the animal got the bite wounds on the face.

The boys had decided to bring the dog for treatment at the clinic, oblivious of the danger they were in.

Fortunately, the animal had the dumb form of rabies where the patient is deeply depressed and prefers to coil and rest.

I told the boys that the animal would remain at the clinic until we confirmed if it had rabies or not.

They protested they only had Sh100 and could not afford the treatment and admission cost.

I explained the matter was no longer about money but their safety, that of their community and the other animals in the village, including cows, goats and pigs.

The law requires us to impound all rabies-suspected animals presented at the clinic, confirm the disease and report to the veterinary and health authorities.

We agreed with the children that they would bring their parents to the clinic because they could not legally make decisions.

On May 7, the National Veterinary Research Laboratories in Kabete confirmed the dog indeed had rabies.

The rabies confirmation report started a new cascade of events that are ongoing. I shall narrate it in future.

Pastoralists embrace crops to beat climate change effects griculture,"During the long drought last year, Mohamed Godana – a herder in Isiolo – lost more than 50 cows and at least 100 goats.

For now, pastoralists are a happy lot, with pasture and water in plenty, owing to the heavy rains.

“There is enough milk and food for my family when it rains. Drought, however, spells doom for we have to move long distances in search of grass and water. We even buy fodder,” Godana tells Seeds of Gold in Garbatulla.

“We take our animals to Meru National Park but that comes with challenges too. Grazing there is not permitted and wild animals attack our livestock.”

Godana wishes to have camels but prices are prohibitive. The Godana and other pastoralist families are changing livelihoods as a way of coping with the deadly effects of global warming.

Ali Kuno, another Garbatulla resident, says droughts and flooding have rendered many households destitute. The camel is the preferred animal.

“Because droughts have become unpredictable and long, many families have sold their cows and goats and bought camels instead. The problem is the cost of one camel. An adult camel is about Sh200,000,” Kuno says.

Integrated farming

Crop farming is one of the ways of coping with the vagaries of weather.

Fridah Kairuthi is the leader of a women’s group that engages in integrated farming. The group of around 15 plies its trade on a two and half-acre piece.

The women grow tomatoes, capsicum, spinach and other vegetables. They also have cows. The waste from the cowsheds is used to make biogas.

“I also make fodder. The by-product from the biogas is good manure. This is profitable. Our lives have improved,” Kairuthi says.

She has witnessed thousands of animals die during dry spells. Diversifying has helped pastoralists weather the storm of droughts.

“Families come to buy our fodder during dry seasons. We can make up to Sh30,000 in three months. It may not look much but the money helps us take care of our families,” she says.

In Kinna ward is another group of women practising integrated agriculture on 10 acres. The group is known as Malka Bisanadi Cultural Village.

Group leader, Makal Mamo, says the women grow drought-resilient crops like beans, grass for fodder, chilli and sweet potatoes. The group also practises goat, poultry and fish farming. It has a kitchen garden too.

“Making fodder is important because we are able to feed our goats and sell the surplus during drought,” Mamo says.

From the farm, the 25 women can make up to Sh300,000 a year. They save their money through table banking.

“We’ve also won the war on malnutrition as our crops are nutrient-rich. However, convincing pastoralists to shift to crop production is not easy,” she says.

Packaging camel meat

Malka Bisanadi Cultural Village group has started packaging camel meat. The women cut steak into small pieces and fry, giving it the flavour of a dish that is locally known as nyirinyiri. It has a shelf life of three months.

Pastoralists have been integrated into the agri-food system, which studies show, account for up to 30 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions globally.

Agri-food system refers to activities related to producing and consuming food. Experts want agro-pastoralists given practical training in order to understand the new environment.

“Increased temperature, changing rain patterns and prolonged droughts are challenges to farming communities. Food systems need to be climate resilient,” says Kevin Gitau Ng’ang’a, the Kenya Climate Action Strategist at Clim-Eat, an organisation helping farmers tackle challenges related to global warming.

“Farmers are encouraged to practise regenerative agriculture, which involves crop rotation, cover cropping, no-till farming and rotational grazing. These rebuild soil health and increase biodiversity,” he says, adding that pastoralist families need to be assisted to buy camels.

Gitau encourages dialogue between farmers, devolved governments and other stakeholders.

Paris Olympics trials: Just who’ll blink first?,"The Kenyan trials in 10,000 metres for the Paris Olympic Games will take the limelight at the Prefontaine Classic scheduled for tonight at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon in the United States of America.

And some fast times are expected in both the men’s and women’s 25-lap race, especially with the additional Ethiopian flavour in the women’s battle. The programme starts at 10.40pm (Kenyan time), with the women’s 10,000m race taking place from 10.50pm. Men’s 10,000m race will take place from 12.05am, and men’s 100m early tomorrow (1.12am). Women’s 800m race will be run tomorrow morning from 2.34am.

Two-time reigning world cross country champion Beatrice Chebet, who is the world 5km, the world cross country champion and world 5km silver medallist Lilian Kasait, will once again take on each other at the stacked Olympic trials.

World half marathon silver medallist Margaret Chelimo, world half marathon bronze medallist Catherine Reline and the 10km world record holder Agnes Jebet Ng’etich are also in the mix.

Emmaculate Anyango, who rose to fame this year to represent the country for the first time at the World Cross Country Championships and Grace Nawowuna, who competed at the World Cross Country and World Championships last year, are on the start list.

Commonwealth Games 10,000m bronze medallist Selah Jepleting also joins the party. Apart from Kasait, who is eying her second Olympic Games appearance after finishing 12th in 5,000m at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games, the rest hope to make their first Games appearance.

Interestingly, world 10,000m champion Gudaf Tsegay from Ethiopia will join the Kenyans but on a different mission - to continue her record-breaking form.

Tsegay won

After downing Faith Kipyegon’s 5,000m world record of 14:05.20 within two weeks last year with a new time of 14:00.21, Tsegay took a shot at the Kenyan’s 1,500m world record of 3:49.11 at the Doha Diamond League on April 20 this year.

The Olympic Games 5,000m bronze medalist, who ran a superb 3:50.30 to win in Doha, will be taking a shot at the 10,000m world record held by fellow Ethiopian Letesenbet Gidey of 29:01.03 from 2021 Hengelo.

The 2023 world 10,000m silver medallist Daniel Ebenyo, who has the event’s leading time this year, and Benson Kiplangat, the 2021 world Under 20 champion, are among the Kenyan men to look out for. Both events are non-Diamond League races.

The 2022 world 10,000m silver medallist Stanley Waithaka and Nicholas Kimeli, who finished fourth in 5,000m at the Tokyo Olympics and world cross country this year, are also on the men's start list.

Kibiwott Kandie, the former world half marathon record holder and Commonwealth Games 10,000m bronze medallist, the 2021 world under-20 10,000m champion, and Samuel Chebolei, who finished fifth at world cross country this year, are among others to look out for.

Chebolei is also joined by his elder brother Ronald Kwemoi, who represented Kenya in 1,500m at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, finishing 13th in the final and Daniel Mateiko, who finished eighth in 10,000m at the 2022 World Championships.

Kimeli and Simiu were part of a trio that represented Kenya in 5,000m at the Tokyo Olympic Games, where they finished fourth and 12th, respectively and will be eying their second appearance at the Summer Games.

“It’s every athlete’s dream to be at the Olympics and I hope to perform well,” said Simiu, who upon settling for silver at the World Half Marathon in Latvia, declared that it was the last time that Kenyans would see him winning silver as he plans an assault in 10,000m at the Paris Olympics.

With home athlete Olympic 800m gold medallist Athing Mu out of the race, the focus is now on the reigning world 800m champion, Mary Moraa, in the 800m.

Moraa, who won the Doha Diamond League in 1:57.91 on May 10 before cracking 50.56 in 400m at the Los Angeles Grand Prix on May 18, will test herself against Keely Hodkinson, the Tokyo 2020 Olympics 800m silver medallist.

“My target is to run good times from what I have done this year, “said Moraa, who won the Kip Keino Classic in 1:57.96 and Doha in 1:57.91.

Africa record holder Ferdinand Omanyala will take on three-time world champion medallist Christian Coleman, the Olympic silver medallist Kenny Bednarek and the reigning World Indoor 60m bronze medallist Jamaican Ackeem Blake in 100m.

Coleman won the race last year, beating world champion Noah Lyles and Omanyala to second and third places, respectively.

More than 300 buried in Papua New Guinea landslide,"Sydney

More than 300 people and over 1,100 houses were buried by a massive landslide that levelled a remote village in northern Papua New Guinea, local media reported on Saturday.

Hundreds are feared dead in the landslide that hit Kaokalam village in Enga Province, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of capital Port Moresby, around 3am on Friday (1900 GMT on Thursday).

The landslide in the Pacific nation north of Australia buried more than 300 people and 1,182 houses, the Papua New Guinea Post Courier said, citing comments from a member of the country's parliament, Aimos Akem. Akem did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment via social media.

More than six villages had been impacted by the landslide in the province's Mulitaka region, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said on Saturday.

""Australia’s High Commission in Port Moresby is in close contact with PNG authorities for further assessments on the extent of the damage and casualties,"" a DFAT spokesperson said in a statement.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported on Saturday that four bodies had been retrieved from the area after emergency teams reached the sparsely populated area, where the death toll is expected to rise.

The landslide has blocked highway access, making helicopters the only way to reach the area, the broadcaster reported.

Social media footage posted by villager Ninga Role showed people clambering over rocks, uprooted trees and mounds of dirt searching for survivors. Women could be heard weeping in the background.

Prime Minister James Marape has said disaster officials, the Defence Force and the Department of Works and Highways were assisting with relief and recovery efforts.

Kenya’s ‘Hit Squad’ on the ropes with final chance to punch 2024 Paris ticket,"If there is one qualification that is making hearts of genuine boxing fans in Kenya skip a heart beat, it is the elimination tournament at The Indoor Stadium Huamark in Bangkok, Thailand.

This world qualifier, that started yesterday and runs unto June 2, is the last opportunity for the hitherto-feared “Hit Squad” to punch a ticket to the Paris Olympic Games.

The six Kenyans who are hoping to turn their lifelong Olympic dreams into reality include female fighters Amina Martha (bantamweight), Friza Anyango (welterweight) and veteran Elizabeth Andiego (middleweight).

The men's brigade has Edwin Okong’o (light-heavyweight), Boniface Mogunde (light-middleweight) and newcomer Peter Abuti (heavyweight).

The technical bench has head coach Musa Benjamin, David Munuhe (deputy coach) and John Waweru (trainer) who are all International Boxing Association (IBA) three–star coaches.

More than 600 elite boxers from 133 different countries will be battling for a spot in the Paris Olympic Games 2024 scheduled to take place from July 26 to August 11.

A total of 51 (23 for women and 28 for men) Paris 2024 Olympic quota places are available in this qualifiers.

Winners in each category together with first and second runners up will earn their passage to the Games

Die-hard boxing fans in Kenya have every reason to worry considering no boxer from the country has secured their place in the Games thus far.

So the Bangkok tour is literally a do-or-die affair for the six fighters.

Kenya’’s tale of missed chances started on September 9-15 at the Dakar Arena, Senegal where all the country’s boxers flopped.

The pattern was repeated at the first World Qualification Tournament in Busto Arsizio, Italy, from 3 to 11 March 2024.

The worried boxing fans are aware that anything short of a first three placing at The Indoor Stadium will mean Kenya pugilists not climbing the North Paris Arena and at Roland-Garros Stadium where the boxing tournament will be held in Paris.

The stark reality is that Kenya is at the risk of failing to have a boxer at the Olympic Games for the first time since 1964 when five represented the country

The “Hit Squad” made their maiden appearance in the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games where the late Philip Waruinge from Nakuru and Alex Oundu finished ninth overall in the featherweight and lightweight categories respectively.

The Other Kenyan boxers at the 1964 Games were John Kamau (flyweight), John Olulu (light welter) and Gichere Gakungu (welterweight).

Kenya boycotted the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada and the 1980 Moscow Games due to political reasons.

Celebrated international boxing referee and judge Joseph Mwangi Muthoga popularly known as “Don King” who has officiated in the Commonwealth Games, five editions of the All African Games, the 2008 Beijing Olympics and at numerous international says the lack of youthful boxers may be Kenya’s undoing .

“The average age of our boxers is 30 years while our opponents from Europe, Asia and the US are 20 years. Kenyans boxers cannot match their speed and agility in the ring. Our opponents have graduated through the youth development,” said Muthoga.

At the same time, he said officiating in the international qualifiers is key.

“African referees and judges are very few and don’t get equal opportunities like their counterparts in Europe and Asia. It is important for Africa to have enough officials in such qualifiers because you can’t rule out the possibilities of officials ganging up to favour their teams,” said Muthoga who qualified as IBA referee/judge in 1994 in South Africa.

He added: “The final qualification is in Asia and I worry that officials from Asia may collude and favour their fighters who did not qualify in Italy.”

However, Muthoga who is a two-star IBA referee/judge blamed African governments for failing to support the advancement of boxing referees and judges in their countries.

“Development of referees and judges in Africa is zero. African government must go back on the drawing board and ensure we have many qualified international referees and judges to counter Europe and Asia.”

He said the failure of qualified IBA international referees and judges to accompany ‘Hit Squad’ in competitions outside the country due to lack of funds denied them the much needed exposure.

However, he said the six-member ‘Hit Squad’ has what it takes to qualify for the Paris Olympics as they had gained relatively good exposure last year and this year.

“12 members of the team went to Havana, Cuba last year for special training where they got the required exposure, which is very rare to come. If you add the Italy and Dakar qualifiers, Kenya should not miss victory in the Bangkok qualifiers,” said Muthoga.

“I have officiated Okong’o. He’s a powerful boxer with a vision. Mugunde is an equally skilful boxer while the rest are also perfect according to their records,” said Muthoga.

Muthoga said Kenya lacks junior boxing and women development strategies to prepare budding boxers for international assignments.

“Boxing should start at the school level but when we have primary and secondary school games boxing is not featured and that is where there is a weak link in the development of this game. Counties should invest in boxing through inter-county games to raise our standards,” observed Muthoga.

Super clash of the big cats,"Two-time champions Cheetahs and Lions have made tactical changes ahead of their Rugby Super Series final clash today from 4pm at the RFUEA ground, in Nairobi.

Lion’s head coach Oliver Mang’eni, though, has opted for minimal changes, putting his trust in the side that stunned Buffaloes 20-5 in their preliminary round encounter in Kakamega.

Emmanuel Silungi takes over from Collins Kabayo, who drops to the bench at second row while Bob Muhati takes up the inside centre position replacing Charles Twandam, who moves to outside centre replacing Kennedy Claude.

However, Cheetahs coach Lawrence Buyachi has made seven changes, replacing Kevin Kiget and Brian Onyango with Francis Atiti and Desterious Ifedha as props.

Clinton Odhiambo replaces Barry Opondo as second row where he will partner with Tyson Okoth while Elkeans Musonye returns to replace Nelson Tengeye at number eight.

Seasoned former international Samson Onsomu takes charge at scrum-half, replacing youngster James Muthoni while Kenya Under-20 Philip Okeyo comes in for Javan Okwaro at centre where he will be paired with Tyson Maina.

Beldad Ogeta comes to the left wing instead of Alvin Khavoli’s while Dennis Abukuse will operate from right.

Lions, who have won the title once, are keen on gaining revenge on Cheetahs who beat them 18-16 a fortnight ago.

Lions won the title last in 2008 while Cheetahs clinched the second and fourth edition in 2004 and 2006 respectively.

Mang’eni said that his boys are yearning for revenge, having amended the mistakes they committed in their loss to Cheetahs in the series opener.

“We were lethargic and slow in reaction. More so, we didn’t take one-on-one tackles,” said Mang’eni.

Mang’eni reckoned one doesn’t change a winning outfit after he opted for minimal and tactical changes to the squad.

“Claude was red carded in our last match hence his replacement while Silungi’s return is tactical owing to his strong presence in the scrum,” said Mang’eni.

Buyachi expects quite a competitive and entertaining match of direct and running rugby.

""Cat fights are always vicious. We we shall be out to do what we are known for - play good rugby,"" said Buyachi.

He said he had made several changes after resting most of his players in their previous match, having already qualified for the final.

""We wanted freshness in the final match and more so give all the players some airtime,"" explained Buyachi.

Seasoned referee Constant Cap will be in charge of the duel assisted by Duncan Kioko and Kevin Wambugu.

"Israel's Netanyahu to address US Congress soon, says Speaker Johnson","WASHINGTON, May 23 - Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would soon address a joint meeting of Congress amid heightened tension with President Joe Biden over the Israeli leader's handling of the war in Gaza.

Delivering a keynote speech at the Israeli embassy's annual Independence Day reception, Johnson, the top congressional Republican and a critic of the Democratic president’s Israel policy, said it would be “a strong show of support for the Israeli government in their time of greatest need.”

Such a speech is sure to further anger progressive Democrats critical of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and Biden's support for it. Netanyahu has closely aligned himself with Republicans.

The diplomatic gathering in Washington comes amid strains between Biden and Netanyahu over a US push for Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians in the war against Hamas militants in Gaza.

The embassy gave equal billing to Democratic US Representative Pete Aguilar, who shared the high-profile platform with Johnson at a more subdued event under the shadow of the Gaza war. ""As Americans, we reaffirm our commitment to Israel's sovereignty,"" he said.

Speaking first, Johnson said to applause: ""Tonight I'm happy to announce ... we will soon be hosting Prime Minister Netanyahu at the Capitol for a joint session of Congress.""

Successive US administrations have usually sent a high-level official to the Independence Day receptions.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who in recent months has called the situation in Gaza a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and has urged a ceasefire, delivered last year's keynote, mostly extolling U.S. backing for Israel.

An Israeli official said this year the embassy wanted to honour lawmakers in a bipartisan way in appreciation for congressional approval of billions of dollars in new US military aid.

The reception took place on the same night as a White House state dinner for Kenyan President William Ruto, which the Israeli official said created a scheduling conflict for cabinet members.

Several less senior Biden aides were in attendance, including Derek Chollet, Secretary of State Antony Blinken's counsellor.

The White House declined to comment when asked whether it was consulted about the invitation to Netanyahu or whether Biden, who has denied an Oval Office meeting with the Israeli leader, might see him in Washington.

JOHNSON'S VEILED SWIPE AT BIDEN

Johnson and Aguilar both condemned the International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision this week to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence chief, Yoav Gallant. The prosecutor also asked for warrants to capture Hamas leaders responsible for the deadly Oct. 7 cross-border attack on Israel, which triggered the Gaza war.

Johnson took a veiled swipe at Biden, saying ""some leaders"" have sought to withhold ""vital weapons"" from Israel. Biden has paused one shipment of bombs and warned he could delay others if Netanyahu carries out an all-out ground offensive in the refugee-packed city of Rafah in southern Gaza. But the flow of weapons has mostly continued.

Security was tight around the National Building Museum where the reception was held. A small group of pro-Palestinian protesters shouted ""shame on you"" at guests exiting the event. One person held an Israeli flag stained red to simulate blood. Another on a megaphone accused Israel of war crimes.

On Tuesday, Johnson said he was close to inviting Netanyahu, a right-wing leader who had warm relations with former President Donald Trump.

Johnson, a Trump ally, had issued Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer an ultimatum to sign a letter inviting Netanyahu or else he would only speak to the House of Representatives.

Schumer had signalled he was open to Congress hosting Netanyahu, despite declaring in March that the Israeli leader had “lost his way” and calling for new elections in Israel.

Johnson did not specify a date for Netanyahu's speech.

Addresses to Congress are a rare honour generally reserved for the closest US allies.

Netanyahu has already given three speeches, most recently in 2015. That year, Republican leaders invited him without consulting Democratic then-President Barack Obama, as Netanyahu joined them in an unsuccessful bid to derail Obama's international nuclear deal with Iran.

Dozens of Democrats boycotted Netanyahu's last speech, raising the prospect that some could stay away this time.

Johnson, struggling to keep his fractious Republican House majority intact, has been a prominent voice in the U.S. political divide over Israeli policy. The politicisation of the issue has intensified ahead of the November election in which Biden is running against Trump.

In contrast to past years’ gala celebrations, this year’s reception, marking the 76th anniversary of Israel’s founding, was billed as a “solidarity event.”

Israel is fighting to wipe out Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Palestinian authorities say more than 35,000 people have been killed during Israel's campaign in Gaza.

The big secret: Why I don’t reveal my true income,"In the world of finance, transparency is king. Yet, where family and friends are involved, full disclosure can sometimes breed tension, enmity and unrealistic expectations.

Money, like a capricious spirit, can alter dynamics in the most unexpected ways. For this reason, some individuals keep their earnings tightly under wraps, a personal boundary set not out of deceit, but from the desire to preserve the authenticity of their relationships.

Jatoh Jemimah, 28Data Analyst I can never reveal my actual income. Disclosing such sets high expectations regardless of your financial commitments. People may not understand that your budget is tight and will expect financial help at any time.

From my experience, family members always expect financial support. Most parents assume their children are obliged to give them money. To manage this, I usually quote a lower income than I earn. When asked for an amount I don't wish to part with, I usually say I need to check my finances first, even though I know very well how much money I have.

I had a friend who was always ready to lend money. However, when she began facing financial difficulties, none of those who had benefited from her generosity offered help. This experience taught me to always be cautious about who I assist financially. People often exploit generosity, so I avoid revealing my wealth to prevent being taken advantage of.

My parents don't ask too much about my earnings, they are content with whatever I say I make. They support me through their prayers and only inquire about my financial well-being when necessary. They trust that I will be honest with them and honour my obligations.

My advice to other young professionals is, whenever you’re asked for assistance, offer a non-committal response like, ""I'll try my best."" Promising to send them a specific amount builds expectation. Keeping financial details private helps control expectations and ensures you don’t get overwhelmed by requests or added responsibilities.

Mukumba Edouard, 25Entrepreneur and InvestorI keep my income private because I realised it influences how people perceive me. With parents, I demonstrate self-sufficiency without disclosing any specifics. Among friends, openness varies. Some respect privacy, others do not. I noticed that discussing your finances openly among friends can introduce competition and make others start comparing themselves with you. It is a delicate balance where you need to share just enough and tactfully withhold the nitty gritty. This helps maintain harmony in relationships.

When discussing money, I often tell people that my income levels fluctuate depending on the profits we make. This shows that even I can't predict my exact earnings. It's about being realistic and also preserving personal boundaries. The way we present ourselves influences how others perceive and interact with us.

Managing personal finances can be hard, especially if there are people who rely on you for support. If you're assisting someone financially, they might keep expecting that help with little regard for your budget. For example, if they know you earn Sh100,000 monthly, they may wonder why it is so hard for you to support them with Sh10,000 every month.

In business partnerships, if one partner finds out that the other earns more, it could affect their commitment and contribution to the venture. One has to balance between being generous and maintaining good financial health. I know of a friend who instantly became the breadwinner of his extended family the moment he got a job. They all depended on him for support and this really drained him.

I have set strict financial goals for myself. I make a budget monthly to ensure I take care of my expenses and save, without exceeding Sh40,000. It's not about the amount you earn but the discipline to manage it wisely. Without discipline, you can't attain financial stability and independence.

Phancy Faisha, 24Videographer at CARE KenyaAdulthood has its own challenges, especially when you attain some level of financial independence. My parents have always supported me financially, but now that I earn from temporary NGO contracts, I have learned to keep my finances pirate.

Since I live at home, I am expected to contribute to household expenses. My family believes that because I earn, I am obligated to share my income with them. Thankfully, I have learned to balance between contributing to my family and maintaining my financial independence.

I also know that finances can strain friendships, particularly when expectations around spending arise. For instance, a friend might invite you to a party on a Friday night and expect you to buy drinks or food for everyone.

Failure to do so often leads to misunderstandings. Your friends will label you ‘stingy’ or ‘proud’, especially if they themselves are yet to find jobs. They may feel neglected or say that you've changed. This can significantly affect friendships especially if they don’t understand the boundaries and targets you've set.

When discussing salaries with friends, I prefer not to disclose exact figures. Sharing such information can lead to comparisons and potentially affect the mood and attitude in the group. I choose to keep the specifics of my earnings private to avoid unnecessary tension or jealousy.

Frankincense Wesley, 24Administrative assistant at Kenya Film Classification BoardI once had this conversation with one of my parents. It was exactly a month after I had secured a contract. Requests for money followed and a friend explained that it is called black tax. I don’t have many responsibilities, but I feel burdened with expectations simply because I am a man.

In my opinion, the decision to reveal one's earnings is largely influenced by cultural factors. Revealing such information can make one feel exposed and vulnerable. People may judge your spending habits. Conversely, if you earn well but choose to be frugal, you might face pressure to spend more than you want to. The only time I have disclosed my income was to individuals who I trusted. I shared the details knowing there would be no repercussions, and nothing more would be expected of me.

Some individuals can be quite intrusive and eager to put their noses in your financial matters. Balancing transparency with discretion is key. I am fortunate to have friends who rarely probe, but when financial topics arise, we discuss them in general terms, focusing on ranges or tax brackets rather than exact figures. Although a tax bracket can hint at one's income levels, it still maintains a level of ambiguity due to its broad range.

As a young adult, I am careful not to reveal too much because I don’t want others to scrutinise my spending habits or financial decisions.

I believe there should be a balance that involves withholding some details. I wouldn’t want everyone around me to know exactly how much I earn. So, I usually tell them a quarter of the actual amount to ensure I remain with enough to sustain myself and afford what I want.

This way, I balance the situation, knowing that the amount they will ask for won't put me in a difficult position. I call this amount a ‘hustler fund.' It gives me some breathing room. It might seem like deception, but I'm confident they would understand the need for me to survive, despite their expectations.

Vivian Alusa, 25Businesswoman and ModelI prefer to keep my income levels and sources confidential. Many people are unaware of my profession, and I believe that before one can inquire about my earnings, they should understand what I do. I choose not to disclose where my income comes from because I consider it a personal matter.

Whether I am financially well-off or not, that's a private aspect of my life that doesn't need to be shared with everyone. Revealing one's income often leads to judgment based on financial status, which I prefer to avoid. My take is that financial matters are private and should be treated as such.

I once confided in a close friend about my income, believing she would keep it confidential. However, she felt jealous and inferior because I earned more. I never intended to make her feel that way. Generally, I am open about this with friends and family, but I've learned that money is a sensitive and divisive issue. You have to walk a tight rope between transparency and privacy.

Also, when an individual learns that the next person earns a significant amount but still relies on others for support, it may raise some very difficult questions. Full disclosure is good, but it leaves one vulnerable. I strive to protect my financial information for my own safety and security.

Caleb Mumo, 29English and Literature TeacherPrivacy in financial matters is crucial. If relatives know you earn a substantial income, they may impose expectations or forget you have your own plans and challenges. Keeping some details of your income private keeps a bit of the pressure at bay.

I have also noticed that when some people get to know how much you earn, they may start spreading rumors that you are engaging in illegal or immoral activities. Additionally, if someone with a Bachelor's degree earns more than someone with a Master's, it could lead to disrespect or condescension, which could hurt professional relationships.

Some people are perceived to be selfish, but remember that the amount they can give depends on their financial situation and current needs. For instance, if I apply for a loan and get it, I will definitely not disclose this information because it can lead to unwelcome demands for money, and some may expect much more than I can provide, which may breed conflict and affect my goals and plans.

I don't feel pressured to share my income. Even when I choose to talk about it, I never disclose the exact amount. I always underquote. This way, I avoid setting unrealistic expectations. By being discreet, I allow others to form their own assumptions, thus preserving my financial privacy and autonomy.

Income disclosure is a personal choice, influenced by one's character traits and background. Allowing others to speculate rather than providing exact figures helps one set realistic expectations.

Top Kenyans athletes threaten to boycott Olympics trials,"Against the backdrop of a looming national trials for the Paris Olympic Games boycott by athletes, Athletics Kenya has insisted that the selection process will be held at a World Athletics-certified venue.

Athletes, who sought anonymity, vowed not to attend the trials that are scheduled for June 14 to 15 if they are held at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

Reacting to the athletes’ sentiments, AK President Jack Tuwei said he would not allow the trials to be held at a venue whose track has not been approved by Word Athletics.

Tuwei said he would strive to ensure that all athletes were given the opportunity to try and qualify for the Olympics.

Closed for renovations

Tuwei spoke on Wednesday during the last day of the National Athletics Championships at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

Athletics trials for Paris Olympics Games were initially programmed to take place at the Nyayo National Stadium but the Ministry of Sports has since closed the venue, forcing AK to consider holding the event at Ulinzi Sports Complex whose running track does not meet WA certification.

The Nyayo Stadium and the Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani that are the only venues approved by World Athletics were earmarked by for major overhaul in readiness for the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations.

MISC is in fact closed for renovations while Nyayo Stadium is partially open for athletes to use for training only.

Olympics standards

Nyayo is also one of the venues for this year’s African Nations Championships (Chan) in September. While launching the architectural designs for the venues last year, Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba promised that one of the facilities would be available for the national trials.

“Even though I have attained the Paris Olympics standards I will not attend in solidarity with those who would like to strive and get the standards at the trials,” said one of the athletes who participated in the recent National Championships at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

“These are sentiments shared by all the athletes because they have missed a great opportunity to qualify for Paris Olympics with the National Athletics Championships being held at Ulinzi Sports Complex,"" said the athlete.

One of the country’s top sprinters said that Nyayo Stadium track was fast and offered runners an excellent opportunity to qualify for the Paris Games.

Aggrieved athletes

The athlete singled out the 400m athlete Zablon Ekwam and 400m hurdles athlete Wiseman Were who attained the Paris Olympics qualifying standards during the Kip Keino Classic at Nyayo on April 20.

""We shouldn't allow for another boycott by athletes following what happened before the African Games trials,"" said another middle-distance athlete.

During trials for the African Games, aggrieved athletes staged a sit-in demanding for more spots in the continental affair.

AK had been given 35 slots. Namwamba intervened leading to the slots being increased to 52.

"Shock as missing woman found raped, murdered under neighbour's bed in Embu","Residents are in shock after a woman who had been missing for three days was found raped and brutally murdered in the sprawling village of Riangiri in Embu County.

Surprisingly, the decomposing body of the deceased, identified as Lilian Nkatha, 35, was found hidden under the bed in a neighbour's house.

Nkatha had injuries on her head, neck and left hand, a clear indication that she had been brutally murdered.

A casual labourer who was last seen with the deceased is now the prime suspect in the gruesome murder of the married woman with two children.

The man who owns the house has gone into hiding and detectives are looking for him for questioning.

According to the family and residents, the deceased disappeared around 11am on Sunday when she was last seen alive.

The family said Nkatha was called by the labourer in the neighbourhood and they went together, but the family became suspicious that something was wrong when the deceased did not return home in the evening.

On Monday, the family and residents began a thorough search of the farms and bushes for the deceased, but they did not find her.

Resumed the search

On Tuesday, the family and locals resumed the search and when they did not find the deceased, they reported the matter to the police for investigation.

On Wednesday, however, the family became concerned when they saw flies hovering over the neighbour's house and a foul smell emanating from it.

They reported the matter to the police, after which detectives went to the scene and broke into the house, which was locked from the inside, only to find the deceased lying in a pool of blood under the suspect's bed.

""When we learnt of our daughter's mysterious disappearance, we searched everywhere for her without success and then informed the police and took statements,"" said Rose Makena, Nkatha's sister.

Fell on deaf ears

Ms Makena narrated how their pleas to a local administrator to help them search for the deceased fell on deaf ears.

""When we told the administrator that our daughter was missing and we wanted his help, he ignored us,"" said Ms Makena.

The family said Nkatha called her husband Peter Muriithi, who works in Meru, on the suspect's mobile phone on Sunday morning and they spoke.

Nkatha asked her husband to send her money to buy food and he agreed.

But when Muriithi later called his wife on Monday to find out how she was, he could not reach her because the suspect's phone had been switched off.

Sensing danger, he rushed home and was shocked to find his wife missing and joined residents in the search.

""Sadly, my wife's lifeless body was found in the house where the suspect was staying,"" lamented Mr Muriithi.

The family wants to know the motive behind such a cruel act that has left everyone baffled.

They are also calling on the police to ensure that the suspect is tracked down and brought to book.

Crying for justice

""We are now crying for justice, our daughter's life has been lost and the person responsible should be punished according to the rule of law,' said Mrs Makena.

According to other reports, Nkatha was seen having drinks with the suspect at a local bar before she was reported missing.

Detectives have assured the family and residents that no stone will be left unturned.

""We are appealing to the family and locals to be patient and wait for the conclusion of investigations,"" said one of the detectives, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to brief the media on crime matters.

Detectives said the matter was being treated as a murder and the suspect would be charged with a capital offence once arrested and investigations complete.

They appealed to residents for any information that could help in the swift arrest of the suspect, who is well-known in the area.

Earlier, angry residents tried to demolish the neighbour's house in protest but were stopped by police.

Avril: This is why I have been away from the limelight,"Judith Nyambura, better known as Avril, has been a prominent figure in the music industry for nearly 20 years. She is also an actress best known for her role as Miss B'Have in Shuga: Love, Sex, Money. Formerly signed to Ogopa Deejays, one of Kenya's leading music production and record labels, Avril captivated audiences with singles such as Mama, Kitu Kimoja, Chokoza, and Hakuna Yule. The mother of one studied design at the University of Nairobi but shifted her focus to music during her second year when she recorded her debut single, Mama.

1. When did you discover your acting talent and how did the film industry receive you?I stumbled into acting. So many years ago, producers of Shuga were in Kenya doing auditions and my songs were topping the charts at that time. I approached them and asked if I could have my music in there. MTV's Staying Alive show was a hit at that time, and my dream was to have just one of my songs play on MTV.

I went to the auditions purely to market my music, but as I was auditioning, the producer said there was a musician’s character in the script, and asked if I would like to audition for it. I did and got the role! That marked my entry into acting.

2. You have been absent from the music scene for a while, what have you been up to?I have taken a backseat because of my company (My Everything) and other things that I am focusing on right now.  It is like my small baby. I am nurturing it so I have to give it a lot of attention. My Everything is a company that sells organic cosmetics, which I started a few years ago. I started the company after facing challenges dealing with acne and many other skin conditions. When I started learning about skincare, I got fascinated and decided to explore the field. So far so good.

3. How has motherhood impacted your career? Why don't you post pictures of your child online?My son just turned six and motherhood is a very interesting balancing act. It is not easy. As a mother you are tasked with taking care of life and are responsible for how the child is going to turn out and how they are going to relate with other people. And, there is no manual so you have to learn on the job. My son does not like the limelight and even when you take a photo he will tell you not to post it on social media. I also do not want a conversation after 18 years where my child is asking me why I put his pictures online.

I want that to be his decision. That does not mean he is not on social media, he watches things on YouTube shorts and TikTok and he is living a full life the way he wants. I would love for him to enjoy his childhood like a normal child. If he wants to be in the limelight, I will support him in every way.

4. What achievements are you most proud of? I am surprised by the things I have done in my music career. I have performed as far as Lodwar, Nigeria, and India. I have had such an amazing journey, to be honest. I get emotional thinking about the things I have been able to do, the people I have met, the doors that I have been able to open for myself and other people. Life has been beautiful and I love every bit of it. I chose this path and it has brought so much joy in my life right now and every experience has been so valuable in my life. I want to be remembered as a resilient person. When you are resilient, you know what you want in your life and so you will have the discipline to stay committed.

5. What did you study in school and how do you ensure your brand remains relevant?I have a degree in Product Design from the University of Nairobi. I use it every day in my career as a musician and also for my company. You have to learn how to build your business and how to take your brand to the next level. I thank my parents for educating me because that is the most expensive thing you can ever give your child. I stay relevant by constantly rebranding.

I tell the younger generation to always look at trends, technology and what is happening in the industry they are in. Don't become too comfortable. Always know that there is someone who is looking to get that spot you occupy. If you are not constantly learning and re-learning the industry, you might end up fading. Like right now there is TikTok, do you have the app? We are in the age of AI, are you looking at how you can apply it in your industry? It is always an evolution game and you have to keep on evolving.

Tribulations of experienced teachers employed by TSC as JSS interns,"In 2015, Edna Kamuren from Tenges in Baringo Central left her work as a laboratory technician at Kabarnet Boys High School and enrolled for a Bachelor of Education in Arts at Kisii University.

The motivation behind the decision was to improve her life and that of her three children.

The 40-year-old had earlier graduated with a Diploma from the Eldoret Polytechnic, where she pursued Analytical Chemistry, a course that earned her employment at Kabarnet Boys High School for more than 13 years.

She joined Kisii University, where she studied Kiswahili and Christian Religious Education.

“I was very optimistic that my future would be bright by changing my career, from a laboratory technician to a secondary school tutor, but I didn’t quit my work,” she tells Nation.Africa.

She would report to the school during the day and attend classes in the evening. The salary would go to her school fees, but it was not easy though, she says.

“With all the struggles of work, school, and taking care of my three children, I managed to graduate in 2018,” she says.

Read: TSC to renew contracts for 46,000 interns in January

She continued working as a technician after she applied for jobs at several schools without success until 2022 when the government announced opportunities for junior secondary school teachers, and she gave it a shot. She was elated this would change her life for the better if she got enlisted, she reveals.

Despite applying for employment on permanent and pensionable terms, she received feedback that she had been employed as an intern JSS teacher, which took her aback since some fresh graduates were employed on permanent terms.

She, however, was comforted by the employment letter, which indicated that she would be confirmed after a year.

The year would soon be over, only for the government to fail to honour its promise, meaning she and others in her fate would continue working on internship terms.

She now regrets quitting her well-paying job as a lab technician to pursue teaching.

“The Sh17,000 monthly earnings are inadequate to cater to my needs and my children,"" said Ms Kamuren, who has since withdrawn her three children from a private school for a public school.

Like many other JSS teachers in her shoes, she wonders what criteria were applied to employ recent graduates on Permanent and pensionable terms while denying the experienced teachers the same.

“I am so discouraged because I was looking for ‘greener pasture’ as a secondary school teacher after quitting my job as a lab technician. I had big dreams for my children, and had so much hope in my employer, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), to give me a bright future,” she says.

She had to secure a loan to pay school fees, now deducted from her meagre earnings.

“As a lab technician, I earned more. But I wanted a better future, and I felt I needed to go back to school. I am appealing to the government to just honour its promise and confirm us on permanent employment because we are suffering,” she said.

She reveals that due to the shortage of teachers, some have to teach subjects they never studied in university, implying a workload for the underpaid intern teachers.

Specialised in CRE and Kiswahili

“Though I specialised in CRE and Kiswahili, I teach other subjects that I never studied at the university because of a shortage of teachers. It is very unfair because the workload and roles are shared equally with those on PnP,” she says.

It is the reason intern teachers have been staging protests in the country demanding confirmation on PnP terms.

Joan Toroitich from Karne in Baringo, a mother of two, graduated in 2016 after pursuing a Bachelor of Arts at Mount Kenya University.

She has resorted to doing menial jobs during weekends to make ends meet.

Like Ms Kamuren, she struggled to complete her university education, having come from a humble background.

At some point, she deferred her studies due to school fees challenges. Besides her two children, she has younger siblings looking up to her, all depending on her paltry Sh17,000.

She spends more than Sh250 daily on her bus fare to school, hence her decision to supplement her income through menial work over the weekends.

Read: Why problems in junior secondary are far from over

“Most of those who were employed graduated from the university recently. Why didn’t they consider us who graduated earlier? What criteria was used to employ us as interns because this is very unfair,” she told Nation.Africa.

She, too, points at the understaffing challenge that has presented a heavy workload on JSS teachers, regardless of their employment terms.

“We have two classes, and one has 40 lessons per week, meaning I have eight lessons per day. There is no time to rest, we work from morning to evening,” she states. I am supposed to teach English and Literature, but I have to take other subjects too, which I didn’t study in university because there is a shortage of teachers,” she notes.

“Such a workload and so little pay is very demoralising,” she states.

During protests in Kabarnet Town last week, JSS intern teacher Nicholas Keror took issue with TSC’s argument that the internship programme was meant to equip them with skills and experience.

“What experience do they want us to have when some of us here graduated in 2015 and have been teaching since then in several schools under the Board of Management? We have served as intern teachers for junior secondary for one and half years and we want the government to honour its promise and employ us on permanent terms. You cannot promise us heaven and deliver hell,” he protested.

Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Baringo branch executive secretary Zacharia Nyomboi said JSS intern teachers have gone through challenges, with some unable to cater to their families.

“What type of internship is this, and yet you have given the same job to someone who graduated a year ago? Where is the fairness here?” posed Nyomboi.

Kuppet has asked the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (KUPPET) to investigate TSC and release a report on how many teachers have been employed in the last two years permanently.

He took issue with Members of Parliament for staying silent on the matter.

“They (legislators) are silent yet they are aware that JSS children in public schools are not learning. It is not business as usual unless the government is ready to waste a generation. The government must fund TSC to employ JSS teachers on permanent and pensionable terms,” added Nyomboi.

Mungai's lungs of steel that earn him a decent living,"To say Simon Mungai has lungs of steel would be to exaggerate the power he packs in his chest. However, that might be the best way to illustrate his prowess with an instrument capable of leaving anyone breathless — the trombone.

As illustrated recently in a video that went viral of a policeman passionately playing the brass instrument, operating a trombone is no child's play. But once one gets hooked, Simon says, it is a fun ride.

He is a third-year student of medicine at the University of Nairobi, and learnt to play the instrument at the Safaricom Youth Orchestra. He joined the orchestra in 2014 and graduated in 2020.

Today, Korogocho-born Simon juggles between studying, playing in church, performing, and teaching music. Teaching brings him an income while medicine, in his own words, is “delayed gratification” that will bring an income later.

The trombone instrument must require a lot of energy to play…Yes. You have to eat well, exercise, and do lots of swimming to increase your lung capacity because you have to hold your breath for long periods.

Have you got your own trombone? I read that at some point you were getting one from Ghetto Classics…Yes, I have one trombone currently. It’s called a Holton. It is a privilege to have one because they are quite expensive. They cost about Sh100,000, so getting one is an achievement.

How are your studies going?I am a third-year student at the University of Nairobi. I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree.

That means you are putting in a lot of effort because medicine isn’t easy…I couldn’t say it’s hard. The only problem is that there is humongous content to be retained. But if you’re a bookworm, it becomes quite easy and enjoyable too. You know, it’s like solving puzzles. Sometimes it’s so beautiful. But sometimes it can be, let’s say, too much to handle, especially when you’re also engaged in other extracurricular activities like music and other stuff like teaching. It can be a lot.

By the time you graduate, you will be a qualified trombonist with a degree in medicine, how do you plan to use the two skills? To be honest, I’m planning to practice medicine. I really look forward to being a doctor and furthering my education to a Master’s, and sub-specialise in surgery. But also I’m a passionate musician. When I finished Form Four, I had a hard time choosing between going to medical school or going to music school. But over time, I’ve come to realise these things are doable; they intermarry. You can do one while also pursuing the other. So, I have no intentions of dropping music anytime soon because at least for now, music is paying my bills.

You say music pays your bills…how?I’m lucky to be earning from both teaching and playing music. And I’ve had the privilege to gig with some of Kenya’s finest musicians like McKinley from NHP. Currently, I’m working with Eddie Grey. I’ve worked with Sanaipei (Tande), and I’m also currently playing for Wyre.

Is it the training you got at the Safaricom Youth Orchestra that you are imparting on your learners?Most of my foundation started at SYO (Safaricom Youth Orchestra). I learnt a lot of stuff. Apart from music, I also learnt a lot of leadership skills, because most of the time I was the section leader, and also the principal trombonist. In layman's terms, that means you’re in charge of your section. You have to be a good leader to manage your section, to make sure everybody is up to speed with the music we are playing. So, SYO has really impacted me well, positively with leadership skills, with my playing, with all the knowledge I have.

You’re also a conductor?Yes, I do conduct at Ghetto Classics. I’m an assistant conductor. I usually help our music director, Mr Eric. I also take conducting classes online from The Juilliard School. Juilliard is like the Harvard of music. It is a number one musical school based in New York.

Can a trombone player perform solo or you have to be part of a band?People are used to seeing trombones as a backup instrument, but it can actually be a solo instrument. It blends well with other instruments and it can also take the lead.

Kenyans are used to seeing brass instruments only with police bands and in some churches…You know, it’s a culture thing. Apart from police bands, things like orchestras are viewed as Western ideas. But with time, people have come to accept it as part of our culture. I have seen the emergence of such wonderful orchestras like the Ghetto Classic Orchestra, the Kenya National Youth Orchestra, and the mighty Nairobi Orchestra. The Nairobi Orchestra, for instance, sells out all its concerts, meaning it’s a culture people are starting to adopt. However, we still have lots of myths, like the belief that orchestral music is only for the rich. Yes, the tickets are quite pricey, but the music is so enjoyable. It’s something out of the ordinary…music you haven’t ever heard. And I think it’s so nice. I think with emerging orchestras and concerts every season, slowly by slowly people are coming to adapt to it. I think classical music is here to stay.

As a medicine student and a musician, what does your week look like?I have a pretty ugly timetable. I usually have classes from Monday to Friday, from morning to evening. In the evenings, I sometimes have concerts or practice sessions. On weekends, I do music full-time. In the morning I go to Mukuru to teach music. I then rush from Mukuru to church, and do a quick sound check in preparation for Sunday service. Then I leave church and go to Ghetto Classics, Korogocho, do another session till 4pm and then I go home, and prepare for Sunday. On Sunday, I have to wake up really early, go to church and stay there until 2pm. Thereafter I go to Ghetto Classics, teach and conduct until 5pm, and then I go back home, then the cycle continues.

What does it take to be a good orchestra player and a trombonist?You need to have the passion, and to enrol in a class to learn how to play. You also have to be a daring person because it is a very, very powerful instrument with a very, very brilliant, mellow, wonderful sound. It is not an instrument for many people, because it requires one to blow a lot of air. Some people see it as very heavy. Others think the sound is too loud for them, so to play it well you have to be daring.

Student of business who brought African Esports title home,"How did it feel to be crowned the African Esports champion?It was so amazing to win, especially since the player I fought in the final was someone I had played and lost to online before. In the lead-up to the African Championship, I was practicing a lot since I knew he would be my main challenger.

I really practiced hard and worked on my weaknesses. Beating him to win the tournament was a very big achievement for me. I’m very happy. Part of me did not believe it, but it was reality. It was a happiness I hadn’t felt in a long time. My opponent shook my hands after the match and congratulated me. It felt very nice. After the tournament, we played more matches just for fun.

What does it take to be an African champion?Commitment, and a lot of practice hours. It is not easy. In Africa, it is even more difficult because the online infrastructure is not very developed. We have a lot of issues in Africa such as random blackouts and occasional internet outages, so there are a lot of things that make it challenging to grow in this sport.

You have to fight through all of those hardships. Most of my training is done online because offline, there are not many players locally, so I’m forced to play online players from Southern African countries and from the Middle East. The Middle East has so many talented and experienced players. They also have a proper Esports team, so I play a lot of their players. Luckily, Kenya is located in a good spot geographically to play with opponents from different countries online.

How did you defeat such experienced opponents?I knew about the tournament two months in advance, so I spent the first month practicing hard for it. I had a rough idea of the opponents I would be facing because the African Esports scene is not that big. I know all the top players in the continent. I prepared with my opponents in mind.

I watched videos of them playing so that I could know what to expect in terms of their playing styles because each player plays differently. I prepared a strategy for each of them. On the day of the tournament, I focused only on my matches and my strategies, and it worked!

Let’s go back to where your Esports journey started...It started in 2019. I used to play a game called Call of Duty as well as other single-player games just for fun. Then I stumbled upon a video on YouTube about fighting games, which inspired me. In the clip, there was a very exciting match between Japanese player Daigo Umehara and American player Justin Wong. There were so many spectators who were cheering wildly. I remember wishing I could be part of the game. I was fascinated. After that I began playing Mortal Kombat 11 to sharpen my skills.

What was your first year in Esports like?It wasn’t good at all. I had to buy the basic equipment. Then in 2020 I began taking on Kenyan opponents. I lost many times because they were much more skilled than I was. I also played opponents online from Zambia and South Africa, and lost to them. But with time, I got better. I started winning tournaments online against South African and Zambian players and from there I was hooked.

Roughly, how many hours do you put into training?It depends. If a tournament is coming up, I put more hours into training. For example, before heading to Nigeria, I trained for three to four hours every day. But, normally I don’t put in that many hours because we don’t have tournaments that often. Mostly we have only one major tournament in a year.

Who is your role model in Esports?It is the person who got me into the fighting games – Daigo Umehara. He is the reason I’m playing today. He is still playing and doing well in the sport. I like him because he is a legend in the fighting games. That parry he did against Wong got me into this sport. Outside Esports, I look up to former professional boxer Muhammad Ali and basketball player Michael Jordan. They were so dominant in their disciplines, and I would like to achieve that someday.

Johnathan McKinstry: I’ve no regrets taking Gor job,"Irish coach Johnathan McKinstry is leaving Gor Mahia after a very successful season, opting not to extend his contract but seek a new challenge.

He doesn’t regret taking the job in July 2022 and leading the Kenyan giants to an unprecedented 21st league title despite being discouraged two years ago by other tacticians not to take this well-known hot job.

In a lengthy interview with Gor Mahia Media this week the out-going coach said he will miss the team and will be watching closely how they perform in the CAF Champions League.

But his work in Kenya is not yet finished, he reckons, and hopes to come back one day.

McKinstry will be leaving Gor Mahia after their last league game of the season versus Bidco United on June 23 even though his two-year contract with the club ends in September to take a new job as coach of Gambia. He has bagged two FKF-PL titles with K’Ogalo.

Many challenges

The Football Kenya Federation Premier League winner was officially announced as the new coach of the Gambia on Wednesday in Banjul.

Interestingly, Gambia are in the same 2026 World Cup qualifying Group ""F"" with Kenya. The Gambians play Seychelles and Gabon on June 8 and June 11 respectively.

“I’m leaving this club because I got a better offer,” he revealed

“I was discouraged from taking this job because of the many challenges then but this success makes me not regret my decision,” said McKinstry.

The full interview will be aired on Gor Mahia’s social media site this week.

“I know the club wants someone who will take what we have started growing and build it. We have the fourth youngest squad in the league and whoever comes in should guide and teach these players so that they can perform well in the CAF Champions League,” he added.

“Working with this young team was fantastic and the new coach should be embraced. The team is well set up and the ideas of my successor, I’m optimistic, will help them make another history of qualifying for at least the group stage of the CAF Champions League,” said McKinstry, who formerly Uganda, Rwanda and Sierra Leone.

He said the incoming coach shouldn’t be judged by his performance but should be allowed to bring his system of play to better the club. After the next round of World Cup qualifiers in June, McKinstry will briefly return to Kenya for Gor Mahia’s coronation at Raila Odinga on June 19 when they face FC Talanta.

Bid the club farewell

He will officially bid the club farewell after the close the season against Bidco United at a venue yet to be confirmed.



He never had it easy at Gor Mahia with die-hard fans expressing their dissatisfaction with slim wins he secured and what they claimed was a “lack of clear playing philosophy.”

He said that winning was what mattered and he has delivered the Kenyan title.

But he says what is key to him is winning games because that is what football demands.

Who will take over at K’Ogalo?

Gor Mahia Secretary Sam Ochola said in a statement they will be looking for an internationally accomplished coach with CAF Champions League group stage experienced.

Ochola added that the coach must be new in Kenya, a clear response to rumours that former AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems was being considered for the big seat.

The official added that the coach must also have bagged titles with the national team and club he has worked for.

McKinstry joins a long list of Gor Mahia coaches who have left as reigning league champions.

Coach Engin Firat: Why we chose Malawi for Harambee Stars’ home ties,"Harambee Stars coach Engin Firat has said the team’s recent impressive performance at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe was what influenced the decision to take Kenya's two upcoming home Group “F” World Cup qualifiers to the Malawian venue.

Stars are scheduled to host Burundi on June 7 before welcoming reigning African champions Côte d’Ivoire on June 11 in the southern African nation.

Football Kenya Federation (FKF) were forced to seek an alternative venue for the World Cup qualifiers, owing to the lack of a stadium that meets Fifa standards in Kenya.

Addressing the press yesterday at Police Sacco Stadium in Nairobi, Firat said they settled on Bingu National Stadium following the Stars' triumph in the Four Nation tournament held at the venue in March.

Kenya hammered Malawi 4-0 before thumping Zimbabwe 3-1 in the final to win the friendly tournament on Match 26.

He added that the team’s familiarity with the facilities in Lilongwe and the hospitality of the Malawians also led to their decision to play the matches in Lilongwe.

Good memories

“We have some positive impact there and good memories about Malawi. We know the stadium and training fields plus the people there were kind to us. They hosted us very well,” said Firat.

He said they did not go for the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania since the Tanzania national team will be hosting their home matches at the facility while Burundi also enjoys a big fan base in that country.

Firat said they did consider the Mandela National Stadium in Uganda since it received late approval to host international matches.

Firat said that while playing their home matches in a foreign country was a big disadvantage, they would strive to register a positive result.

“The reality in the football world is that no team has ever been successful by playing all the time away. You need the home support and the feeling that you are at home. All this is missing for us, making the job more difficult for us but we will try to do our best,” said the Turk.

He warned that Kenyan football will never progress if there are no proper football infrastructures in the country.

Two matches

Firat said that he will travel for the two matches with a maximum of 25 players. The team is expected to jet out of the country on June 2 with foreign-based striker Michael Olunga, midfielder Richard Odada, and defender Daniel Anyembe linking up with their national mates in Malawi.

The Stars coach said that he could miss the services of five players due to injury and passport issues. While defender Joseph Okumu is expected to join the camp today, Firat said he is a serious doubt.



He was also not sure if defender Eric Ouma would be available for the match since he is also injured.

But he said he has a big pool to choose players from.

“When I started, it was very simple for me to name 24 players but now I have a headache to be honest. We have created so many players that I will have problems leaving some players out which was not my intention,” he said.

Gabon, Gambia, and Seychelles are the other teams in Group “F”.

Kenya lie third in the group with one win and one loss. They lost 2-1 to Gabon before routing Seychelles 5-0 in November.

Limuru III conference lacked a real agenda,"‘Limuru Zero’ • The recent “so-called Limuru III conference did not have any real substance for the Mount Kenya region as it lacked a real agenda”, says Joseph Macharia. This, he believes, explains why the Who is Who from the region gave the event a wide berth. “The first two such gatherings achieved a lot and left indelible marks on the politics of the Mountain region.” His contact is [email protected].

Traffic rules • Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen should do more to stop the deaths on the road, says David Kiengo. The minister, adds David, should have traffic rules and regulations enforced. “He should not rely on traffic police, who are easily compromised to let drivers of unroadworthy vehicles pass.” He challenges the CS to go out incognito and witness it first-hand. His contact [email protected].

Warmongering • Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga’s rant about a supposed plot against Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua was uncalled for, says Lincoln E. Oyigo. “Leaders should style up. Someone of your calibre shouldn’t be issuing threats such as ‘Kama mbaya, mbaya (It’s an all-out war)’. Let’s promote peace. The 50 million Kenyans need food, not rhetoric.” His contact is [email protected].

Air safety • The aviation school at Nairobi’s busy Wilson Airport should be relocated to a place where there is less air traffic, Joseph Tagaya proposes. “It poses a grave risk to the aviators, staff and passengers.” He hopes the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) will act promptly to minimise the risk of aircraft crashes and enhance safety in this city neighbourhood. His contact is [email protected].

***

‘Isiolo City’ • Nairobi’s crippling problems are because it’s both the political and commercial capital, says David Kilonzo. “Other African countries have separated the two. Burundi has Gitega and Bujumbura, Malawi Lilongwe and Blantyre, Tanzania Dar es Salaam and Dodoma, and Nigeria Lagos and Abuja. Kenya should develop Isiolo as its political or financial capital.” His contact is [email protected].

"Quail, okra, and other ‘pyramid schemes’ and how you can make quick money","A couple of years ago, I visited a relative in the village, where I was served meat I had never eaten before – quail meat. And not just pieces of it, a basin full of whole fried quail.

I was amazed and taken aback at the same time, since at that moment, I had no idea what I had just been served since what I was seeing was too small to be chicken. Understandably, I was nervous.

Fortunately this relative and I are close, so I immediately showed my trepidation and asked her why she was serving us what looked like “small birds”, and whether she was sure they were edible. It is then that she went ahead to explain that what I was looking at was quail.

It turned out that she had joined the quail ‘super business’ bandwagon, but had made the mistake of joining late and had ended up losing close to a million shillings. A row of cages in her backyard was full of the birds, she told me, and since the market was saturated, she had no market to sell to, and could no longer afford to feed the birds, which explained why she had resorted to eating them.

But she wasn’t alone in this predicament, she informed me that one of her frustrated neighbour’s, who had also kept the birds, had opened her cages the previous day and allowed them to fly away.

“We decided to eat ours,” she said.

I searched the words “quail meat”, and the pictures that came up are of plump birds that look like chicken when slaughtered, a far cry from what I was served that day. You see, my relative could not afford to feed hers, so they had wasted away, and were more bones than meat. I could not help empathising with her, as I gamely nibbled the non-existent meat.

This incident came to mind after the conversation about okra water began to gather pace. Suddenly, all the women of Kenya, especially those who had never heard of this vegetable, (or fruit if you asked a scientist) was asking where they could get it so that they could experience its ‘goodness’.

As you can imagine mama mbogas and hawkers have been making a killing, having hiked the usual price of the newest craze in town.

I’d also imagine that there is a Kenyan somewhere that has leased land to plant this vegetable. By the way, Okra is also widely known as lady’s finger, so some of you might have been eating it for years because it is widely available and has always been.

Anyway, this okra water talk reminded me of the pyramid scheme that was the quail business and how hundreds of Kenyans, including my relative, burned their fingers after investing in it long after of the ‘early bloomers’ had made millions and quit the business. Remember the dragon fruit?

The fact is that a big number of Kenyans are always more than willing to jump into the bandwagon, most probably due to the fear of missing out, and herein lies the pathway to richness.

I have realised that if you want to make crazy money in this town, all you have to do is go on social media and extol the values, real or imagined, of a product and ensure that you have lots of it in stock. But not just any product, it has to be one that promises enhanced beauty or enhanced health. Then sit back and watch the money start rolling in.

Rhino Charge: Conservationists aim to raise over Sh173m on Madaraka weekend,"Conservationists are hoping to surpass the Sh173 million raised last year during this year's Rhino Charge to be held in Kajiado County during the Madaraka Day weekend.

Kajiado has been chosen to host the 35th edition of the Rhino Charge.

Nkoteyia Community Conservancy in Ewaso Nyiro landscape in Samburu County hosted the 34th edition of the event, which raised Sh173 million for the completion of the 61km section of the Mt Kenya electric fence in Nyeri County, the construction of the Kakamega Forest electric fence, the maintenance of the 758km Aberdare Mt Kenya, Eburu and Kakamega electric fence, the extension of community patrol teams to south-western Mau, and the construction of the Kakamega Forest electric fence.

The Rhino Charge is not only a world-renowned 4x4 off-road competition, but it is also one of the few sporting events with a national conservation purpose.

It is run to help protect the integrity and ecological functions of Kenya's mountain forests, also known as water towers, as they are the source of all the country's major rivers.

Since its inception in 1989, the Rhino Charge has raised Sh2.1 billion for the conservation of Mt Kenya, the Aberdares, South Western Mau and Mount Eburu in the Mau Forest Complex and Kakamega Forest.

While the first Rhino Charge raised only Sh250,000, the amount has grown tremendously over the years, crossing the Sh180 million mark in 2018 thanks to local and international supporters.

World's longest game fences

Projects funded by Rhino Charge include the construction of the world's longest game fences, such as the 450km Mount Kenya Electric Fence, 300km of which has already been constructed.

The funds have also been used to maintain the completed 400km Aberdare electric fence and the 43.3km electric fence around Mount Eburu, as well as the ongoing fencing of Kakamega Forest in Western Kenya.

Don White, the event's Clerk of Course, has since announced the location of the 2024 Rhino Charge route notes.

The much-anticipated route notes to the actual venue, which will remain secret, will not be released to competing vehicles, sponsors and spectators until a few days before the event.

Rhino Ark executive director, Christian Lambrechts Christian, said the organisation had carried out activities in Mt Kenya, Mau Eburu, Aberdares, South Western Mau and Kakamega Fores in the past year.

Scrutineering for this year's Rhino Charge will take place on May 31 ahead of the event on June 1. The prize-giving ceremony will take place on June 2.

The organisation of the Rhino Charge is supported by in-kind contributions from the private sector including some of Kenya's largest companies such as Total Energies, Safaricom, AutoXpress, Tarpo, White Cap, Castor Vali, Rotor Jet Aviation, Z Boskovic Air Charters, Sandstorm, Mantech Inflight Systems, Aquamist, The Iceman, Tropical Heat, Papyrus, Northscape, Rivercross Tracking Ltd, Instarect, Chloride Exide and Bins.

The economic burden of endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain in Kenya,"Every month that 40-year-old Rosemary Mwaniki gets her menses, she spends Sh16,000 on pain relief medicines to treat cramps.

This is money for a doctor's consultation in a Nairobi top hospital; after being rushed to the emergency room, four types of painkillers are given through the vein for quick relief, and more oral medicines to take for two to three days until the muscles in her uterus calm down.

Besides the Sh16,000, she says she had spent close to Sh1 million treating a disease that so many gynaecologists and surgeons missed, endometriosis, an illness in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.

""Do you know why it has been this expensive?"" She asks.

""No doctor ever told me I had endometriosis. They kept treating me for useless things like fibroids, which every woman has, then I end up spending Sh16,000 every month because I'm always in this unexplainable pain. They never take time to think away from certain diagnoses. I had all the signs of endometriosis. They could have asked me this, 'How short is your menstrual cycle? Is there pain in your right leg?' Then they think what else could be the reason for my monthly pain and unexplained infertility,"" she says.

""I once asked a doctor if he goes home and thinks about each patient that he has seen. He sees 50 women a day with different complications, he has his family and his life, what time will he have to wonder what I have and why I am not getting better?""

Rosemary's endometriosis has progressed to Stage 4, a more severe form of this disease, where it has spread to one ovary and right leg.

Sophie Richards (who sought anonymity because she is undergoing another surgery soon) says she has had several surgeries and countless treatments for endometriosis management. The disease has no lasting treatment, so the costs keep piling up as she strives to lead a pain-free life.

Sophie tells the BDLife that she was not aware that she was suffering from endometriosis until it was accidentally discovered during surgery.

“The surgery cost me about Sh550,000, although it was not endometrial surgery. I'm supposed to have another endometrium surgery, but I am afraid to have it done,"" she says.

How it presents

Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows around the organs in the abdomen. The uterus has three layers; the inner lining is the one that's shed every month when a woman menstruates, called endometrium.

In the majority of cases, the experts say that you will find this tissue growing in the pelvic area. Endometriosis can also grow in any other part of the body; they have seen it in the eye and ear as well. Similarly, it can invade different organs, most commonly the large intestine. If this tissue infiltrates the uterine wall, it is adenomyosis; if it infiltrates the ovary, it is endometrioma.

Part of Sophie's monthly bill is the cost of buying hormonal contraceptives to manage her painful menses and the spotting in between her monthly periods.

""Currently, I am taking the pills for 21 days per month until I undergo the surgery on my intestine and uterus, which I guess are all coiled together because of the endometriosis, which is at stage four. My fallopian tubes are also blocked, so I will need surgery to correct all that mess,"" she adds.

Dr Joe Njagi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist specialising in the excision of endometriosis, says endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent condition that progresses when the ovaries have been activated after the start of the menstrual cycle.

""Endometriosis can be detected before the start of menses and the end of menses (menopause). My youngest patient was 15 years old. It can start early and go on until post-menopause. It doesn't necessarily depend on when women start their menstrual cycle to detect it,"" he says.

The cause of endometrium is not known, which is why it may be difficult to manage; it is considered an enigmatic disease. Experts say research has shown that foetuses not yet born have been found with traces of endometrial tissue.

""Because we don't know how it develops, early diagnosis is very important. Then we can manage it and slow it down to a point where it doesn't affect the woman's quality of life and fertility,"" the doctor says.

Is there a relation between endometriosis and fibroids?

""There has not been any established relationship between fibroids and endometriosis. What fibroids have been confused with is adenomyosis [a painful condition in which endometrial tissue exists within and grows into the uterine wall] because fibroids grow on the wall of the uterus. But the symptoms are different,"" Dr Njagi adds.

Symptoms and diagnosis

What symptoms, then, are suggestive of endometriosis?

""Women who have pelvic pains, pain in the lower abdominal region, cyclic pain (dysmenorrhea)—in fact, 80 percent of women who experience very painful menses could be suffering endometriosis, pain during sexual intercourse, pain while passing stool, heavy bleeding, and women who would present with depression and bowel symptoms,"" Dr Njagi says.

The diagnosis should be made by a specialist who has the skills to perform endometriosis imaging. But they are very few in Kenya.

""Unfortunately, we see women who come in too late when the condition is worse; they will have these symptoms for up to 10 years,"" says Dr Njagi.

""The first line of imaging is an ultrasound scan, which is usually transvaginal and gets close to the uterus, and we can look for changes that are suggestive of endometriosis. You will be able to tell if there is endometriosis and the severity of the disease. Another imaging technique is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We can also optimise and do a periscope, which is a minimally invasive procedure where you put a camera in the abdomen which can be used to look around, especially for early disease,"" he adds.

If the scan does not reveal traces of endometriosis, it does not mean the patient is clear of the disease; they could be having the early disease (superficial disease), which is a very tiny growth that can cause severe symptoms.

""It is also true to say the patient's symptoms, mostly pain, are not directly correlated to the severity of the disease. Some have the early disease but have severe pain; others have the advanced disease yet have settled symptoms,"" he says.

However, Dr Njagi adds,""If after diagnosis, there is nothing and you still have the symptoms, we need to rule out any other condition that can cause pelvic pain. Some of the conditions that can cause pain are nerve problems, neuropathic pain and myalgia. We will start the patient on treatment for endometriosis, and if she does not respond to the treatment, we will then conduct laparoscopy.""

How it affects fertility

The scans can be performed during or after your menses.

Does it affect fertility?

""We have cases where women seek treatment not directly because they have symptoms of endometriosis, but because they have been trying to conceive for some time and have not been able to do so until they find out that they have endometriosis. However, you have a chance of conceiving if you have endometriosis. We have to establish the significance of how much fertility has been affected. It's only a matter of when the condition was detected, which will make a significant improvement in the level of natural conception,"" Dr Njagi explains.

Sh5 million treatment

The treatment for endometriosis often involves medicine or surgery. Dr Njagi tells the BDLife that there is no medical cure for endometriosis. For the medical treatment, he says they prescribe painkillers and hormonal treatment, but if the patient does not respond, they opt for an excision.

For instance, Rosemary has had surgeries—not the excision of endometriotic lesions or nodules, but fibroids removal, ovary excision and others, which gave her relief for a year, then the pain came back. Now every month she has to take opioid painkillers and anti-nausea drugs as she mulls doing the excision surgery.

""Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, surgery would cost from Sh400,000 to Sh1.5 million. For the follow-up medical treatment like physiotherapy, the patient might need medical counselling, hormonal suppression medication, and, in the worst case, protective ileostomies, making the entire treatment and surgery cost as much as Sh5 million,"" says Dr Njagi.

Court throws out appeal of sex pest who was jailed for 330 years,"In 2021, David Karega Njau was sentenced to 330 years in prison for defiling five school girls aged between three and six years.

Believing the punishment to be excessive, he decided to appeal.

However, the High Court on May 21 upheld the sentence, deeming it commensurate with the severity of his offenses.

Court documents revealed that Karega would waylay the girls as they returned from school, luring them to his house with money or sweets.

Once there, he gave them alcohol before defiling them in turns. The crimes occurred in Nakuru’s Rigogo village in Rongai Sub-county between September 10 and September 19, 2019.

Karega threatened the girls with death if they disclosed what had happened.

The terrified children initially kept silent. However, one girl confided in her grandmother after the pain became unbearable. The grandmother notified a neighbour, who in turn contacted the police, leading to Karega's arrest.

The girls’ parents discovered the abuse after their children complained of pain while urinating and bathing.

In court, one girl described how Karega hid in a maize plantation, gave them money, and took them to his house.

She said he made them lie on a couch, gave them alcohol, and forced them to drink from a bottle he had urinated in.

He would then cover their mouths to prevent them from screaming and then defiled them one by one. The girl, who lived with her grandmother, disclosed the abuse after enduring two consecutive days of defilement.

Medical examinations by Dr Njoroge Luka confirmed that three of the girls had been defiled, while there were attempts on two others.

In his defence, Karega claimed he was at his grandmother’s burial at the time and alleged that the children’s parents had framed him due to personal grudges and unpaid debts.

Principal Magistrate Rhoda Yator, in her ruling delivered on March2, 2021, found Karega guilty and sentenced him to 100 years imprisonment for each of the three counts of defilement and 10 years for each of the three counts of committing an indecent act with a child.

Karega filed an appeal on March 10 complaining that the punishment was harsh and severe and failed to take into account the age and the circumstances surrounding the offence.

But on May 21, Nakuru High Court judge Samuel Mohochi dismissed Karega’s appeal and found the deterrent punishment commensurate with the magnitude of the offense.

“The appellant subjected the five minors all under the age of seven years to a bizarre and inhuman sexual attack. The orgy of sexual violence and threats of physical harm against the five children resulted in serious permanent trauma scars for which they shall remain, for the rest of their lives. In this case justice can only be served by a deterrent imprisonment term,” Justice Mohochi ruled. The sentences will, however, run concurrently.

Fai Amario estate dispute: 'Son' surfaces following newspaper wife search Ad,"The inheritance battle over the Sh760 million estate of the late controversial Naivasha-based brewer, Fai Amario, has taken a new twist after a man claiming to be his son moved to court seeking to be included as a beneficiary.

Mr Evans Karee, 33, alleges that he is the biological son of the late businessman and has filed an application in court seeking what he believes is his rightful inheritance.

Mr Karee stated that his late father was polygamous and had married his deceased mother, Penninah Shinta, after placing an advertisement in the local dailies searching for a wife.

This development comes just four months after the 14-year succession dispute appeared to be headed for a conclusion.

On January 31, Nakuru High Court judge, Samuel Mohochi, distributed part of the estate worth Sh56 million among 10 beneficiaries and allowed the administrators to confirm the remaining estate based on consent signed by nine beneficiaries.

The 10 beneficiaries included Amario's children Marsha Dee, Miki Ng’ang’a, Bernice Njeri, Debbie Jolly, James Kimani, Sheena Euston, Yuri Gilbert, Sheila Wangari, a minor, and Salome Wanjiku.

Ms Wanjiku, who was a girlfriend to the tycoon, was allocated 5 percent of the Sh56 million.

But Mr Karee is seeking the revocation of the grant of letters of administration issued to Amario's children Dee, Ng'ang’a, and Euston, on September 23, 2010.

He claims these administrators excluded him by deliberately concealing material facts about his existence, and he only discovered the case had been filed later in January.

He presented the court with a newspaper report proving that Amario married Shinta in Nakuru on September 11, 1999. He further alleges that his step-siblings were aware of his existence, but chose to conceal it from the courts when they filed the case in 2010.

“The administrators are aware I exist. They knew my mother. They never informed me of the proceedings and the case was filed in 2010, while I was still in High School,” stated Mr Karee in his court papers.

He now wants the court to stop the distribution of the estate until his application, in which he seeks to be recognised as a family member, is heard and determined.

“The planned distribution of the estate will be prejudicial to me since it will disinherit me from my rightful dues, thus violating my rights,” he said.

Justice Mohochi directed Mr Karee to serve the application within seven days, which should be replied to within 14 days, before giving further directions on July 9.

Fai Amario, a wealthy tycoon who died in 2010, was among the first major suppliers of affordable liquor and founded one of the indigenous alcohol distillers, Fai Amarillo Ltd.

His life was marked by controversy and frequent clashes with authorities.

Popular brands produced by his factory included Amario’s Sherry, Pooler, Medusa, Uhuru 2000, Kata Pingu, Mahewa, and Cantata, which were distributed via depots in Meru, Murang’a, Thika, and Naivasha.

In 2021, Ms Dee informed the court that the company generated Sh28 million every four months.

The estate's distribution has been contentious, with Mr Ng’ang’a and Ms Dee disputing over beneficiaries. While Ng’ang’a wanted all 10 to benefit, Dee sought to exclude Wanjiku and Wangari, arguing they were not rightful beneficiaries.

According to the consent signed in court, Ng’ang’a, Dee, Njeri, Jolly, Kimani, Euston, and Yuri were each allocated 11.85 percent of the estate, the minor 6.05 percent, Wanjiku 5 percent, and Wangari 6 percent.

The family proposed selling the properties located in Mwichiringiri, Naivasha, for Sh56 million.

Fintech start-up redefining digital financial services in Africa,"Huge demand and growth for digital wallets in Africa, especially in Kenya, and with no one building the infrastructure for these wallets so that customers do not have to build them themselves, gave a duo a business idea.

They established Terra Softworks Limited, a fintech start-up that serves to empower African businesses by aggregating financial services, in one platform dubbed Wallet as a Service (WaaS.

Terra was founded in 2012 while the founders were still enrolled at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat). Their goal was to leverage their course-related talents to create solutions for Africa.

“Since its inception, Terra has evolved. We were initially a software development-focused technology company. Throughout East Africa, we developed software solutions for governments, financial institutions and non-profit organisations. Around 2014, we changed our focus to payment platforms and created a payment gateway called SwypePay,” according to co-founder Muriuki.

SwypePay was a payment processing platform that enabled merchants and businesses to make payments and receive payments across East Africa. But this was short-lived as everything went crushing during the Covid-19 pandemic period.

Digital wallets

The founders, Collins Muriuki, 33, and Martin Nyaga, 34, saw an opportunity to apply their in-depth expertise in contactless payments, specifically Tap & Pay, to address an issue and brought Terra 2.0 back to life as Africa’s digital wallet infrastructure.

Terra, is a comprehensive platform for businesses to create and manage digital wallets for their customers easily and empowers African businesses with fast, seamless and all-encompassing digital solutions.

Mr Muriuki says Terra is committed to fostering digital ecosystems across Africa and assisting businesses in thriving on a single, integrated platform.

It is aimed to accelerate growth and realise financial objectives by simplifying and enhancing complex processes. Although he admits that it was not easy.

Mr Muriuki, who also studied Accounting and Finance at Strathmore University, says that he developed a liking for technology from a young age from watching his brother open up, fix and do upgrades on their old computer and he found that fascinating.

He notes that he started the company with an initial capital of Sh20,000 loaned to them by his father. As collateral and a way for them to repay the debt, they sold a Samsung Galaxy Tablet that his co-founder Mr Nyaga had won from a gaming challenge.

“We have impressively grown a 100 per cent boot-strapped company into a profitable African venture, securing significant contracts with impact. Terra is redefining digital financial services in Africa,” he says.



About five nations are supported by the company’s WaaS platform, which has facilitated close to 40 million transactions through the platforms’ infrastructure. This accomplishment is especially notable in the highly competitive tech start-up scene, as obtaining outside money is frequently regarded as essential to expansion.

“We are a B2B business, our clientele ranges from SMEs to well-established businesses that need digital solutions to help streamline their processes and make them more effective. In most cases, our customers, will leverage our wallets to make some complex tasks, simple and efficient, while unlocking growth opportunities in Africa,” says Mr Muriuki.

Terra has had a wide variety of clients; from non-profit organisations, Ed-tech organisations, governments, financial services providers, enterprises among others.

Through the use of wallet-ready smart farmer cards, he led the development of a smart card based tea traceability platform by the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA).

Mobile money

“In addition to giving farmers a sense of security and empowerment, this platform makes sure that tea can be tracked easily from the farm to the factories. It also creates chances for layering and offering digital financial services to all Kenyan tea growers on the same card and wallet infrastructure,” he says.

In their other project, Food4Education School Feeding Programme, Terra co-developed, launched and scaled Tap2Eat, a digital mobile platform that uses cutting-edge Fin-tech to enable public primary school children to access nutritious food for education.

Parents pay for the subsidised lunch using mobile money. The amount is credited to a virtual wallet linked to a smart wrist band which students Tap2Eat in under five seconds. Terra has worked with Cup of Uji for their cashless school feeding programme.

“To give tools and automation with our digital wallets, we collaborate closely with partners in the fields of education, agriculture and healthcare. We have partnerships with businesses worldwide including Motorola, Famoco, Ulefone, Google and more,” he states.

Regarding accreditation, he says that they are presently working to obtain a license from the Central Bank of Kenya to license Terra as a provider of payment services.



WaaS, Mr Muriuki says enables anyone in Africa to create, manage and deploy digital wallets without having to invest time or money in building them. Usage-based pricing begins at $150 (Sh20,000) for startups, and users can take advantage of a 30-day free trial after registering on the company’s website.

25 financial services

Mr Muriuki says the ability of WaaS to aggregate more than 25 financial services, including digital wallets, onto a single platform is what distinguishes it from the competition.

He asserts that their strategy has been multidimensional, firmly anchored in innovation, strategic alliances, consumer insight and persistence despite the competitive landscape.

“Our value offer is around the smooth incorporation of state-of-the-art technology into financial services, with practical applications that cater to the changing requirements of both consumers and businesses. Our platform offers unparalleled customisation,” he states.

By using no-code tools, they streamline complex processes, enabling one to focus on growing their business and achieving their vision in the ever-evolving.

Whether it’s for a small start-up or a large enterprise, Terra’s solution is designed to scale and evolve in alignment with their client’s growth trajectories.

Currently having a team of over 20 full time, remote employees and consultants, Mr Muriuki says that their goal is to see Terra grow into a pan-African company and we go above and beyond to turn this dream and goals into reality.

Biggest hurdle

“The Covid-19 pandemic has been the biggest hurdle we have had to get through. We lost a lot of business during the pandemic and had to close operations in Uganda and Rwanda, as well as majorly reduce our staff to four members,” he says.

By using digital wallets, Mr Muriuki hopes to facilitate financial inclusion throughout Africa. He says their wallets drive impact and that is what they want to accomplish, whether it’s a wallet for school feeding or access to healthcare.

He says by leveraging their digital wallet technology, they have made significant strides in addressing critical societal challenges, such as school feeding programmes, healthcare access, financial inclusion for economic empowerment and environmental impact by promoting cashless transactions.

“To achieve product-market fit for our WaaS service and scale at the regional level beyond Kenya, we aim to create and deploy 1 million wallets by the end of the year, become a licensed Payment Service Provider in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda by mid-next year and to create a positive impact in our society through our digital wallets,” he concludes.

Muriuki was awarded the prestigious 2023 Business Daily’s Top 40 under 40, most promising founders in 2023 by Founders Africa and has been nominated for the FortyUnder40 Africa awards for 2024.

Turkana hit by spike in donkey thefts amid illegal skin trade,"The Turkana County government is moving to register donkeys and regulate their movement as villages are reporting an increase in livestock theft.

Far-flung villages with limited security presence have been identified by donkey owners as targets of the illegal donkey skin trade.

This situation in villages in Loima, Turkana West, Lokichoggio, Turkana Central and Turkana North sub-counties is contributing to the dwindling donkey population, residents say.

The situation has now attracted the attention of authorities who have announced plans to implement new laws aimed at protecting donkeys from abuse and exploitation.

A donkey owner, Emmanuel Kisike claimed that since the establishment of a donkey slaughterhouse in 2017 in Turkana County, there have been increased cases of donkey theft because of their skin and not meat.

Read: Four arrested in Kirinyaga while ferrying donkey meat to Nairobi

“I lost seven donkeys at Lokiriama village in 2018. The thieves just took the skin from three of the animals and left the meat,” Mr Kisike said.

The situation was even widespread in major towns such as Lodwar after some locals were recruited as dealers in return for quick cash, he claimed.

“We fear that the donkeys may become extinct if such illegal dealings are not stopped. Thieves who don’t even rear a single goat brazenly steal and sell donkeys at throwaway prices,” Mr Kisike told Nation.africa,

There is a proposed legislation that will mandate proper identification and registration of donkeys, regulate their movement, and impose heavy penalties on those caught engaging in illegal trade or mistreatment of the animals.

Assistant County Commissioner from Turkana Central Sub County Michael Kiguta stated that the stock theft has caused a significant decline in the donkey population.

“I appeal to the management of the donkey slaughterhouses to resist involvement in underhand deals and ensure that for any donkey they buy legitimately belongs to an owner bearing clearance from the area chief and follow up call made as a proof,” Mr Kiguta said.

Read: 10 arrested while ferrying donkey meat to Nairobi

The Agency for Cross-Border Pastoralists Development executive director Samson Kimeli says the illegal donkey trade is driven by demand for donkey hides used in Chinese traditional medicines.

Mr Kimeli added that research by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization revealed that the animals face extinction because the existing donkey population cannot sustain the business of the four slaughterhouses.

“We are creating awareness of the need to protect donkey during meetings with donkey owners, authorities, and local leaders. We also support animal health check-ups, treatment, and educational sessions on how to properly care for donkeys,” he said.

Mr Julius Ekalale, a resident said that the current population of donkeys in the county is low due to the beast of burden’s long gestation period of 12 months.

Another farmer Maxmillah Akai said women in remote areas rely on donkeys to fetch water and carry food items from the market.

“We need support from the government to stop commercialisation of the donkey trade as it is negatively affecting our way of life,” Ms Akai said.

Kaptembwa families affected by floods receive aid,"More than 6,000 flood victims in the South Rift are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, Head of Red Cross in the region Felix Maiyo has said.

Mr Maiyo stated that the hardest hit are more than 2,000 people in Baringo County who are also affected by insecurity.

“The rains are subsiding but many of the victims, particularly those in Baringo County who were first displaced by insecurity, are still suffering. I urge well-wishers to come and assist them. Some of the children are yet to report back to school as their school items like books and uniforms, as well as the institutions, were destroyed by floods,” said Mr Maiyo.

He spoke at Kaptembwa slums in Nakuru City where he led his team to distribute foodstuffs donated by the Sarova Woodlands Hotel and Spa and Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge staff to more than 1,500 victims. The informal settlements are home to more than 100,000 residents.

While the assistance did not reach all those in need, Mr Maiyo said that the Red Cross was engaging well-wishers to enable them to offer more help.

“We have been able to get assistance for only 300 families and I thank Sarova Hotels and Resorts Kenya for responding to our call to help the affected families,” said Mr Maiyo.

Support

Cluster General Manager in charge of Sarova Woodlands Hotel and Spa and Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge Duncan Mwangi assured the residents of support.

“Sarova Hotels and Resorts cares for all Kenyans in dire need, including those affected by floods,” said Mr Mwangi.

Nakuru West sub-county assistant county commissioner Sharon Chelagat urged residents whose houses collapsed after the floods not to return to their homes until government geologists complete investigations into the deep fissures near their houses.

The government has deployed senior geologists to Nakuru for more detailed studies after the floods left massive fissures in Kaptembwa area. Most of the houses that collapsed were built near sand quarries.

Confident KDF ready to shine in KVF playoffs,"Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) coach Jackline Baraza has attributed her team's qualification to the Kenya Volleyball Federation National League playoffs to persistence, patience, and hard work.

Baraza, who was appointed KDF coach in 2020, guided the team to fifth place with 10 points from eight as the regular season ended at the Moi International Sports Centre Indoor Gymnasium on Sunday.

The top two teams from the playoffs will book automatic tickets to next year's African Clubs Championship.KDF, who last competed in the playoffs in 2017, will line up for the coveted title against holders KCB Women's Volleyball Team, Kenya Pipeline, Kenya Prisons, and Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI).

Others are Nairobi Prison, Post Bank, and Kenya Army.

Baraza, a former international, said making it to the playoffs after six years of trying was an inspiration to the players who have always put in the work but failed to make the cut.

""I'm super proud of the players who will finally play in the last eight. We are likely to start the campaign against DCI, who have defeated us in our previous encounters, but we will give the match our best shot and see how it pans out,"" said Baraza, 44.

""We will use the play-offs as a build-up for the upcoming African Military Games in Abuja, Nigeria. We want to build a formidable side that will soon challenge for the league title,"" she added.

The expansion of playoff slots from four to eight also saw Kenya Army, Nairobi Prisons, and Post Bank, who made their maiden appearance in the league last season, book their slots for the first time.

Since 2018, KCB, Pipeline, Kenya Prisons, and DCI have been regulars in the playoffs

Okutoyi’s Olympics dream hangs in the balance,"African Games women's tennis champion, Angella Okutoyi, remains optimistic about her chances of qualifying for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

The 20-year-old needs to break into the Top 400 by June 10, but the fight for crucial points has not gone quite well.

The USA-based player was working on getting between 70 and 100 points after moving one step closer to the Summer Games by winning the 2023 African Games in Accra, Ghana in March this year, but has managed 18 so far.

She collected two points from reaching the second round of the qualifying draw at W75 Charlottesville and eight each from W35 Boca Raton and W35 Bethany Beach main draw quarter-final stage.

The three events were held on her favourite surface clay.

Okutoyi is ranked 523 with 101 points in the WTA singles rankings, and is left with two make-or-break tournaments in Tunisia - W35 La Marsa (May 27 to June 2) and W50 La Marsa (June 3-9).

“I still have three weeks, so anything could change. I’m going to give all I have and whatever happens. I leave it to God,” the 2022 Wimbledon Doubles junior champion told Nation Sport on phone on Sunday.

To realize her dream of competing at the Paris 2024 Olympics, the 20-year-old has no room for slip-ups in the La Marsa tournaments where there is a high possibility that she will start in the qualifying draw.

In her latest outing, Okutoyi, who won gold in singles and silver in doubles at the African Games, lost 6-2, 6-1 against Swede Kajsa Rinaldo in the quarter-finals of the Sea Colony Tennis in Delaware on Friday.

She was also eliminated in doubles in the quarter-final stage after losing 6-3, 4-6, 10-4 alongside Ukrainian partner Anita Sahdiieva, at the hands of American pair Ashton Bowers and Mia Yamakita.

Suffering retirees deserve accessing their pension contribution without delay,"Pensioners are happy to hear that savings of up to Sh30,000 per month in retirement benefit schemes could soon be tax-exempt should Parliament pass a Bill that seeks to raise the figure from the current Sh20,000. Many of us have received nothing as a pension as some die from sickness, hardships and poverty despite having worked hard all those years.

The proposed law would motivate people to save more for retirement, which will also lower their tax liability. The proposed 50 per cent increase in the figure is contained in the Finance Bill, 2024, which seeks to amend Section 5 of the Income Tax Act that allows Kenya Revenue Authority to exempt from tax up to Sh240,000 annual income contributed as pension.

Pensioners now hope for the prompt passing of the Bill in Parliament and the President’s assent. Retirees hope to get tax-free pension and without delay.

Kimani Meja Njuguna, Kiambu

* * *

As a pensioner, I smiled as I read your editorial, “Save retirees from agony” (Daily Nation, May 16). I agree with you that pensioners have not been treated well. Pensioners have remained at the mercy of their former employers, who see nothing good in them.

This has seen many of them die early due to hopelessness. The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2024 seeks to amend the Pensions Act, Cap 189, to include an automatic cost of living adjustment to the pensions earned by all retired public servants.

As you rightly suggested, private sector retirees should be included; all retirees spent their best years building the nation. Some private sector retirees get some semblance of COLA. But it is not guaranteed because it’s given at the discretion of the trustees, such that many years pass before one is mercifully granted.

It should be automatic and not left at the whims of a few unwilling trustees, who can easily be compromised and deny the pensioners their due.

Young farmer puts smile on dairy and poultry keepers,"Peter Ng’ang’a is a man on a mission. He wants the best for dairy and poultry farmers in Nembu village, Gatundu South constituency, Kiambu County. Ng’ang’a’s quest began after his first poultry project failed. More than half the chicks he had started with died as he had little knowledge on feed.

“My background is humble. I started with about 100 chicks, but was left with just 40 after a few days,” he says.

The agribusiness started soon after Ng’ang’a had completed his secondary school education and enrolled for a six-month course on animal feed formulation at the Dairy Training Institute, Naivasha.

Ng’ang’a did not want to repeat the same mistakes he made on feeding his chicks.

After the training, Ng’ang’a founded an organisation called Farmer’s Smile Africa.

“Getting high quality feed and information was a big challenge. I also had problems with delivering products on time. That is why I came up with the idea of creating the brand. We wanted to provide quality products, information and services to farmers then make follow-ups,” he says.

Farmer’s Smile Africa boasts of 70 members that Ng’ang’a trains, mentors and involves in demonstrations. The members are dairy and poultry farmers.

“I help address problems farmers encounter by providing information. The organisation also works with experts. When, for instance, a farmer needs information on horticulture, I refer him or her to the appropriate experts,” he says.

mencken indent: Ng’ang’a also owns a shop that sells feed for cows, pigs and poultry. He has invested in technology that mixes the raw materials after formulating. A tonne of feed for dairy cows is made in 40 minutes only.

Farmer’s Smile Africa also links livestock owners with insurance companies.

“The animals are insured against death, diseases and accidents,” Ng’ang’a says.

Farmers in Nembu have formed groups with the purpose of sharing knowledge.

Isabel Wairimu, a dairy farmer and a member of Farmer’s Smile Africa, is the chairperson of Gathage Mwanzo Mpya Group.

“Before being trained on proper feeding, I used to call an animal health service provider regularly to give them injections. That has changed. The health of my cows has improved and their skins are smooth,” the 56-year-old says.

“The quantity of milk has more than doubled. One of my cows used to produced just five litres of milk a day. The amount has risen to 11. The younger one produces about 20 litres.”

Wairimu sells her milk to cooperative societies and individuals. She monitors her cows from birth. The farmer says the quality and quantity of milk production is determined by the age of the animal. Wairimu’s poultry project is also thriving.

“Many people come to buy eggs for hatching. It makes me happy for it shows that I’m helping other households start or improve their farming. I also grow Napier grass, bananas, avocados and other crops,” she says.

Antonio Innocent Mudong’i, an animal nutritionist, compares a dairy cow to a baby, saying production can be expensive.

“When you chop and press Napier grass, water will come out. Farmers need to note that about 80 per cent of the grass is water,” he says.

“The animal will naturally be tempted to eat such grass. The farmer should ensure the grass dries and then chop it. Give the animal three kilogrammes of the dry matter.”

Mudong’i advises farmers to harvest hay when flowering as that is the time nutrients are most concentrated. There is also a good protein level in the grass.

“Lack of knowledge by farmers leads to poor feeding. Because of that, the animal gets diarrhoeal and other opportunistic diseases,” he says.

The illnesses are also as a result of feed that is full of aflatoxin. Do not preserve the feed in an area full of moisture.”

"Agony of nightclubs, churches in city estates","“We can’t sleep because of the noise. They come, party, and then leave in the morning to go to their quiet neighbourhoods,” says Obadae Mwaura, a resident of Mirema Drive in Nairobi. For five years now, Mr Mwaura, a pastor, has been among the hundreds of residents of Mirema Drive in Nairobi who have had to endure the ear-shattering noises, causing them sleepless nights, and the increasingly skimpily dressed revellers ‘behaving badly’, causing them shame.

When Mr Mwaura moved in more than two decades, he says, Mirema was “safe and habitable.” But everything changed five years ago when the first nightclub opened its doors. Then the second. The third. And more sprouted.

“Within a year, the clubs had reigned supreme in our once quiet estate,” he says.

A once relatively tranquil estate tucked less than a kilometre from the busy Thika Superhighway and a stone’s throw away from TRM Mall, it was a relatively prestigious address with bungalows and maisonettes dotting the area. But slowly, it has turned into a concrete jungle of high-rise apartment blocks, shops, churches, and nightclubs.

Read: Three Mirema clubs, Church fined Sh5m for noise pollution, ordered closed

One section of the road is fully lined with liquor stores. By 7 pm, nightlife kicks in, ushered by young women in tiny dresses walking into the clubs. Njuguna Mbigi, the chair of the Amani Residents Association/Mirema, says they are exhausted by the constant noise pollution from the clubs. “Everybody comes home tired, hoping to rest, but you wake up tired in the morning to go to work after spending the night annoyed at the noise, tossing and turning,” he says.

The residents moved to court, suing over “noise pollution and public nuisance.”

In a landmark ruling that is likely to set a precedent in the tale of pubs and churches in residential areas, delivered earlier this month, the Environmental and Land Court (ELC) ordered the closure of three clubs and a church in Mirema Drive and fined them Sh5 million over noise pollution. “This judgment, I believe, is going to bring soberness,” says Mr Mwaura.

However, when Lifestyle spent the better part of the day in the area, talking to residents and observing whether the four had complied with the court order to close, we found them still operational. “The impression we get is that they are not inclined to respect either the law or the court order,” says Mr Mbigi.

For the uninitiated, Mirema estate – where Samuel Muvota was shot dead in broad daylight – is sandwiched between Roysambu estate and the Northern Bypass.

He is particularly disheartened by the continued operation of Trinity House International Church and three nightclubs: La Tessara Lounge, Cocorico, and Paris Lounge Mirema.

Soundproof homes

Mr Mwaura said some residents have had to find ways to shield themselves from the noise, which feels like their bedrooms or living rooms sit next a stack of speakers.

“My neighbours, especially those very near these places, have had to soundproof their homes because the noise is unbearable,” he tells Lifestyle. Another annoyance is the traffic jams and crowded streets. “When we moved here, we would jog and ride bikes along Mirema Drive, but now you can’t.

For instance, on Friday nights, it can take you even an hour to drive 800 metres to your house because of the heavy traffic,” he says. There are hundreds of cars locked in a seemingly endless tussle for space to move or to park; people hooting for hours on end; and the gridlocks last for hours as cars take detours into various nightspots. The boom-boom of the discordant music, rhumba here, Gengetone there, leave one with a noise-induced headache.

“Paris Lounge [one of the clubs in the area] has at least 17 speakers, which I counted,” says Mr Mbigi.

Sodom and gomorrah

But it is not only Mr Mbigi lamenting; another resident who has also lived in the area for more than two decades drew a grim comparison, likening the night activities at Mirema to the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The estate houses dozens of pubs and wine and spirit shops. By midnight, the streets are full of rowdy, drunk people.

“When you walk here at night, I find young people all over. How they are dressed is despicable; I don’t know what is happening with our country,” says Rosemary Ndula.

She laments the sight of young women engaging in questionable behaviour, staggering out of the bars and clubs.

Read: Mirema estate, the new home of twilight life and noise

“As property owners and residents of this area, we have seen that unless we raise our voices on this issue, in the long term, this is going to have some very serious repercussions. Trends are changing; we do not have to be rigid with our by-laws [city planning and zoning laws], but what is going on must change,” she says.

Their stories are etched with torment as the residents bemoan the fading charm of the once-homey estate. Besides the noisy nightclubs, there is the nuisance of Airbnb hosts, most of whom book the houses to hold parties.

Beyond the walls of the club, innumerable residents in this emerging beer belt can barely close their eyes for hours as the loud music from the nearly one dozen clubs within a radius of 300 metres keeps denying them that luxury.

Some of the homeowners in Mirema have moved out and are now renting out their houses to short-stay users.

Concerns over children

Raising children in estates with blaring noise is very hard. Not many toddlers can sleep through it. The ELC Judge, Judy Omange, while ruling in favour of Amani Residents Welfare Association/Mirema in an affidavit submitted by Mr Mbigi, and John Koogi, a resident of the estate, cited concerns over children.

“The petitioner is, therefore, seeking refuge from this court to protect the right of its residents to a clean and healthy environment and also ensure that the children of Mirema Drive grow up in an environment that guarantees their right to life, survival, wellbeing, protection, and development as provided by the Children Act. 32,” the court ruled.

One of the parents who has been frustrated to the point where they do not want to live in the estate is Susan Wambui, a mother of two—a fiveyear-old and a nine-month-old.

She lives barely 200 metres from Cocorico and Trinity Church. She describes the experience of putting up with the loud music and screams as a nightmare. “I am telling you this is a nightmare. I have a nine-month-old child who wakes up at just the sound of me breathing. You can imagine that with the noise, she is wide awake the whole night, and this is too much,” she told Lifestyle in a past interview.

“I’m not against partying, but it’s just too much for me and my children. I am even thinking of moving because I can’t live here one more month.” Eddy Kagera, a father of two young boys, says he was forced to move out of the neighbourhood after the clubs started opening in every corner. He says he could not bear it.

“I moved in in 2018, and after the clubs started springing up, it was even more difficult to walk my son to picked up for school. You would encounter skimpily dressed women early in the morning as they left the clubs to go home.

I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said in a past interview. There is also schools nearby and one wonders if the location is conducive for children.

Seven clubs

According to Mr Mbigi, the residents of Mirema first invited at least seven clubs to talk and iron out the noise problem, but only four sent their representatives.

“We sent letters for them to come and have a discussion on how to reduce the noise, the church and three of the clubs sent their representatives and they agreed to reduce the noise, but the other three did not,” he says. One of the clubs, Charm Lounge, has since closed. The association, which consists of about 500 members, says that they just want peace.

“So many jobs have come up along this road. But the noise is unbearable. These places run the whole night,” adds Mr Mwaura. Concerns over pubs and clubs in residential areas are not only a Mirema concern. In Nairobi’s Eastlands, Lang’ata, Dagoretti and Kilimani areas, the sounds that came through the walls of many residents, at full blast, have become frequent inconveniences.

Read: Inside Nairobi’s quest to control noise in residential areas

Data from the Nairobi County Liquor Board shows that by 2021, Starehe constituency had the highest number of registered liquor stores (88), followed by Roysambu (where Mirema is located, 48).

Lang’ata and Dagoretti North both had 35 new wine and spirits shops. In the past three years, the numbers may have doubled or tripled as pub investments in estates increased. There are noise laws in place.

Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja had last year ordered the closure of clubs over noise pollution, leading to an uproar from investors who argued that the move would lead to the loss of jobs. Mr Sakaja lifted the order. In 2018, the High Court declared the sale of alcohol in estates illegal for bars and nightclubs to operate near schools and residential areas.

“Allowing bars and liquor-selling businesses within residential areas will thus violate the residents’ right to live in dignity and a healthy environment, fundamental rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights,” said Justice Chacha Mwita.

Other estates

The judge was delivering the verdict in an application filed by the Muimara Estate Residents Association, accusing Nairobi County of allowing a trader, Kariuki Kimiti, to operate a bar within their estate, which has young and school-going children, despite objections from the residents.

But as the neighbourhoods grow, so do the nightclub investors looking to make money from the growing population. And the noise is unlikely to stop unless authorities provide harsher penalties and stop licensing pubs, nightclubs, and liquor stores set in residential areas. Sospeter Mumbi, the Member of County Assembly (MCA) of Roysambu, says, “The people who are benefiting from these clubs are mostly not from Roysambu. They come, cause mayhem, disturb us, and then go back to their respective residential areas,” he says.

A majority of Nairobi residents know that the reality is that they cannot really expect silence if one has rented a house in an uncontrolled estate.

Cheaper rents and a lower cost of living have pushed city dwellers to areas like Eastlands, Mathare, Kariobangi, and other low-income areas. But they cannot sleep, or they have to just learn how to sleep through the music, the sound systems for preaching and singing, especially on monthly vigils, and the neighbours talking loudly and blasting music through the thin walls. Their hope, they say, lies in Nairobi County leadership.

“The governor has all the powers to summon these investors and say enough is enough,” Mr Mumbi says. The current city development plan fails to clearly define, and specify, the boundaries and extent of commercial centres, says Mr Mbigi, who is also a lawyer.

“How can you allow or license pubs to operate within the vicinity of neighbourhoods and especially schools?”

Fake fertiliser: Kenya National Farmers Federation calls for compensation,"The fake fertiliser scandal is seen in some quarters as the greatest threat to Kenya’s food agenda. Farmers now want the government to ensure those involved in producing and selling the fakes are brought to book. Seeds of Gold writer Francis Mureithi talked to Dr Mwenda M’Mailutha, the CEO of Kenya National Farmers Federation (Kenaff)

You champion the interests of 837,000 farmers. How is Kenaff handling this scandal?

We have written to the Ministry of Agriculture demanding proper investigations on what exactly happened. President William Ruto has addressed the issue but we realise some things are not clear. The government must pursue the culprits and have them prosecuted. We want farmers to be compensated for the losses incurred.

There are reports of farmers being duped into buying fake seeds. What is Kenaff doing about this?

We were referred to Kenya Seeds Company, which said it is investigating the issue. A scandal of this magnitude could be an inside job. We hope the relevant arms of the government will carry out investigations. The matter has been taken up by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.

What has been the response after Kenaff wrote three memorandums to the government?

We have not received a response on whether the farmers who bought fake fertiliser will be compensated. Kenaff and other agriculture players are still waiting for this feedback.

How is your organisation helping farmers understand climate change adaptation and mitigation?

Kenaff has a 2022-26 strategic plan called “Watering the Tree for Growth”. It puts farmers at the heart of climate action and resilience to cushion them against emerging emergencies and shock. We are training farmers to contribute to climate action through water harvesting, kitchen gardens, farm forestry, afforestation, soil health and biodiversity conservation. We are mobilising farmers to plant and take care of 10 billion trees.



What policies would make farming more lucrative?

One policy that needs urgent attention is access to finance and affordable credit. This incorporates insurance, social protection for farmers and crop and livestock insurance.

Most Kenyan farmers have no life cover. Kenaff is working with insurance firms to sensitise farmers on taking medical covers. They need to remain healthy as they work on their lands.

The other area is technical advisory services. The government needs to focus on extension services if we are to transform our agriculture.

Devolved governments no longer hire extension service officers. What is Kenaff’s opinion on this?

Farmers do not have technical skills, the latest innovations in the market or access to research from public universities and other institutions that would help boost production. This is because there are no extension officers to break down the study findings and other information to farmers. Kenaff has raised concerns about this.

If that is the case, what is your organisation doing to address the problem?

We offer training to farmers through the Kenaff Knowledge Series programme which has 22 topics, including soil health, animal nutrition and agronomy. We do this through text messages, Kenaff Apps, videos, farmers field days and workshops.

The biggest challenge is our limited workforce and financial resources. If we had these, we would roll out a robust technical service to farmers all over the country.

How would you describe the success?

We have mobilised farmers’ groups and cooperative societies in 17 counties. These groups negotiate prices of their produce. Some farmers in Makueni County have found a way of exporting mangoes to Germany. We have also connected avocado farmers in Meru with markets in South Korea and Germany.

Through Kenaff, farmers have accessed credit from commercial banks.

Do farmers benefit from Wakulima markets in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisumu and other big towns?

The markets, popularly known as marikiti, are very complex. Many farmers do not gain anything from these markets.

This calls for the government to streamline operations in the markets so that farmers are allowed to sell directly to hotels and other high consumers like state institutions that get produce from marikitis.

What is Kenaff doing to encourage young people to venture into agriculture?

We have a department called Kenaff Young, which looks out for young people involved in farming. We look for models in agriculture and showcase their innovations and success stories.

Through this, we have developed leadership and exchange programmes where young farmers meet and share their experiences and knowledge.

We have established a partnership with the World Farmers Organisation in Italy, to benefit from the youth programme.

We are also working with farmers’ associations in Germany and Italy where we take young people there for three months. Kenaff is negotiating for a similar programme with the National Farmers Union in the United States.

We’re have partnered with the German development agency (GIZ), Egerton University, the University of Nairobi and other institutions in Kenya on programmes encouraging young people to try a hand in agriculture.

We are also working with 4K Clubs and the newly launched Kenya Agricultural Students Association to ignite interest in farming in children.

What is your take on disabled farmers struggling to work with unfriendly machines and equipment?

We need a concrete policy that will provide a framework which guides the formulation of laws supporting and addressing the plight of such farmers. Kenaff has boards at the county level which have representatives from disabled persons.

Do you support the proposed taxes on produce?

Kenaff is against these taxes. We need to create an enabling environment for farmers to enhance productivity and efficiency. Farmers cannot access credit to support production. There’s no good infrastructure and extension services.

Many farmers have no access to post-harvest technology, irrigation, driers and cold storage facilities. The majority are not even aware of the Warehouse Receipt Systems. Many have not formed value chain-based cooperatives.

If farmers are provided with these and are not incurring high production costs, they will have no problem paying taxes.

What would be the Kenaff scorecard for the government on agriculture be after more than a year in office?

I will give the government a C+. There is a lot to be done by the government to make farming the real backbone of Kenya’s economy. The Warehouse Receipt System and Commodity Exchange are brilliant and transformative ideas. Kenaff welcomes reforms at the Agricultural Finance Corporation to help fund priority value chains.

What to do when lumpy skin disease hits your animals,"Limping cattle is a common problem in dairy farming. I narrated last week how one of my heifers started limping on all four legs overnight. The problem was caused by a viral disease called ephemeral fever or three-day-sickness.

Fortunately, most cases of the diseases recover uneventfully within about three days with or without treatment. Such diseases are said to be self-limiting.

This week again, Francis my farmhand, reported another heifer limping on the left hind leg. He thought it was the same disease as the previous one. In medicine, we call such disease determination diagnosis by rote.

This means diagnosing a disease because the signs shown resemble the ones seen in another patient previously. It is a highly discouraged method of diagnosis for different diseases share signs.

However, a trained eye will know the signs that are common to a group of diseases or conditions and the few signs that are specific to a particular illness.

For instance, many farmers report chicken being dull, have ruffled feathers, closing eyes and diarrhoea.

Read: Meet a woman vet riding high on love for livestock

Such a description would not be useful to a doctor in diagnosing the problem because there are many chicken diseases with the same signs.

But when a doctor examines the bird physically and does some post mortem examinations, she is able to see signs such as the diarrhoea being green, chocolate, chocolate with blood streaks or yellow.

At post mortem, the doctor would also see the internal organs affected by the disease and how the illness effects look like. Therefore, it is a combination of unique disease signs that helps the doctor to make a fairly accurate diagnosis rather than just the obvious signs.

I usually tell farmers that diagnosing a disease by rote is like trying to guide someone to a location in the streets of Nairobi and telling them they will know the place when they see an M-Pesa stall.

I told Francis I would check the heifer once I got to the farm later in the day. Once I arrived, I observed the animal from a distance and saw it was feeding well. The face was bright and the body looked normal.

When the animal moved, I noted the limp on the left hind leg. It was limping from the joint below the heel.

The heifer was able to put quite some weight on the affected leg but would lift the leg if made to move fast.

I instructed Francis to put all the animals in the crush because I wanted to diagnose pregnancies and vaccinate the cows against foot and mouth disease. Once the animals were restrained, I examined their legs.

I found the limping heifer had a swollen lymph node at the base of the leg. The lower leg was swollen from the hoof joint to the area below the hock joint.

The hock is the joint that many people confuse with the animal’s knee. It is the joint below the udder.

I noticed the swollen section of the leg had two fresh wounds that oozed dilute blood and some clear fluid. I observed another heifer with the same kind of wounds at the same location on the right leg. Both animals were eating well and did not seem bothered much by the swelling and the wounds.

Read: Call me if your cow swallows nail or wire

I concluded the animals had a mild form of lumpy skin disease or LSD. It is caused by a pox virus that is spread by mosquitoes and biting flies.

The disease is easily prevented by vaccination once a year. It mainly occurs in the rainy season when fly populations are high.

LSD vaccine is readily available in Kenya. I have vaccinated my cattle every year for the last five years without fail.

While two or three animals have shown the mild form of the disease every year, I have been spared full or even moderately severe disease even when cows in the area have shown full-blown disease.

This means the vaccine has been effective in inducing immunity in my cows.

My experience with LSD in vaccinated cattle is that it may cause swelling of the whole or part of a leg. The virus damages the walls of lymphatic vessels and causes fluid to ooze into the tissues.

Infected immune cattle will drop slightly in milk yield. Some have low grade fever while others may have some very small round swellings on the skin. The effects of the disease in vaccinated animals may last two to three days but the appetite is not affected.

In unvaccinated cattle, LSD causes large round raised swellings in the skin and mucous membranes with very high fever of up to 41 degrees Centigrade.

Deaths may be high, especially among calves. There is no specific cure for the disease but some antibiotics are known to improve the chances of recovery.

I treated my limping heifer with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent infection of the wounds and reduce swelling.

I chose to leave the second heifer to heal without medication because the damage to the leg and other effects of the infection appeared to be waning.

It is good practice to only use medication when it is extremely necessary.

Remembering Benga great DO Misiani 18 years on,"For Benga fans beginning Friday and throughout the weekend, it will be an opportunity to cherish and mark the 18th anniversary since the death of the legendary Benga musician Daniel Owino (DO) Misiani.

The great musician died in a grisly road accident near Kisumu town on May 17, 2006, and was band leader of the DO 7 Shirati Jazz Band (also popularly known as the “King of history”). Born in Shirati, Tanzania, he moved to Kenya in the mid-60s where he groomed his illustrious Benga musical career.

Speaking to Saturday Nation, Benga music producer George Ouma of Jojo Records recalled the great times he had shared with Misiani.

“He was a jovial and remorseful person who never held a grudge. In the event of any dispute he would ensure it was settled as soon as possible, ” Ouma added.

Notably, Ouma also recalled having produced some of Misiani's great songs like  Ukombozi I and II  and The late Julius Nyerere.

Some of Misiani’s popular songs include Isabella Muga, Lala Salama,  Kiseru, Christina Jaber and Safari ya Amerika  Notably  Safari ya Amerika was dedicated to his fans in the USA, where he occasionally toured to perform. While members of the Paris-based Congolese Soukous Stars did a rendition of Kiseru on their Nairobi Night medley song.

Misiani, like some of his counterparts, occasionally stirred controversy on some of his songs. Notably on Bim en Bim which put him into some trouble with some government authorities for mistaken messaging in the song.

Similarly, speaking to Saturday Nation,   yesterday  Benga musician Linet Aluoch Pamba recalled Misiani’s great potential in music.

“He was my greatest inspiration in music, especially when I was still a member of his DO 7 Shirati Jazz alongside others like his widow Queen Babito, Grace Tobias,  Odira Pombe Kali and Odhis, “she said.

Linet, who leads the Kisumu-based Karapul Jazz Band, recalled being among those who accompanied Misiani on some of his musical tours to Europe. Notably, his final tour to Europe in 2005, when they performed in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany.

During Misiani’s musical tours to the USA, Linet singled out Kenyan promoter Mathews Anyumba as amongst those on the frontline of supporting his shows there. Misiani’s son Jared Aywayo is also based in the USA.

As Linet pointed out, with no special concert set for this week in his honour, she will join most of Misiani’s fans in celebrating him online.

“Most of us who worked with him will be mainly sharing his music online alongside his fans,” Linet said.

She has also recently taken a break from live performances with plans to resume soon.

Some of the leading FM stations featuring Benga music like Ramogi FM, Nam  Lolwe FM, Dala FM and Lake Victoria FM are expected to dedicate some shows to Misiani’s music.

"‘As a woman, there’s pressure to constantly lead and excel on all fronts’","What's the most prized possession in your office?

I enjoy the view outside my office the most. I find it inspiring and limitless, which resonates with my personality.

My first name means a falcon, whereas Nilofer means a water lily. It's like you fly high, gallop, and fall like thunder in the water.

Your work demands lots of travel to different countries. How have the diverse experiences shaped you as an individual?

It has broadened my worldview significantly. You know, I was born and brought up in a small town in India. And, when you grow up in such an environment, your world is very limited in itself.

Your relationships, your network, your families, and your group of friends. This job has exposed me to different cultures, political systems, and developmental challenges.

All these experiences have made me more understanding and appreciative of diversity.

What’s the toughest part of settling into a new country, especially as a career woman?

I think I've grown into this role, as this is my fourth representative's role, and while I might seem to dive headfirst into new jobs, honestly, it wasn’t always this way.

In my initial career progression, there was extra pressure and the burden to prove a point. You know, I am here, I have arrived.

And I realised that it’s extremely burdensome especially when you are a woman because you are often put under surveillance.

People are going to put you on a test; they want to see how you’re doing, how you’re able to manage the issues, conflicts, and all of that.

But as you grow into roles, you realise that everything has its own time to address it. Over time, throughout these different jurisdictions, I've learned there’s no need to rush in to prove yourself.

In basketball, there’s an interesting saying: “Lead with your offhand.” Whether you’re right or left-handed, it means developing your weaker side to become more well-rounded.

Just like in basketball, as a woman, there’s the pressure to constantly ‘lead’ on all fronts – excelling in every area and being visible everywhere.

And that's an unnecessary pressure that you put on yourself. But later in my career, I didn't necessarily think that was this important.

If you could tell me, drawing from what you've just said, you often travel alone, and your family still lives in India, how do you adjust to new postings, say the one in Kenya, with your family not around?

You know, it has both sides to it. The better part of it is that you go and start your work without having to think about family logistics.

But the downside is you feel very lonely in the initial days, and it takes time to make friends. Work can easily become your whole world.

Thirty years in senior leadership positions is quite a long time. What has helped you to stay in those positions?

When I reflect on my career path, it fills me with immense gratitude. It's been a journey of muddying my boots and soiling my hands, literally.

I value those experiences very much because I understand the ground reality very well, from the development nuances to the interface between politics and development. I have worked in countries like Afghanistan, countries in South Asia, Central Asia and now, in Africa.

I have seen the vast spectrum of developmental challenges across continents. The way the governments run, the geopolitics, the macroeconomics, and the situations there. These experiences have been extremely helpful for me.

What do you love most about Kenya?

I love travelling in this place. And I love the sheer green. This is one very beautiful country.

What career advice would you give to those seeking to climb up the career ladder?

Never give up too early. Because I know as a young professional woman, there are a lot of obligations that you will face. And sometimes it can take you on a guilt trip.

You know, like you are neglecting your family and other responsibilities. I say, embrace it but don’t let it hold you back.

Notably, this applies in many ways to men too. Importantly, take every roadblock as an opportunity to grow, and enjoy what you're doing.

What does tomorrow look like for a child in Kenya, and in any other part of the world?

Primarily, I do see there's a lot of hope and optimism. It is about ensuring that we come together because the time to act is now.

And we just have about barely five to six years before we hit the finishing line to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)2030.

I strongly believe that it is a doable proposition, and Kenya will be able to achieve its commitment to SDGs for children, if we can bring in our collective efforts, both in terms of our resources, ensuring that the fund flow for those commitments, and the budgetary allocations for the children are sustained.

Pulse of the Street: Freezing city life through the lens,"In the hustle and bustle of the city, where ambition collides with disappointment, there exists a group of silent observers – street photographers.

This is a generation of young people who, armed with amateur equipment and towering determination, set up their cameras in various Nairobi streets ready to freeze urban life through their skills. We explore their motivations and creative processes as they talk about the legacy they seek to leave.

Dennis Rayori, 25                  Kakashots PhotographyI am a student at the University of Nairobi pursuing a degree in environmental and biosystems engineering, but my dream is to build a career in music and theatre.

I started KAKASHOTS photography in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic as a company that offered graphics design services, but in the process, I learnt a lot about photography and videography.

Initially, my main motive for diving into photography was to create content. My very first video, which I produced without spending much money, received positive feedback from my social media followers. That encouraged me and fueled my passion for photography, and eventually, I turned it into a source of income.

After the coronavirus pandemic, my interest in photography blossomed. As an artist, I decided to start doing my own projects. Armed with determination, I turned to YouTube for guidance. I learned how to set up a camera, record footage, and edit it. My first video received positive response from viewers, and this marked the beginning of my photography journey.

In my trade, I prioritise speed and unique colours. I like vibrant hues and use various techniques to set my work apart. Above all, I strive for client satisfaction by delivering both speed and quality.

As a videographer and photographer, my work begins on set. I visualise the desired outcome and focus on specific images. In every shoot, I choose props that yield the best results with minimal post-processing work. This approach ensures that I provide excellent services to each client without compromising on quality.

One thing that fascinates me about working in Nairobi city is the vibrant scenery of the streets. It is an experience unique to Nairobi, and I appreciate the city’s beauty. Recently, a Tanzanian friend who was visiting for the first time marveled at Nairobi's aesthetics, and this reinforced my desire to capture its full essence through photography.

Despite challenges like weather and security concerns, street photography thrives here.

I earn about Sh60,000 from my hustle, which is not enough to cater for all my needs. I charge between Sh300 and Sh2,000 per photo depending on the package a client chooses.

I see about five clients a day and work six days a week from Tuesday to Sunday. I normally set up my camera along Muindi Mbingu Street. On the streets, I approach clients who have nice outfits or those with creative and unique tastes and interest them in my services.

To thrive as a street photographer, you must have the right type of lenses. You have to consider the subject of your photos.While at work, I often plan a photograph’s composition before I snap. However, if someone requests a photo with the entire building in the background, we do that during the post-editing process where we also remove unwanted individuals from the frame to maintain privacy. Many dislike being photographed without their consent, and it is also illegal to do that, so before taking a photo on the streets, we approach the subject politely and ask for permission. Most agree, and their happiness becomes our joy.

Thankfully, in Nairobi and many towns in Kenya, street photographers like me are free to do their jobs and put their talent to use. I like that through quality images, we help preserve our clients’ memories. It is a profession that indeed empowers young people.

Felix Onyango, 21 Felz shots PhotographyI am a student at Egerton University pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in communication and mass media. My dream is to become a journalist. To me, photography is about more than capturing images. It is about preserving memories. Photography is my passion, and it is a skill I have honed alongside my media studies.

It's all about storytelling, and I find it effortless to express myself through photography. Cameras have my heart, I can't explain why. With a year of photography experience, my greatest challenge is affording the lenses I need. For now, I'm using the basic ones where I have fun zooming in and playing with exposure.

Capturing high-quality photos begins with understanding your camera. Cameras offer various settings. The resolution, measured in pixels, affects image size. When exporting images for editing, consider the software's requirements. Some software sometimes automatically adjusts images, depending on settings.

Personally, I lean toward Lightroom because it allows me to focus on any subject, whether a person or an object.

Third-party photography apps have revolutionised the way we capture moments. Consider connecting your camera to your phone wirelessly…the AI, (Artificial intelligence) makes it seamless. It's like having a knowledgeable companion behind the lens, ensuring optimal results.

I charge Sh100 for edited photos and Sh50 for non-edited photos.

I can’t say how much I earn on average because at times I don’t get clients. Because I have to go to school, I don’t do this on fulltime basis. I don't have specific days considered for working, but I always avail myself when I am not burdened with schoolwork. I move from place to place. While on school holiday I set base in Kisumu, while the rest of the time I am in Nakuru.

Ultimately, my goal is to keep growing as a photographer, to continue exploring the world through my lens, and to share meaningful images that resonate with viewers. Whether that’s primarily through street photography or branching out into other genres down the line, I’ll let my passion and creative instincts guide me. Journalism is what excites me most.

Irene Kimosop, 26            I.K Pixel StudiosI graduated with a Diploma in Project Management from Kenya Institute of Project Management (KIPM) in year 2019. Initially my dream was to be a journalist, but I am still happy being a photographer.

With two years of experience, I've majored in capturing and editing images that tell compelling stories.

Each day brings new learning opportunities, and I always strive for creativity. I got training in editing from a professional photographer, Mr K Conlon in 2022, although I relied more on my passion and the skills I learned on the job.

I focused on refining my editing skills, and used the skills I had learned as a former model to create impactful images.

I enjoy outdoor shoots, and portrait photography because of its ability to capture the essence of a person’s character and emotions. I work alongside a talented team of makeup artists and hairstylists. It's about teamwork, drawing inspiration from others, and having a keen eye for details. It's not just about capturing moments but also crafting them through meticulous editing.

Understanding your subjects is key. Even if their vision differs from yours, adapt and find common ground.

The toughest project I've ever handled was when I had to take up a wedding assignment at the last minute. The experience was both exhilarating and demanding, as there was little time to plan. I stepped in when their previous photographer fell through, so I was more of a backup.

Despite facing traffic delays on the very day and missing some vital equipment, I delivered my best work. The challenge I had was balancing the client's expectations. Originally it was supposed to be a five-hour shoot, but I had to extend my time as the client kept coming up with different requests throughout the day. It was difficult, but I had to deliver.

Navigating client requests and discerning genuine projects can be challenging. Sometimes, last-minute shoots or projects can come with unexpected twists. Imagine agreeing to an outdoor shoot, only to have the location change abruptly. I was once booked by two men for an outdoor shoot in an unfamiliar location. I was with a group of men and as we approached the location, I felt uncomfortable.

Being the only woman, without security, and with two unknown male clients leading me to a strange location, I knew I had to find a way out. Relying on my instincts, I waited for the perfect moment, took a motorbike and escaped from the questionable shoot. Ours is an unpredictable yet rewarding craft.

I earn Sh80,000 a month on average. I have different charges depending on the package a client picks. Wedding and birthday coverage ranges between Sh10,000 and Sh140,000 depending on a client's demands.

A photo costs Sh150 while an outdoor photo session costs a minimum of Sh7,000. I.K Pixel Studios is located in Tassia estate and I work every day except Tuesdays.

I use social media and referrals to get clients.

Reagan Ochieng, 24 Stavi Arts PhotographyI am a final year student at the University of Eldoret pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education, but my passion is in photography and videography.

I have been in this business for four years, and my expertise lies in editing, camera setting, and picture retouching. My tools include the camera itself, a sturdy stand, a speedlight for controlling light, and a softbox which modifies the quality of light.As an outdoor photographer, I focus on capturing natural scenes, and I rely on Photoshop for editing.

To ensure a successful client experience, establishing a good rapport is crucial. Light-hearted humour can put clients at ease and encourage genuine smiles during shoots. Before starting my work, I spend time asking my client questions and getting to know them to make them comfortable.

If for any reason a client expresses dissatisfaction with my work and seeks a refund, I follow a systematic approach. First, I inquire about the specific issue. If it relates to lighting or other technical aspects, I address it promptly. If the concern can’t be resolved through editing, I propose a re-shoot.

Balancing academic commitments with my creative pursuits can be demanding, so to strike that equilibrium I deliberately schedule photo sessions on weekends. This allows me to focus on my studies during the week.

Mwiti Victor Lee, 23Bleev Creations PhotographyI'm a medical student at The University of Nairobi, pursuing Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. My dream career is to become a doctor, but passion led me to photography.

I initially experimented with a friend's camera, and gradually learned the ropes in my leisure time. Eventually, I bought my own equipment. I focus primarily on outdoor and street photography, as indoor clients are scarce.

My debut event was a dinner party for nurses held at Swiss Lenana Mount Hotel. The photos I captured exceeded my own expectations. Even though it was my first time to take professional photos, the results spoke volumes. Seeing people genuinely happy with my work fueled my passion.

In street photography, I often receive requests from clients to capture their portraits. I scout for suitable locations, often around the central business district (CBD) or other outdoor spots. However, not all clients are pleasant. Some doubt the quality of my work. Also, approaching strangers to request them to take photos for a fee can be quite a daunting task.

When buying equipment, I consider the lighting of my main locations and the environment. Considering power sources to keep the equipment fully charged and having the right lenses is highly important. For example, wide-angle lenses are best for outdoor shoots as they can capture expansive scenes. Narrow-angle lenses suit indoor settings. It's a delicate dance between vision and gear.

To successfully capture a client’s natural expressions, I ensure they feel comfortable and at ease during the shoot. In the editing process, I aim to make the pictures stand out and leave a lasting impression on the client. I don’t just go for ordinary snapshots. I also strive to maintain a natural aesthetic in my edits, and to capture emotions clearly.

How much I earn depends on the number of clients I get in a given duration. Just like any other business, there are high and low seasons. However, what I get is enough for my current lifestyle.

I charge Sh200 per photo and I work every day. To get new clients, I advertise my work on my social media accounts.

Safara out for blood after a sonar swindle,"My plan for today had been to spend the entire day at the Baraza Media Lab, relaxing by watching the premieres of 19 short movies at the Solutions Film Festival, sponsored by the Skoll Foundation, and presented by ‘Docubox’ that is headed by the legendary film director and founder, Judith Kibinge.

Instead, I was hot on the heels of some city swindlers, whom I am determined to see put behind bars if they do not do the right thing by The Safara. But I am getting ahead of my tale today.

Let’s roll back the clock many years back to when I was in Kenyatta University taking my undergraduate degree.There was this dude, Dan Odhiambo, who ran the printing shop.

So we meet up end of April 2024, in the middle of all my hassling, and Dan tells me he works for ‘Albat and Lari Solutions,’ a procurement firm on Gitanga Road.

He has a deal for me.

“Can you supply us with Sonar PR, an aquatic herbicide?”

“I can supply solar flares if there is a profit in it, Odhis,” I chuckled. “Why can’t you do it yourself, Dan?”

“Can’t!” Odhiambo shrugged. “Conflict of interest.”

Which is how I found myself at the offices of Albat and Lari, admiring the smart apartments of Gitanga Close, vowing to live in such a place myself someday soon. “Kusota na kuteseka ni kwa mda tu,” I said.

Meeting a man called Martin Opondo, he formally took note of my Expression of Interest to supply the Sonar herbicide, and a lady called Susan was at hand with the Local Purchase Order (LPO).

They agreed I bring a sample to their offices ASAP for approval first.

No sooner had I called Dan Odhiambo when the meeting with Susan and Opondo was done, and he had yet another useful tip.

“Go to Comet Mall,” Dan advised. “You will find a Sonar sample there.”

I did, and after paying Sh20,000 for the sample litres, I was on my way with it to the Albat & Lari offices, where Susan and Opondo took it.

A short while later, the email came through – the Hustler had been cleared to supply 1,000 litres of the aquatic herbicide. If I did not have the capacity (money) to do so all in one lot, I could bring it in batches.

“Mr Li,” I called my Chinese connection, “I need the 500K I deposited with you.”

“You longer no int-lest in investment in Safara Mass Colour company?”

“I need to double that dough if I’m to make your million by end month.”

“Be care full out there mai-kor,” the Chinese mall mandarin warned me.

“I know where they work,” I chuckled to him. “If they try to pull a fast one, you send your men to promote them all to higher glory, okay sir?”

Then Dan Odhiambo popped up, as a friend, with one more Ace card.

“I know a wholesaler of Sonar called Onesmus Mbaku Kimanzi,” he told me. “He can supply the stuff at Sh17,000 instead of Sh20,000 per litre.”

I quickly did the math – that would leave me with Sh75,000 from the half a million shillings that tycoon Li Zhang had returned to my bank account. Half the ‘blood money’ that had been in the light blue duffel bag when my cousin Safari got washed away in those April flash floods.

That would pay my 25K flat rent, another 25K would be Neo’s fees (hopefully softening Laura’s heart too) and the remaining 25,000 bob carry me daily through May.

Meanwhile, on April 30, via Mpesa, I sent Sh100,000 for 25 per cent of the 100 litres to the wholesaler Onesmus M Kimanzi, with the till number reflecting as ‘Danada Merchants.”

The following day, after pressure from Dan Odhiambo (who said I would be paid ASAP after Labour Day), I deposited another Sh325,000 into the bank account of Danada Merchants.

Thursday, May 2, I am calling Onesmus Mbaka Kimanzi.

“We finished our chemical supplies at our Industrial Area warehouse,” he told me. “In-fact we are on the way to collect more from Namanga.”

“Who’s we?” I asked.

“Me and Dan,” Onesmus Kimanzi replied.

And that is when it hit me – ‘Danada Merchants’ was of course DAN Odhiambo. He was in cahoots with this so-called wholesaler Onesmus.

And ‘Albat & Lari’ were in all probability, a scam.

How could I have been so trusting of a chap I last saw in KU years ago?

I took the case to Central Police Station, and one of the investigators quickly confirmed after a trace that while my ‘wholesaler’ had claimed they had spent the night in Namanga, the location was really Roysambu.

To add insult to injury, after I tried to reverse the transaction, Onesmus actually called me to ask WHY I was trying to reverse the transaction.

Then to compound it all, I get an email from Albat & Lari ‘confirming’ they received the 100 litres of Sonar, but would only pay when I supplied them with all 250 litres. That is why the ‘Safara’ is seeing red today!

If these swindlers don’t refund the cheddar, then the DCI will have to go for the criminals – although I have also provided the chinku mandarin with names, numbers and addresses of these scammers, if necessary.

"Vera Sidika: Marriage was boring, the old Vera is now back!","In the kingdom of celebrity conspiracy and societal fascination, few names command attention quite like Vera Sidika. Renowned as a Kenyan socialite and entrepreneur, Vera’s journey from humble beginnings to high-profile status has been nothing short of captivating.

Known for her unapologetic attitude, glamorous lifestyle and fearless demeanour, Vera’s every move is criticised and celebrated in equal measure by her legion of fans and critics. She is currently starring in the second season of The Real Housewives of Nairobi reality show. In this interview, she speaks about her achievements, setbacks, and the challenges of navigating public life in the digital age

1. Having been in the limelight for more than a decade, what would you consider your greatest achievement so far?I have done a lot that most people can relate to but being a mum is the greatest of them all. It's very special, especially being a mum to a boy and a girl. It is very exciting since I get to experience both sides. I love watching my children grow. I spend most of my time with them. I love taking care of them and I plan to give them the best life. And, I am not getting any more children. I need a break so that I can also enjoy life and do other things. If I ever add more children, it will be probably six or seven years from now.

2. Looking back at your pre-celeb life, in what ways do you feel the digital space has changed?I became famous after the local music scene embraced the video vixen culture. I was the talk of the town when I appeared on P-Unit’s You Guy video in 2012 because of my curves and confident demeanour. In 2014, I also appeared on rapper Prezzo’s video for the track My Gal, where I also took command of the video. Since then, I have continued to rise, and I believe I’ve become a role model for many.

For anyone who wants to become a socialite, my advice is, go for it. However, you must understand that it comes naturally and you can't force it. I did not choose to be famous, people made me famous when I showcased my skills publicly. Make sure you are natural. The world is too big and there is a place for everybody. I have been famous for over a decade so I know what I’m talking about. I have paved the way for all of them. Understand that social media is not kind so have a tough skin and have fun.

3. Why did you close your salon business?I did it in 2022 but I did not speak about it. The closure had nothing to do with me going bankrupt. It was because I moved back to Nairobi and I was involved in other things. I spent more time in Nairobi so it was hard to focus on a business when I was away.

You know, if something is not working, you don’t have to force it. Also, running a business is not easy. Even successful people have failed in business. There is nothing to be shy about a business not doing well. It doesn't mean that you are broke or that your life will not go on. You close it, open another one and life goes on, just a little less stressfully. Sometimes people hold on to things and they end up crashing.

4. What should your fans expect from Season Two of TRHoN?It is spicy, exciting and amazing. I feel like I got a bit wild this season since I am single, and there is also a bit of drama. Also, at some point, it will get emotional. My fans will also see another side of me as a mother of two. My son (Ice Brown) is also in this season and I love it. Being single is very good for me. Marriage was boring and there were things I could not do in Season One because my ex-husband (Brown Mauzo) was around. In Season Two, I am doing it with a lot of authenticity. I am also not pregnant like I was in Season One and that means I was able to do all the activities.

5. Are your frequent travels attributed to your new relationship with a foreign partner?Hahaha, I travel a lot because I get a lot of international gigs. This is exciting as I also like going on vacations abroad. I have not been visiting the boring countries. I have gone to all the fun countries where there is life and parties. I have been to over 30 states in the US. I am almost finishing the whole of America. Travelling is fun and super exciting and I can't wait for my children to grow up so that I can travel with them.

About my partner, I don’t want any commitment at the moment. I just want to have fun so the person I am with is not there for a serious relationship. I’m single because I don't want it to be serious…niko 50/50 one leg in, one leg out. I also don’t want him to be committed to me. He is Nigerian.

Sh2 million illegal sandalwood destroyed in Samburu,"Officials in Samburu on Thursday destroyed illegally logged sandalwood worth Sh2 million following a court order.

Some 300 kilos of the endangered tree species were burned in a ceremony led by Maralal Principal Magistrate, James Wanyanga, with top security officers from Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) also in attendance.

The logs, which had been impounded since last year, were destroyed at the Maralal Law Courts, where they had been preserved as exhibits.

Sandalwood, mostly found on community land in Samburu, is a fragrant yellowish heartwood with insect-repelling and medicinal properties.

Mr Wanyanga stated that although the cases were still ongoing in court, the destruction was undertaken to send a message to those involved in the illegal harvesting.

""The case involving these logs is still ongoing, but because we do not have a store to keep them, we decided to destroy them here. This exercise is also important because we want to send a message out there to those who are still dealing with the illegal business,"" said Mr Wanyanga.

Samburu Central Assistant County Commissioner, John Mutiso, said the government is doing everything possible to curb illegal sandalwood trade through the use of a multi-agency security team.

This team includes the National Police Service (NPS), Kenya Forest Service (KFS), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).

""We will intensify campaigns and patrols to curb this illegal harvesting of sandalwood. We have arrested suspects and charged them in court,"" Mr Mutiso said.

Experts note that sandalwood is used as a raw material in the production of perfumes and lotions and is often trafficked through porous borders to neighboring countries.

Mr Mutiso urged stakeholders to work together to check the illegal trade and put those involved on notice.

Detectives revealed that a network of hardcore individuals is behind the illegal business across the region. However, the government insists they have established ""a very strong joint security team"", and that no piece of sandalwood will be ferried past Samburu county borders.

Almost every part of the tree—leaves, stem, roots, and even bark—has economic value, turning traders into millionaires in Samburu.

Some leaders in the region have accused local security authorities of failing to end the illegal sandalwood trade, which is enriching unscrupulous businessmen. The tree is being harvested illegally in forest covers in Samburu County and other parts of the North Rift, including Pokot and Baringo counties.

"Biden, Trump agree on the dates of Presidential debate","US President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to face off in two debates on June 27 and September 10, setting up the highest stakes moments yet of the race for the White House.

""As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,"" Biden said on social media.

Trump called Biden ""the worst debater"" he has ever faced.

""I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September,"" he posted on social media.

CNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O, said the first debate would be held in their Atlanta studio with no audience, and would be moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Georgia is one of November's most closely contested states.

The candidates also accepted an invitation from ABC DIS.N, which will host a second debate on September 10.

A separate vice presidential debate has been proposed for July, after the Republican National Convention.

Key differences between the two sides remained on the terms of engagement. Biden said he would participate in those two debates under strict rules to reduce interruptions, while Trump called for more than two - and a very large venue ""for excitement purposes.""

Independent US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr claimed in a new post on X that he will meet the criteria to participate in the CNN debate before the June 20 deadline. It remained unclear if he will qualify.

CNN requires its debate candidates to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold and receive at least 15 per cent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed only 13 per cent of Americans would vote for Kennedy.

Earlier in the day Kennedy said Biden and Trump "" are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.""

Debates, which will draw a US live television audience in the tens of millions, are fraught with risks for both candidates, who face a tight race and low enthusiasm from voters.

Biden aides think debates could hurt Trump by exposing his positions on issues, including abortion, that they regard as political vulnerabilities.

Trump aides see Biden as prone to verbal slip-ups that could amplify voter concerns about the 81-year-old president's age. Trump will be 78 by the time the first debate is held.

""Both candidates will be under greater scrutiny than they have ever been due to their age,"" Alan Schroeder, a professor emeritus at Northeastern University who wrote the book ""Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trial."" He called the debate ""one of the only moments in which the candidates don't have complete control.""

The first debate would take place after the June 15 conclusion of the Group of Seven summit in Italy and Trump's criminal trial in New York.

Biden's debate proposal, the first formal offer by his campaign, ditched the decades-old tradition of three fall debates and called for direct negotiations between the Trump and Biden campaigns over the rules.

Asked about any preference for format or topics, Biden-Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said some details remained to be worked out.

The move to accept debates shows Biden is willing to take a calculated risk to boost his opinion poll numbers in a race in which he is trailing Trump in key battleground states. In addition to his age, voters remain concerned about Biden's handling of the economy.

Trump, who refused to debate his rivals during the Republican nominating race, has in recent weeks been challenging Biden to a one-on-one matchup with him, arguing that debates should be held before early voting begins in some states.

He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt the debate should be two hours and that both men should be required to stand.

Biden's team earlier requested that only broadcast networks that hosted Republican primary debates in 2016 and Democratic primary debates in 2020 be eligible to host this year.

Only four networks hosted debates for both parties during those election cycles: CNN, Telemundo CMCSA.O, CBS News and ABC News.

The Biden team showed no signs of accepting Trump's invitation for more debates. A Biden campaign spokesperson declined comment on the issue.

Biden said he would not take part in the traditional televised showdowns organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, rejecting the nonpartisan organization that has managed them since 1988.

Trump had also expressed interest in bypassing the commission, and the Republican National Committee announced in 2022 that the party would leave the commission's debate system altogether.

In a letter explaining the Biden campaign's decision, campaign chair Jennifer O'Malley Dillon cited the commission's past struggles to keep candidates from violating debate rules.

She notified the commission that Biden will not be participating in the three general-election debates sponsored by the group, which are scheduled for September 16, October 1 and October 9. The commission could not be reached for a comment.

""The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home — not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors, who consume valuable debate time with noisy spectacles of approval or jeering,"" Dillon said.

Biden's campaign also pressed for a debate that would occur before early voting started and without the participation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or any other independent or third-party candidates.

Football was my escape from a life of crime and drug abuse,"William Gitama, 19, is a fast-rising striker. He won the Golden Boot in the Costa Daurada Cup tournament in Barcelona, Spain last month with the Talanta Hela Under-19 boys team after scoring three goals in five matches, which helped Kenya win the title.

Last year, Gitama's talent shone bright during the Chapa Dimba and Talanta Hela tournaments where he was named the Most Valuable Player in the coastal region. Due to his impressive talent, he was admitted to top flight team Bandari FC.

Gitama grew up in Kisauni, Mombasa, an area that has consistently had a bad reputation for crime, drug abuse among youth and is home to teenage gangs.

How was your childhood? I grew up in Kisauni, Mombasa, and that has been my home for nearly two decades. My education began at Fahari Primary School, followed by a brief stint at St Anthony Boys Kitale where I stayed for two years before I transferred to Serani Boys High School in Mombasa.

It was my exceptional performance in sports that earned me a coveted scholarship to St Antony. I was scouted during the East Africa Primary School Games by coach Peter Mayoyo, who teaches Kiswahili at the school. During my time at St Anthony, I was honoured to receive a call-up to the national Under-17 team that played against Djibouti in a World Cup qualifier match played in Dar es Salaam in 2018 where we won 7-0.

I started playing football at the age of six and I have never looked back. I am grateful for the journey and the lessons it has taught me. I now know the importance of discipline and perseverance, and how to balance between the game and my studies. My parents and siblings have also been very supportive.

Now, as a Bandari FC player, I am working hard to contribute to the success of the club.

How was it growing up in Kisauni?In my childhood, I witnessed many friends abandon football at a young age to indulge in drugs, and some even fell victim to mob justice and died young. Sadly, this was a common occurrence in my neighbourhood. I am grateful that my talents steered me away from such activities.

People often point to idleness as the reason young people indulge in alcohol and drug abuse. They argue that an idle mind is the devil's workshop, and it is true. When young people find themselves with nothing to do, they may turn to drugs to alleviate boredom, seek excitement, or simply to pass the time. This pattern can hasten the path to addiction, as considerable time is spent on drug consumption. I am glad I found football to fill up my free time.

How did winning the Golden Boot award in Spain make you feel?Last season, I scored seven goals in six league matches for the Bandari youth team, but unfortunately I got an ankle injury that forced me out of action for three months. Coming from an injury and rising to top form was a huge blessing. The award came as a surprise. I just believed in myself and God. My dream is to play football in Europe, probable in Spain, a country that offers the best opportunities for football growth due to its modern facilities and the government’s huge investment in the sport.

Was it always your dream to join the Bandari senior team?Joining the Dockers was truly a dream come true. It wasn't an easy journey, I had to push myself hard on the pitch.I was extremely anxious when I joined the senior team. I can vividly recall my debut game for Bandari. It was against Nzoia Sugar at our home ground in Mbaraki, a match we won 2-1. I was introduced in the final moments of the game. The unfamiliar pitch, the atmosphere, and the huge crowd were all new to me.

I am deeply thankful to my coach John Baraza who has consistently encouraged me. He told me to have faith in myself and to always give my all on the field whenever I am given the chance to play.

What activities do you engage in during your leisure time? I enjoy playing Play Station (PS), a pastime that has significantly honed my football abilities.

What are your preferred dishes?I love Swahili food such as chapati and coconut beans (maharagwe ya nazi), biryani, and pilau.

What advice would you give to aspiring young footballers?Be you. Football is a lucrative profession, and I can attest to this as I am currently supporting my family through my earnings from the sport. Additionally, perseverance is key. I have witnessed some of my peers lose hope and abandon the sport due to challenging economic conditions yet they were very talented. Above all, maintain discipline and have faith in God.

‘Help me access treatment for this strange disease’,"Lying on a wooden bed in her grass-thatched, mud-walled house in Chekeneroi village, Siyoi ward in West Pokot County, a frail Evelyn Cherop groans in excruciating pain.

Her leaking roof and a window covered with black polythene papers may be the least of her concerns; the unknown disease that has confined her within the walls of her house is what bothers her.

Her health has been deteriorating daily and now she can neither walk nor stand on her own. But Cherop, 32, lacks money to seek medical attention. An orphan, she has battled with the unknown condition for the last 14 years but has never gone to any good hospital to seek medical help. She has been on painkillers throughout her life.

The disease manifests in swollen legs and joint pains in the whole body. In 2020, she started experiencing severe pains in her leg joints. The legs got swollen and she gradually became too weak and found it hard to stand, and has never walked since then.

Tired of life

She has sought treatment from nearby dispensaries and health centres, which have referred her to higher-level hospitals, but she says she cannot afford it.

“I don’t sleep at night, and I don’t know what I am suffering from,” says the mother of one. “I have suffered from youth into adulthood. I can’t walk or do anything. My hands and legs can’t stretch. I can’t imagine being in bed the whole of my life. I am now tired of life,” she said.

With the overwhelming odds and challenges against her, Cherop managed to clear her high school education at St Mary’s Siyoi Secondary School where she scored a C-. Growing up, she wanted to become a doctor.

Situation worsened

“Many times I failed to go to school when the situation worsened. I used to sit and rest along the road when going to school,” she explains. “I call on well-wishers, our leaders, and the government to help me get the treatment I need.”

“There is no day I concentrated well in class. I used to miss school and used a walking stick. At first, it was painful but it was not alarming. I would use painkillers that I got from the hospital to relieve the pain,” she says.

Cherop relies on her elder sister, does casual jobs to earn a living, for food. Their mother died in 2005. She feels she has become a burden to others.

“Imagine a life trapped inside your home, with serious health or mobility issues with no treatment or support in sight. I just sleep all day long, only changing sleeping positions,” she says.

Sick with pain

“My siblings carry me in and out of the house. Some have become sick with pain in their chests and are also tired. I just relieve myself wherever I am. They bathe me like a baby and I go for my long and short calls wherever I am,” she says.

Her niece, Nancy Chepsuto, who has been her helper, says carrying Cherop in and out of the house has been a difficult and cumbersome task. She says she has been using herbal medicine

“I cannot go out and look for work because we can’t leave her alone,” says Chepsuto.

A classmate, Garrison Topilla, says Cherop has been suffering since he knew her while in school. “It has been a painful journey. Sometimes she used to come late to school. It has been hard for the family.”

Another classmate, James Kamaru, says that on many days, Cherop would be unable to continue walking while heading to school.

“Sometimes we were forced to carry her to school,” he says.

Betty Adera: Serving communities at the grassroots enriches my life,"When we are ushered into Betty Adera’s home in Nairobi’s Loresho area, one thing immediately catches my attention - the documentation of memoirs and experiences through art, drawings and photos. Her walls are a museum of sorts.

Among other things, Ms Adera is a Global Public Health and Policy Specialist with over 22 years of Senior Management experience in both local and international NGOs. Currently, she is the Global Senior Technical Advisor for HIV/Aids, Health, and Nutrition at Global Communities, backstopping programmes in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.

She is also the founder of the Betty Adera Foundation, which collaborates with grassroots women and youth to champion girls' education, gender equality, and equity, as well as challenge all forms of gender-based violence.

Are you an artist or just a collector?

Well, I am not an artist myself, but my last-born son is so good at drawings. Some of his drawings are on these walls. But I am a collector, and that adds to the colour, life, and vibrance of our home. Whenever I travel to another country, which I do a lot, I must bring back a souvenir from that land and add it to the collection.

Speaking of travelling, you are currently in charge of four continents; how do you manage?

My role means working across several timelines. While I mostly operate from here in Nairobi, it also means that I have to ensure I am not falling behind on my deliverables, so it is not unusual for you to catch me at a work meeting at 3 am.

Where did your journey begin?

I grew up in a village called Wouth Ogik in Migori County. Wuoth Ogik in Dholuo means the “end of the journey or mwisho wa safari”. Coming from such a place if you are not careful, that name can easily define you. I had a normal childhood as the sixth of eight siblings born to teachers. This meant the discipline bar was set very high for us. My parents were disciplinarians, and some of the values they instilled in us, such as hard work, have stuck with me to this day and I instil the same in my sons. I especially remember my dad urging us all to study hard, as education was and still is the equalizer for all. He would be so proud to learn that by God’s grace, I am set to graduate with a PhD in Global Public Health from EUCLID University at some point this year.

What kind of sibling were you?

I was the snitch! I laugh when I remember this! I am the one who would always tell on my siblings to my dad and get them caned thoroughly. I had a great relationship with my dad. He passed away in 1986, but the memories I shared with him are just as fresh in my mind today. I am the only one who used to make his fried eggs - he loved my cooking, though I was very young. Though I got into trouble with my siblings for snitching, they would also use me if they needed anything from him, as he would hardly say no to me. So, it's sort of balanced.

How did you choose your career path?

I loved studying and was an equally bright student. I went to Migori Primary School, then qualified for Kenya High School, and later transitioned to the University of Nairobi (UoN), where I acquired a Bachelor's degree in Arts and Social Work and graduated in 1997. It was at the University of Nairobi that I knew I wanted to be a community-level person—a grassroots empowerment kind of person. By this time, I was married and a mother of one.

We then moved to Homabay Town, and because I did not want to sit idle after graduation, I approached a local high school in search of a teaching job. I approached the head teacher then and told him that I had no teaching qualifications by any standards, but I spoke good English. I was able to convince him and that is how I got my first job, earning Sh7,000. Looking back, the lesson I take away from this experience is do not despise humble beginnings; start somewhere and grow from there.

Ms  Betty Adera is a Global Public Health and Policy Specialist with over 22 years of Senior Management experience in both local and international NGOs.

How has the journey been?

Well, from my brief teaching experience, I moved into the core of development work, prioritising community-driven interventions in the health research and development spaces, coupled with supporting children and households made vulnerable by HIV/Aids/TB, mainly in Kenya and across several other African countries at Management levels.

I am also an actor in the Health Policy space within Maternal Child Health and Nutrition and Reproductive Health, having served in numerous National-level health-related technical working groups. These experiences have laid a strong foundation for my career trajectory, reflecting and learning every day and building into the specialist that I am today.

You are the recipient of several awards. Which one stands out the most for you?

(Rising up and carefully picking up one award from her trophy display.) This one is right here! It is the converted CEO’s award awarded to me by Global Communities in 2018. At that time, every two years, the CEO of the organisation would just decide whom to give the CEO Award of the Year. For the first time, the award came to Africa. I became the first African and first African Woman to win this award. It was and still is one of the greatest honours of my career life.

What was the motivation behind founding the Betty Adera Foundation?

I founded the foundation in 2017 because of two main things: I saw the need in the community and many people were coming to me with concerns about how to address Gender-based Violence (GBV), and secondly, due to my lived experiences. I took a step of faith and put together the initiative. So far, we have helped over 3,000 survivors of SGBV and GBV. Looking back, I wish I had started that foundation much earlier.

What are some of the lessons that you have picked along the way?

Being a woman in leadership is not easy. You have to work twice as hard to prove that you are capable of fulfilling your responsibilities. While this has been a challenge, I have learnt to be my cheerleader and a believer in my voice. That way, I can confidently defend my thoughts and what I believe in. I have also come to appreciate the power of being kind and giving back. I have come to learn that giving comes with so much satisfaction and blessings.

What does the future look like for you?

I hope to have my Doctorate thesis published and I would also like to author books going forward. I am currently 50 years old and I am soon going to be an empty nester, so I also have plans to take on superfoods farming and put up a mental wellness centre to respond to the unique needs of adolescents and young people.

What’s your favourite meal to eat and make?

I love ugali. I can have ugali with no accompaniment. When I travel outside Kenya, I tell my sons to make sure they have prepared ugali before coming to pick me up from the airport. Chapatis are my favourite to make and I make really good ones, though I am not a fan of eating them. Even when we go to the village for Christmas or a family gathering, cooking chapatis is always left to me. I am fast and I make a lot of them in an incredibly short time.

"Landslides, floods kill three and destroy property in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet","Two people died after being buried by landslides in Elgeyo Marakwet County while another was swept away by raging waters in West Pokot as floods caused by heavy rains.

The duo died while scores of others were injured after landslides hit Chesoi village in Marakwet East, damaging several houses and crops.

""The injured have been taken to hospital while rescue operations are ongoing to assess the extent of damage and losses suffered by families,"" said Oscar Okumu, Kenya Red Cross Society Head of North Rift Region.

In West Pokot County, one person was killed by floods while two schools were destroyed and 300 sheep lost after a landslide hit Chepkaram village in Tapach, Pokot South sub-County, damaging infrastructure, several roads and submerging several acres of food crops.

Kiamakeo Assistant Chief Michael Loreng said the body was found floating in the Chesra River on Thursday.

The body of a male adult, estimated to be around 60 years old, was recovered from the river and taken to the Kapenguria County Referral Hospital mortuary.

The floods also damaged Chepkalit Primary and Secondary Schools, casting doubt on their reopening on Monday.

""We were eagerly anticipating the reopening of school on Monday, but now our hopes have been dashed by this unforeseen calamity. Our classrooms are flooded and our learning materials have been destroyed,"" lamented Fred Ngolepus, a parent.

The reopening of schools, which had been eagerly awaited by both students and teachers, is now hanging in the balance as authorities scramble to assess the extent of the damage and devise a course of action to deal with the aftermath of the disaster.

West Pokot County Director of Education, Simon Wamae, expressed grave concern over the devastating impact of the floods on Chepkalit Secondary and Primary Schools.

He appealed for support to rebuild the damaged institutions to facilitate a smooth learning process.

""The school will not open because it has been badly destroyed by the floods,"" he said.

Mr Wamae called for concerted efforts to reduce future risks from natural disasters.

""Our priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our learners and staff. We are assessing the damage and implementing the recovery process,"" Mr Wamae said.

"Buffaloes, Rhinos face-off in Rugby Super Series second round","Kabras Sugar Buffaloes and Faiba Mobile Rhinos have rung changes in their squads ahead of their clash in the second round of the Rugby Super Series today at the Nakuru Athletic Club.

KCB Lions and Menengai Cream Cheetahs, who won their first-round matches, face off in the other second-round game at the same venue.

Favourite Buffaloes stunningly went down 18-5 to Cheetahs while Rhinos fell prey to the Lions, losing 29-7 in the first-round matches played last Saturday at RFUEA ground.

Head coach Max Adaka has made seven changes to the Buffaloes squad that lost to Cheetahs, bringing in hooker Geoffrey Shitambasi for Gibson Perez, second row Hillary Odhiambo for Jacktone Omondi and eighth man Gabriel Adero for Biden Hayo.

In the backline, scrum-half Collins Osore comes in for Dan Ang’wech, while Centres Darrel Brantana and Brian Kiptanui replace Alvin Mutach and Bede Enonda. Fullback Samwel Omollo comes in for James Olela.

Catholic University

“We had to give some playtime to some players, especially from Catholic University like hooker Jeremy Odhiambo and prop Emmanuel Otieno, who will start on the bench and eighth man Gabriel Adero, who will start,” said Adaka.

“We must win this match and the last one in Kakamega against the Lions to finish top or second for the final duel,” explained Adaka.

Rhinos deputy coach Oliver Callum, who has six changes to his squad, has roped in Kenya Under-20 scrum-half Patrick Wainaina but will start from the bench.



Callum has preferred Mohamed Khedir over Abel Matanda at prop, while second-row John Aswani and flanker Laban Kipsang’ come in for Stanslous Shikoli and Barnabas Owuor, respectively.

Arnold Muita replaces Ian Mumbwani, while Ervin Asena retains his fly-half position in the backline.

Hosts Cheetahs coach Lawrence Buyachi and his Lions counterpart Oliver Mang’eni have kept faith in the squads that won last Saturday, making minimal changes ahead of the “Cats” battle.

Kenya Simbas utility back row Elkeans Mukamiti comes in for Samuel Were, while Kenya Under-20 winger Alvin Khavoli replaces Samwel Macharia in Buyachi’s only changes.

Quinto Ongo moves from the right wing to fullback to accommodate Khavoli.

Mang’eni, who has brought in Patrick Ouko for Wilhite Mususi at prop, has put his trust in the likes of Barthes Trophy-winning captain Andy Cole Omollo, among others.

Lions top the standings with five points after their bonus-point victory against Rhinos. The Cheetahs are second with four points, while the Buffaloes and Rhinos are pointless in third and fourth places.

The Rugby Super Series received a significant boost on Wednesday when mobile phone service provider, Jamii Telecom (JTL) supported the event to the tune of Sh4 million.

From the package, Sh1.5 million is in cash, while the remaining Sh2.5 million will go towards branding as JTL took charge of the Rhinos. In addition, the company will provide internet connectivity during the Rugby Super Series.

The games will be played at the Nakuru Athletic Club. Tickets go for Sh500 for regular, Sh200 for parking and Sh2,000 for VIP (parking included).

Virginity: We're waiting until marriage despite peer pressure,"A few years ago, the value placed on virginity by society, especially on young women, was huge. Those who were not virgins as brides were pariahs. But as the world becomes liberal, so does our culture.

Few find joy in waiting. The average age of sex debut in Kenya now starts from 16, according to the latest Kenya Demographic and Health Survey report, with marriage starting at 21 years. Younger generations are now talking more openly about sex, be it with their peers or oversharing on social media. Late starters are ridiculed.

MyNetwork spoke to four young adults on their take on the value of virginity in modern society.

As a Muslim, I believe we should value virginity just the way our grandparents and great-grandparents did.

It was such an honour for a woman to keep herself until marriage. From a young age, I was taught the importance of staying pure until marriage and the benefits, which include earning a partner’s respect. I also believe that a couple is more likely to maintain a peaceful marriage if they know that their relationship started when they were virgins. They get to enjoy a special, memorable moment. It will be easier for them to remain faithful to each other. Young Muslims are always told not to engage in haram relationships, even if there is pressure to do so.

A couple was expected to lie on white bedding the night after the wedding. This was used to test for virginity.

However, things have changed. The excitement and anticipation that came whenever a woman got married, with in-laws waiting by the door to pick up the bedsheets the next morning after the honeymoon night to confirm that she was a virgin, is slowly fading away.

Read: When virginity is not a measure of morality

Currently, this practice is only upheld by old people. They seem to be the only ones who believe that one should remain a virgin until marriage. I am not sure if we should blame the elders for not teaching their children the importance of virginity or blame the younger generations for failing to uphold their parents’ values and principles.

Nowadays, adults who are virgins are considered immature or too conservative by their peers. This is especially the case for younger men. Some of them are eager to sleep with as many women as possible. There is a lot of pressure on young women to lose their virginity too.

I have also heard men say that they would never marry a virgin because they have no ‘experience’.

Some women brag on social media, boldly, about having had several men and flaunting the numbers as if it were an achievement. This peer pressure makes some feel left out, a sad reality.

As a young woman, I still hold my virginity in very high regard, perhaps because of my upbringing. I am incredibly conscious of the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.

Homa Bay is one of the counties leading in HIV/Aids infections and teen pregnancies, and I believe that some of the cases can be prevented through abstinence.

I would like to advise younger people to abstain until marriage. There is no honour in having an early sexual debut.

It only leads to guilt and remember, once you engage in sexual activities, stopping might not be easy.

Our elders should also place more emphasis on cultural teachings like the Madrassa classes for Muslims.

Abstinence can be challenging, but it is a choice one should make. Self-respect, sexual purity, and adhering to spiritual and cultural beliefs can greatly encourage youth to embrace abstinence.

However, I do not believe that virginity should be the primary reason for considering or rejecting a potential partner.

One of the things that will help encourage abstinence is for parents to have honest discussions about sexuality with their children.

This will uphold the values of purity, self-control, and the sanctity of the marital bond.

To date, people who manage to keep themselves until marriage are respected.

Abstinence is a sign of self-discipline and self-respect. The delayed gratification sets the stage for a more meaningful and fulfilling relationship.

But we all know that not everyone values virginity, and this is a sad truth.

The behaviour change has been influenced by societal influences, including exposure to media and a lack of comprehensive sex education from parents and other trusted sources.

This has come with harsh consequences. The results of early sexual acts include loss of self-respect, the risk of early pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases.

However, all is not lost. I believe that providing age-appropriate sex education to children is crucial. We need to let children know from an early age that their sexuality is important and that irresponsible choices could lead to diseases and even death.

This should be accompanied by open and honest discussions about the long-term benefits of abstinence.

I think our parents are the last generation to place a high value on sexual purity, especially for women. My generation views sex differently: as a way of spending free time.

My take is that virginity is not necessarily a measure of a happy marriage. I would prefer to connect intimately with my potential spouse before marriage.

I know that this was shunned and unheard of in the past, especially in my culture, where there are lots of taboos about premarital sex.

Intimacy was sacred. A virgin would attract a hefty bride price and bring honour to her home. Those who did not preserve their purity were seen as an embarrassment, and at times the family would disown them.

This went a long way in discouraging both boys and girls from premarital sex. There were very few cases of single parenthood or children born out of wedlock.

Read: I'll hold on to my virginity till marriage and I'm urging girls to remain pure as well

Currently, peer pressure, lack of adequate parental guidance, early and unlimited exposure to adult content and lack of timely sex education have made it hard for young people to practice abstinence.

This has led to an increase in cases of abortion, STIs, and single parenthood. You gain a lot by delaying your sexual life. Look at a growing generation of bitter young women who have been left to take care of their children single-handedly.

If we are not careful, our world will soon be full of broken relationships with confused children who do not even understand what is going on.

It is high time we started promoting comprehensive sex education. For me, I will engage my children in sex education as early as possible because I believe that an educated mind makes better decisions.

Consider the potential consequences of your actions and prioritise your physical and emotional well-being. Talk openly with trusted adults.

I blame society for watering down the value of virginity. People around us expect women to remain virgins until marriage, but men are not judged by the same standards.

If a man decides to sow wild oats, it is considered normal. That is where we all got it wrong. In a world where irresponsible sexual activities can cause deadly diseases, one needs to abstain until marriage.

I also believe that whoever can abstain from sexual activities until marriage, whether male or female, automatically earns respect.

As a woman, you earn so much respect and confidence, not just for yourself but also for your family. They will be revered for raising you well. The best part of getting married as a virgin is that even your husband will speak highly of you.

We are, however, in an era where young people are not interested in keeping their virginity.

Celibacy is unusual. Young people are looking for fun, and I dare say that is the reason they keep moving from one relationship to the next.

Peer pressure and easy access to mobile phones and the internet are other reasons for the moral decay of society.

Read: New York considers 'virginity test' ban after uproar

Parents often give their children phones but pay little or no attention to how the gadget is used, yet social media has no filters and does not care whether one is a child or an adult. Let us also not forget that young people are very curious and try out what they see.

Another major gap is the lack of sex education. Many adults are unwilling to tell the youth what they need to know and instead tell them what they want to hear. When they make mistakes, we start blaming them.

The result is that so many young adults are living with guilt. There are lots of broken relationships and homes.

To get back on track, sexual education is key. I attended many sexual education classes organised by a non-government organisation back in school. We were taught about the different types of STIs and how to avoid contracting them. The lessons helped me. I knew where to draw the line. I was able to say “no” whenever I needed to.

"Ivy Namu: I left my law studies and focused on content creation, for that is my passion","Ivy Namu, a content creator, burst into the spotlight four years ago amid rumours of a romantic relationship with media personality Willis Raburu. Before she became popular, Ivy says she cherished her private life as she could walk around and dress as she pleased. Today, she opens up about navigating stardom, reshaping her brand, and her decision to abandon a promising law career

1. As a public figure, what forms of cyberbullying have you ever experienced?Social media is not a very friendly space. In 2022 I was trolled for an outfit I had worn to the Wakanda film premiere. I had delivered my second child Yara just five months before that and I was so excited to go watch the movie and be out for a couple of hours. I dressed up like a good mum and felt good about myself. You know the lack of body positivity you get after giving birth…you feel chubby and all that. I made a reel and posted it on my TikTok. I then slept only to wake up and find myself trending on TikTok when I woke up. People were saying I was the worst dressed person for that occasion. I remember wondering what was wrong with my outfit because I felt fine in it.

I just switched off my comments and blocked some toxic people. It didn't get to me so much but I restricted any further reactions. There was also a challenge with my relationship at the time and at some point I felt like I needed to just quit the internet and be quiet. It took a while to fight back the negativity from people who didn't know me. I decided to focus on the positive side of things.

2.How did your life change when you started dating famous TV presenter Willis Raburu?To be honest, I was afraid to date Willis because his divorce was in the public domain. Again, I feel like God got back at me because I knew what I was getting myself into. I was prepared since the people who mattered to me knew my truth and I didn't need to defend myself, so I fell in love and the rest is history.I would say I have learnt the value of privacy. When you are not in public, you take for granted the fact that you can walk anywhere and do anything and nobody cares. I had to learn to be keen about everything I say on social media, what I post and even how I react because it is no longer about just me and my family anymore. Now, when I go somewhere and nobody takes a picture of me, that is a good day for me.

My privacy was compromised and even now I have had to consciously reduce the number of pictures I post with my children, even though I am very proud of them and I like posting pictures of them. I am always afraid that tweeps may attack. But that space has also allowed me to experience a lot of love and support from people I don't even know.

3..As a mother, you seem incredibly focused on maintaining your health and well-being. Can you share with us your approach to health and how it influences your role as a parent?Moving from feeding for two to being conscious about what I eat has been my main goal. I also exercise a lot. I have decided to become intentional about it because birthing and raising children is not an easy task. My second pregnancy is what puffed me up and I got to about 80 kilogrammes, from about 55kgs. I got to a point where people could not recognise me. Now, I keep introducing myself to people after pregnancy since I have lost so much weight. I am about 60kg and I aim to be healthy, although I am not so obsessed with cutting weight.

About motherhood, I am taking it day by day and I love it. Watching my children start school gives me confidence. The secret about this journey is to be kind on yourself. My children have taught me a lot as a mother. I have two children under two years and balancing between my career aspirations and time spent with them has been hard. I had to deal with a lot of mum guilt and I had to spend time with both.

4. You have mentioned singing, tell us about your music journey and why you quit your law studies…I am the first musician in our family. I used to sing in primary and high school. Most of my classmates thought I would become a musician immediately but I decided to take law as a career to make my parents happy. I studied law at Catholic University of Eastern Africa so that I could be away from home. I did the course for three and a half years and I quit. I had scored a B plain in high school despite always being in trouble.

The course got overwhelming and I was always sad. At the time, I didn't know much about anxiety, but I was not okay. I decided to take a break at first for one year and then when I went back I felt like the course wasn't in my heart anymore. The main reason I was feeling that was because I didn't feel like I was doing what I wanted. After I quit, I went to music school and that is also where I started doing social media management and digital strategy. That is how I ended up at Royal Media Services.

The law studies have helped me navigate both the entertainment industry and the digital space. I am able to read my contracts and negotiate for better perks which the law affords me. I have been recording music and I will be releasing an album later this year. I sing contemporary RnB music about kindness and being good to people. I have also written love songs, and songs about the environment. I know I can sing well and I can't wait to share my talent with the world.

5.  Describe your dream wedding.Our wedding will happen but we might not post photos anywhere. It will be a very intimate affair with people I love and also, it will be an experience. My husband and I are an experience. We will have the best moments during our wedding. We will dance and entertain our guests. Close friends and family who stood by us when we were harshly discussed online will be given first priority. My engagement happened during my son's first birthday in July 2022. I had planned for the event only to be surprised. My best part was Nviiri singing and when I saw him, I knew Willis was going to propose because Mae Wendi is our song.

Ewaso Ng'iro River conservation efforts receive Sh10m boost,"The Dutch government has launched a partnership with community-based organisations in the Ewaso Ng'iro Basin to rehabilitate the degraded water source.

As part of the initiative, Water Resource Users Associations (WRUAs) and Community Forest Associations (CFAs) from Laikipia, Isiolo, Meru and Nyandarua counties have received a grant of Sh10 million to strengthen their conservation efforts.

The cheque was handed over by Dutch Deputy Ambassador Jolis Van Bommel to officials of the Mount Kenya Ewaso Water Partnership (MKWEP) at the Laikipia Governor's office in Nanyuki town.

World Wildlife Fund

The money, channelled through the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), will address governance and financial challenges that have rendered most of the 30 registered WRUAs in the region inactive.

WRUAs and CFAs are community-based legal entities recognised by the government to conserve water catchments and protect water sources.

However, they have not been able to adequately fulfil their mandates and, despite their existence, human activities such as encroachment and illegal water abstraction continue.

WRUA national chairperson Julius Kiriinya said the funds would, among other things, support the deployment of conservation scouts, noting that government agencies have failed to enforce existing laws enacted to protect water sources.

""We continue to witness massive encroachment on riparian areas in the Ewaso Ngíro Basin, such as farming, construction of structures and establishment of car garages, all of which have a negative impact on the flow of the river,"" Mr Kiriinya said.

The WRUA official noted that more than 100 rivers in the country have dried up in the last 40 years and if harmful human activities are not curbed and people continue to blame climate change, it will be a matter of time before the remaining 66 rivers also dry up.

In recent years, there has been massive lobbying for the conservation of the Ewaso Ng'iro River, the main source of water in semi-arid northern Kenya, which is fed by tributaries from the Mt Kenya and Aberdare forests.

EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story cited Sh30 million as the amount of money channelled to the organisation. It has been brought to our attention that the amount is Sh10m. The error is regretted.

Floods from Uganda displacing families in Turkana,"For more than two decades, Agnes Akuwom, 45, and her husband John Kebo, 51, have called Tobong’u Loree village home.

The couple has sired eight children with the firstborn daughter already married with two children.

Their home though 100 meters from the banks of seasonal Kawalase River that draws most of its water from slopes of hills and mountains in neighbouring Uganda’s Karamoja region, has never flooded to such a point that they have had to move out.

“We have always relocated to higher ground at Nataparikakono primary school and return after water levels subside. However, on Saturday at around noon, Lodwar town and its environs had not experienced rainfall for two days but floods from the river swallowed up several houses including ours,” Ms Akuwom narrated.

The floodwater that was more than five feet deep submerged more than 100 houses. Villagers who had been on high alert salvaged some of their property.

“Usually, the water level would be no more than two feet high and would subside just after two hours, but it appears that the river flooded at night after the heavy rain,” she added.

The couple, together with other 197 families, occupy a camp established by the Kenya Red Cross (KRS) and the Turkana County government at an unoccupied rehabilitation and counselling centre for people affected by alcohol and drug abuse in Nataparikakono village.

The Nation team found her mid-Sunday morning preparing black tea for her family outside her tent as she waited for relief food to be trucked in.

“As a family, we have decided to relocate from our ancestral home where my parents were buried. I plead with the government to get us a sizeable land where we can rebuild our lives because going back will be a death sentence for us,” Mr Kebo said.

He said they are tired of moving in with relatives and/or friends whenever the river gets flooded but this time round they resolved not to.

“At the camp, we were counselled by Kenya Red Cross staff over our decision and even though we don’t have a reliable source of food or even mosquito nets, we were assured of support with time,” Mr Kebo added.

The Nation also found Asha Ajikon who has decided never to return to her ancestral home. He weaves together a patchwork of cement bags to forge an additional tent for her temporary structure that has to accommodate her family and all her belongings.

Deputy Governor John Erus confirmed that three people have died as a result of floods across the county, 1,381 livestock lost and over 1,400 people displaced.

“We have identified three potential sites in the county where with support from the national government and development partners we intend to relocate all people affected by floods after proper verification,” Dr Erus said.

He warned residents against returning to their marooned homes as they lie on a riparian zone - near seasonal rivers Kawalase and Tarach as well as Turkwel River that will definitely flood in case Turkwel Hydroelectric Dam fills up.

“We will ensure that the displaced people get access to basic health services through mobile medical outreaches, dignity kits, water through our trucks, and their children get playing and educational materials,” Dr Erus said.

Turkana County Government has provided 100 bags of maize and 20 cartons of vegetable oil (100 litres apiece) to the affected households.

In addition to the food distribution at Nataparkakono village, the County Government through the Directorate of Disaster Risk Management has been conducting daily assessments across the high-risk 156 villages.

The County Government is working with Welthungerhilfe and Unicef through the KRS to support displaced households with non-food items in Nataparkakono, Lokangae, Todonya’ng, Kerio Delta, and Kalapata.

Lodwar Township MCA Ruth Kuya called on the County Government to provide all victims of the flooding with food and appoint health officers to attend to them to reduce potential health hazards. She also urged the community to use the provided toilets to minimise the risks of cholera through contamination.

Kenya Red Cross Society Coordinator for Turkana County, Rukia Abubakar emphasised the need for continued joint assessment and community sensitisation on risks associated with floods.

How Kuscco top bosses siphoned Sh580m annually,"Top executives of Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (Kuscco) siphoned Sh587.6 million annually over a decade, in a series of transactions including transferring money to their own accounts and tapping unsupported loans, plunging members into multi-billion shillings loss.

A government-backed special audit on Kuscco has revealed the executives rode on weak internal management structure to manipulate books of accounts and carry out the irregular transactions that cumulatively cost the society over Sh6.56 billion between February 2013 and April 2024.



Audit and advisory firm Grant Thornton, which scrutinised Kuscco’s books, has disclosed misappropriation of members’ funds through illegal withdrawals, cash transfers and engagement in illegal or unlicensed activities, ostensibly steered by top officials.

Kuscco was registered in 1973 as an umbrella lobby institution for Saccos, before morphing into an unregulated deposit-taking operation with different subsidiaries including Kuscco Mutual Assurance and Kuscco Housing.

Currently, Kuscco has a membership of about 4,168 Saccos, and holds deposits estimated at Sh18.9 billion.

Cooperatives and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui said on Monday he had dismissed Kuscco’s entire board and pledged to recover the lost billions in fresh efforts to save the struggling firm.

“Preliminary findings indicate systemic deficiencies in the management of resources, including the creative and unreliable financial records,” Mr Chelugui told reporters during a media briefing at his office yesterday.

“We will pursue all those culpable, all those that are involved, those who will be mentioned, until we recover every shilling owed to Kuscco members.”

The special audit was ordered by the ministry in January this year, after it was established that Kuscco’s books had been audited by unlicensed entities for the last two years, the period when it came under financial distress.



The ministry had ordered an inquiry into the activities of Kuscco by the Commissioner of Cooperatives in October last year, on suspicion that it had been engaging in illegal deposit-taking business, sparked by its inability to meet its financial obligations.

Initial findings had revealed that Kuscco had been commingling union funds between different programmes, including housing and insurance, without clear terms, and consequently was not able to release member deposits.

The Grant Thornton audit has shown there were high cash withdrawals of Sh5.47 billion between February 2013 and April 2024, which averages Sh40.79 million monthly. The auditor termed the cash withdrawal “out of character”, suggesting they were irregular and abnormal.

This included suspicious transfers worth Sh318.16 million that were made to the company secretary of Kuscco Housing.

Senior Kuscco staff and directors tapped loans amounting to Sh61.5 million, with Sh50 million going to the group managing director, Sh7 million to the head of Kuscco Housing Co-operative and Sh4.5 million directed to the company secretary of Kuscco Housing Society.

The audit further showed there were cash transfers to the personal accounts of three executives, with one top manager receiving Sh67.04 million, with two of his assistants getting Sh118.05 million and Sh15.99 million respectively.

In mid-January, Kuscco, without giving reasons, announced it had parted ways with its long serving chairman George Magutu and group managing director George Ototo.

Grant Thornton scrutiny also revealed that there was a double purchase of the same land at Sh80.55 million. There was also a Sh434.16 million suspicious cash transfer to insurance agencies.

According to Mr Chelugui, the irregular cash transfers to unnamed insurance agencies were “purported to be payment of commissions for services rendered to insurance services.”

Kuscco officials have also been found to have moved money between subsidiaries without following procedure.

According to the audit, Kuscco opened and operated a Fosa-Kusasa, which was neither a registered Fosa nor a microfinance. The officials rode on Kusasa to open an irregular account under Kuscco CIF, where customers’ cheques were received, endorsed and deposited at the Kuscco account for clearing.

Mr Chelugui said yesterday despite Kuscco incurring losses, it proceeded to declare bonuses, dividends and interests to members against the industry practice that only allows for such when an entity posts profits.

He said in light of the “egregious lapses” discovered after the audit, a consultative meeting convened on April 25, 2024 with representatives from depositors reached a unanimous decision to dismiss Kuscco’s entire board.

“It was concluded that the current board of directors has failed in its duty to steer the union effectively. Consequently, in the interest of ensuring accountability and restoring confidence, the ministry has taken a decisive action on this matter,” said Mr Chelugui.

He has directed the Commissioner for Cooperative Development to appoint an interim board of 15 members from affiliate cooperative, to oversee the “transformation and rehabilitation” of the union.

According to the ministry, Kuscco is registered as a lobby group for Saccos in Kenya, but is not in itself licensed to engage in the business of taking deposits and giving loans.

Why men hate therapy,"

In this episode, we delve into the complex and often misunderstood topic of why many men struggle with the idea of seeking therapy. Despite the increasing awareness of mental health issues, there remains a significant stigma attached to therapy, particularly among men.

Remembering ‘Papa Lolo' hit composer-Mose Fan Fan- five years on,"For many fans, relatives and former colleagues of legendary Congolese guitarist Mose Fan Fan (Se Sengo), Friday was an important day as they marked the fifth anniversary of his death.

In Kenya where Mose collapsed and died in Nairobi on May 3, 2019, most of his fans will particularly remember him for his composition of the ever-popular Papa Lolo hit song. With no major live shows organised in his honour, most fans are expected to celebrate his music online.

Speaking to Saturday Nation earlier this week from London Ms Angelique Bliungwa Nsanga, Mose's widow said she still cherished his musical prowess and particularly applauded his Kenyan fans for the love of his music.

“Kenya remains an important part in his musical journey as it was not only where he passed on but one of his greatest songs Papa Lolo was liked most, "" she said.

Similarly, she said she would join his fans online to celebrate his music.

At the time of his death, he was on a production tour of Kenya, to produce some of his new and old songs. Notably, a remix of Dje melasi, which he composed while with the legendary TPOK Jazz band led by Franco Luambo Makiadi in 1973.

The song was a dedication to his Kinshasa-based partner -Sidonie Djemalas, with whom Mose also had a daughter.

Nairobi-based producer Tabu Osusa of Ketebel Music was in charge of Mose's last production which was to culminate with a visit to Arusha, Tanzania. This is where he had been scheduled to team up with veteran Dar-based Congolese singer Tshimanga Assosa for recordings of new songs.

To most of Mose’s East African fans, Tanzania is important as it was his first stopover from Zambia after relocating from DR Congo in the late 1970s.

It was from Tanzania that he relocated to the UK through Kenyan in the early 1980s after having performed with Dar groups like Orch Makassy.

Notably, he was able to play the solo guitar style similar to that of his former band leader Franco Luambo Makiadi.

After Mose’s departure from TP OK Jazz, it was Thierry Mantuika Kobi who replaced him as a stand-in guitarist for Franco during live shows. Mose’s death was a double blow to Rhumba fans as it came just two days before his former counterpart in TP OK Jazz Lutumba Simaro was due to be laid to rest in Kinshasa..

In Kenya, Mose’s fans will recall the Papa Lolo tour of 2016, when he toured Kenya alongside UK-based Tanzanian musician Saidi Kanda, singer Nzaya Nzayadio, Congolese guitarist and producer Fiston Lusambo and fellow guitarist Douglas Kibs. Kenyan saxophone player Ken Makokha of the Ulinzi Orchestra band fame was among those who accompanied them during this tour.

Soldiering on after death of Ohangla maestro Abenny Jachiga,"In total contrast to the drama that characterised his burial, activities at the home of the late Ohangla musician Abenny Jachiga in Kadiju village in Chiga, Kisumu East, have been dormant.

For close to four years now, his 28-year-old widow Belinda Aluoch says they have had to contend with the prevailing circumstances as she struggles to make ends meet after the life of the promising artist was nipped at the peak of his musical career.

“Even though the majority of Kenyans have forged ahead without the man remembered for his stimulating Ohangla love songs, the family is yet to adjust to the new norm,” she said as we settled for an interview at her Chiga home.

While listening to his ‘Mano Kasinde’ hit song might be reassuring to his ardent fans, the composition elicits some mixed reactions from the wife and her two young children.

“As a family, we were not given ample time to mourn and give him a befitting send-off as we would have expected,” said Ms Belinda when we caught up with her for the interview at her home.

Within a few hours after developing breathing complications at his home in Chiga on June 10, 2020, Jachiga whose real name is Bernard Obonyo succumbed to pneumonia after being admitted at St Jairus Hospital in Kisumu.

To contain the prevalence of Covid-19 pandemic at the time, the Ministry of Health and the Kisumu County government issued regulations that, among others, capped the number of mourners at 15 and stipulated that burial should be conducted within 48 hours.

However, in total disregard of the laid down regulations, thousands of his fans turned out in their numbers and demanded that the burial be postponed to give them time to give the musician a decent burial.

The day-long chaotic scene forced the police who were overwhelmed to fire gunshots and tear gas to disperse the crowd as strangers took over the casket.

Amidst all the confusion and melee, the family was not spared as the police faced a difficult time in trying to enforce Covid rules.

The police were forced to bury 'Mano Kasinde' hit-maker in the dead of the night in an event witnessed by his younger brother Austin Omondi.

The next morning, the mother and the widow had to sit on the grave to plead with the mourners who stormed the home and threatened to exhume the body to accord him a befitting burial.

However, the unfortunate outcome wretched the emotions of the mother as she tried to come to terms with the loss of her sole breadwinner.

She did not live to celebrate the first anniversary of her son and passed on 11 months later.

In a twist of fate, Monica Auma faced the same destiny after developing breathing complications and succumbed three days later, says Ms Belinda.

“She got badly affected and breathed her last on my hand, just after arriving at the home of one of the local religious leaders where she requested to be taken,"" recalled the teary Belinda.

In the spirit of keeping the legacy of her husband alive, Ms Belinda at some point attempted to engage in composing Ohangla music but could not move forward after failing to get resources to record her debut song.

""Even though I have some passion, I realised that I was not able to fund the same and I have given up on that,"" she said.

To make ends meet, Ms Belinda practices peasant farming and is also involved in selling second-hand clothes at the busy Kibuye market and her village market in Chiga.

""With the little that I get, I have been able to provide for my family and progressively do some finishing works in my house,"" says the mother of two.

While well-wishers assisted the family in completing the construction of the house after the death of Jachiga in 2020, some final touches are yet to be done.

She however appreciates that she is able to earn some royalties from her husband's songs through Safaricom's Skiza Tunes.

But the spirit of Jachiga could be rekindled through his last-born son who has developed some interest in taking over the father's mantle in the music industry.

Whenever his song hits the airwaves, the eight-year-old is able to sing along the lines of 'Mano Kasinde' song that catapulted Jachiga to fame.

The song enumerates how people lie when caught with their partners and when they are hanging out with their cousins.

Jachiga is also famed for other songs such as 'Penzi ni Kama Yai' and 'Mano Maraga Odagi' which became a hit when the Supreme Court nullified the election of former President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017.

"Monitor dams, enlighten Kenyans on safety","It is disheartening that the death toll from flood-related incidents is almost 200 in just a month, making it imperative for the government to proactively safeguard dams to prevent tragedies.

For example, on April 27, at least 48 lives were lost in a flash flood that destroyed homes in Maai Mahiu after a dam burst with residents reported missing. Proper maintenance and monitoring of dams is thus crucial.

The government should declare the flooding situation as a serious national disaster. The ongoing unpredictable heavy downpours and flooding countrywide have resulted in significant damage and tragic loss of life among citizens. Thus the urgency for the government to prioritise this issue to prevent more deaths and displacement.

Floods have paralysed business operations at the heart of the economy, particularly in Nairobi, where cases have surpassed 30. Some have been forced to shut down as floods made the premises inhabitable. The havoc has extended to JKIA, disrupting operations with huge economic losses.

It is imperative that the government invest in water harvesting plans during the rainy season and educate the public on how to effectively manage water resources during the dry season, particularly for irrigation.

Many Kenyans have been displaced with the Government Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura indicating that more than 130,000 people have been rendered homeless. The government should establish more rescue centres for the flood victims.

It is crucial that Kenyans be educated on the risks of residing near river banks, dams and waterways generally. For their safety, the authorities should relocate the vulnerable to higher ground.

In light of the current situation, it is essential that proactive measures be to protect the well-being of the displaced. That way, we can absolutely work towards preventing further tragedies and ensuring the security and well-being of Kenyans.

"Firm's cheaper, seamless solution to cross border pay services nightmare","While operating from the United Kingdom, entrepreneurs Ola Oyetayo and Anthony Oduu encountered challenges in sending money to their associates back in Africa; this impeded the growth of their business.

Most of the available cross-border payment service providers would charge high transaction fees that affected their profitability. These fees ranged between three and five per cent of the transaction value.

The available payment solutions were also very slow, as service providers had not specialised in offering cross border payment services, leaving the entrepreneurs in need of a quicker solution.

“In markets such as Nigeria and Kenya, businesses that transacted large amounts of money would have to wait up to 24 hours to receive payments, while in less advanced markets, this could go up to seven days,” noted Mr Oyetayo in an interview with Powering SMEs.

The entrepreneurs also discovered that businesses trading in key African currencies encountered strict foreign currency transaction limits, which limited their growth and access to international markets.

In 2017, while unwinding over a regular game of poker, the two friends resolved to create a solution dubbed Verto, that would simplify cross-border payments in emerging markets, particularly Africa.

They quit their jobs, then approached some venture capital investors to support them in bringing this new idea to life.

Some of the investors included Quona Capital, Accion, Middle East Venture Partners, P1 Ventures and TMT Investments. Leveraging on their backgrounds in technology and finance, they set out to work.

Cross-border payment services

“There was significant opportunity within core target markets in Africa which on average record transactions of about $4.1billion (Sh541.2 billion) annually,” noted Mr Oduu, co-founder of Verto.

The Business-to-Business payment service would target registered businesses that needed to collect, convert or send payments with either global offices, customers or those that handled multiple currencies in their operations.

It would incorporate multi-currency wallets to enable businesses to freely convert and send payments in up to 50 currencies including the Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan among others.

To achieve this, the company established partnerships with financial institutions in major trade markets across the globe, as well as those in Africa.

“We designed products that would specifically facilitate large value cross-border payments and foreign exchange for companies doing business in Africa,” stated Mr Oduu.

It is estimated that the African diaspora sends over $50 billion (Sh6.6 trillion) back home every year and loses up to $3 billion (Sh396 billion) in high foreign exchange rates and hidden fees when sending money back home.

With this in mind, the entrepreneurs’ market entry strategy was to deliver a solution to cross-border payment services at a much more subsidised rate.

“Between quarter one and quarter three of 2023, Kenyan banks made $151 million (Sh19.9 billion) out of foreign exchange transactions. We built our own unified payment network to cut out intermediary complexity and fees, settling up to five times faster than traditional methods,” noted Oduu.

They realised that challenging institutions that had been operating in the market for years was not going to be easy, and they had to do more than simply launch a good product to succeed.

Notable growth metrics

“Cross-border payment platforms are still new in the regions we target. It is challenging getting into a market where most businesses do 90 per cent of the payment processing with banks,” noted Mr Ola.

Getting regulatory approvals in some of the jurisdictions that they were looking to venture into was also a challenge, as was the volatility of currencies in these emerging markets.

“The fluctuation of currencies slows the business in various aspects in the market, and this being a recurring issue in Africa, we have had to constantly review our model to come up with a solution,” noted Ola.

It has now been seven years since the firm began its operations in Africa and Kevin Ng’ang’a, the country director of Verto Kenya, says that over time, they have managed to gain a better grasp on the market.

Some of the notable growth metrics include facilitation of large value cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions for more than 2000 companies doing business in Africa.

“We have facilitated payouts to more than 170 countries, settling international payments in 27 different currencies and domestic accounts in 5 currencies including the US dollar, Euro, Sterling Pound, Nigerian Naira and Kenyan Shilling,” said Ng’ang’a.

“Our revenues have grown up to four times, thanks to the clients acquired in these new markets,” posed Mr Ng’ang’a.

The firm, which currently employs more than 100 employees in the various markets it operates in, is looking to venture into more jurisdictions within Africa, so as to facilitate Intra-Africa cross border payments for businesses trading under the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) market.

“This move will not only spur cross-border trade, but potentially enable us to grow our revenues 13 times over, in Africa alone, by 2030,” noted Ng’ang’a.

Joe Biden jabs Donald Trump in election-year roast at correspondents' dinner,"Washington

US President Joe Biden delivered an election-year roast on Saturday night at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner as protesters outside criticized his support for Israel's war against Hamas.

Biden used the annual black-tie event to chide his Republican rival Donald Trump for immaturity, poke fun at his own advanced age and take on the Washington press corps.

""Yes, age is an issue. I'm a grown man, running against a 6-year-old,"" Biden joked.

Biden, 81, later added of former President Trump, 77: ""Age is the only thing we have in common. My vice president actually endorses me.""

Trump reacted to the event by calling it ""really bad"" in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn’t get much worse than this!"" he said.

Demonstrators holding banners outside the gathering at the Washington Hilton chanted about journalists' deaths in Gaza. Hundreds of protesters encouraged journalists to boycott the annual event and shouted down administration officials as they entered.

Biden avoided the large protests at the front of the hotel by arriving through a back entrance, where he was greeted by smaller groups of protesters calling for a ceasefire.

At the century-old event, often referred to as Washington's ""nerd prom,"" hundreds of journalists, politicians and celebrities rubbed elbows in a massive banquet hall. It often features friendly jabs from the president in a closing speech that takes aim at reporters and other guests in the audience.

Biden offered some advice to the press corps.

""I'm sincerely not asking you to take sides. I'm asking you to rise up to the seriousness of the moment. Move past the horse race numbers and the gotcha moments and the distractions, the sideshows that have come to dominate and sensationalize our politics, and focus on what's actually at stake,"" Biden said.

This year, the event was hosted by ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Colin Jost.

Grassroots movement CODEPINK marched to the venue from a nearby park. ""The United States media perpetuates anti-Palestinian narratives and ignores Israeli war crimes,"" the group said on its website.

A growing movement against the war in Gaza has dogged Biden this year including at a $250-per-ticket March fundraiser at New York's Radio City Music Hall that was disrupted by protesters.

Recently, that movement has expanded to college campuses in the U.S., signifying a growing revolt inside the Democratic base that Biden needs to defeat Trump, who is now the Republican frontrunner.

Kelly O'Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, declined to comment on security measures for the dinner.

""The safety and security of our protectees is the US Secret Service's top priority,"" said US Secret Service spokesperson Alexi Worley, who declined to comment further.

Israel's six-month old war against Hamas in Gaza, in response to the October 7 attack by the militant group in southern Israel, has killed more than 34,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say, and caused a humanitarian disaster for the enclave's more than 2 million inhabitants.

The Hamas attack killed 1,200 people in Israel, and led to 253 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

The White House Correspondents Association was founded in 1914 and has held a dinner nearly every year since 1921 to celebrate the reporters who cover the presidency and raise money for scholarships.

Take measures to curb food insecurity,"Food insecurity has affected the country in a big way, including the economy. Yet most Kenyans do not engage in agricultural practices.

Many prefer an urban lifestyle and abandon their farms, leaving them unplanted, yet they experience food shortages and strain a lot to buy foodstuffs daily.

Most people’s salaries do not adequately cater for all their needs as they pay rent, and school fees and cater for the basic needs of their families. For instance, some people from central Kenya have abandoned their farms causing great havoc to the country.

Since the climatic conditions favour the growing of various crops and the rearing of livestock, this is a huge loss to the country. Here, they grow coffee, tea, maize, vegetables and many other crops and practise dairy farming. On the other hand, western Kenya boasts a huge share of maize production.

If all the people in these regions put an effort into utilising their farms, they could contribute at least 70 per cent to fighting hunger and food shortage.

The government should support them with effective fertilisers, better irrigation schemes, seeds, post-harvest storage, marketing, access to credit and much more. With such support, even those who prefer urban over rural life and do not have a stable job should also stick in their home areas and embrace farming.

Counties to open new frontiers for renewable energy,"The future of Kenya’s energy development will depend on clean energy solutions that can improve the quality of life at community levels.

Therefore, involving county governments is key as the devolved units are responsible for certain functions in areas such as agriculture, health and early childhood education.

The 47 counties are in the best position to account for the appropriate levels for energy access to be extended into development planning.

The linking of energy access to service provision and the County Energy Plans (CEP) will result in a successful integration of the National Energy Plan (INEP) as adopted in the Energy Act (2019).

A peek into the direction the CEPs are taking is clear- Kenya’s future, if all goes as planned – is clean energy.

This realisation comes at a time when the Sustainable Energy Technical Assistance (SETA) is facilitating 16 counties to come up with their CEPs.

“Everything is anchored on renewables. That is the future,” explains Mr Jechonia Kitala, the SETA key expert.

“Our project is involving 16 counties and all of them are going green,” he explained.

Counties have a raft of proposals such as solar, mini-hydros, e-cooking, green biofuels, wind and geothermal. Further, sources like biogas are emerging as a solution in saving forests from destruction.

Meru is one of the counties leading in biogas installations. The biogas is used for cooking, lighting, heating and running machines, for example, chaff cutter.

“The opportunities are immense and we are happy that more and more households are embracing non-traditional sources of energy like biogas,” said Jean Paul Claude, head of SETA.

Kenya's energy space has been vibrant, targeting just energy transition and universal access to electricity by 2030. It is also envisaged that the country will attain the ambitious target of universal access to clean cooking by 2028 and achieve net zero target by 2050.

According to Isaac Kiva, the secretary, Renewable Energy Directorate at the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, the completion of the CEPs is critical as they form the core components of the Integrated National Energy Plan (INEP) as espoused in the Energy Act (2019).

The total funding for SETA was Sh565 million. The funding was mainly technical support. However, about 25 counties are yet to start their CEPs.

Mr Kiva challenged counties to commit resources to finalise their CEPs so that Kenya can have consolidated INEP for rollout. Council of Governors representative Rosemary Rop observed that there are many opportunities in non-tradition energies, renewable energy solutions and liquid biofuels. She said energy is a key enabler that supports diverse sectors such as agriculture, water, health, and nutrition among others.

Mr Kiva noted that the energy portfolio is expanding and now the national government is keen on e-mobility and e-cooking that will not only expand the energy eco-system but also offer opportunities for employment, investment and improved lifestyles.

Mr Dan Marangu, the director of Renewable Energy, Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, said the project is key as it sets the path for a strategic journey towards achieving Sustainable Energy for All by 2030.

“Ultimately, we are looking at universal access to clean, reliable and affordable energy,” he noted.

Ms Elizabeth Muchiri, the director of Global LPG Partnership, said only six per cent of rural Kenya uses liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) while the national average is 26 per cent.

“Though Kenya is among the countries with high LPG uses, a lot more needs to be done to stimulate uptake. We need regulations that support safety, affordability and accessibility. That is one of the efforts the County Energy Plans is strongly proposing going forward,” she explained.

Mr Martin Andersen, head of Infrastructure and Energy, European Delegation in Kenya, lauded the country for the robust green grid that is about 90 per cent renewable. “We are proud of Kenya, and we will support the country towards 100 per cent green grid,” said Mr Andersen.

He said there are other interesting emerging areas that the EU is keen on supporting Kenya like green hydrogen, which is set to create more jobs.

Mr Andersen reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to support Kenya’s “Green Resilient Electricity System” that will strengthen transmission and stimulate the development of green energy.

Mr Kiva noted that the time is ripe to review the energy policy and streamline it like a sessional paper to give it strong anchorage in law.

The last of Obuya's cricket trilogy calls time on his decorated career,"Whenever Kenya's Collins Obuya plays cricket, his performances remind fans why he is one of the country's finest exponents of the game.

And it is easy to see why.

An all-rounder, the 42-year-old bats right-handed and bowls leg spin. He shot to fame at the 2003 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Collins was one of Kenya's best performers in the tournament, helping the country reach the historic semi-finals for the first time.

His retirement from the national team last month closed a rosy chapter in Kenyan cricket as he was the last member of the legendary team, still playing competitive cricket.

Now, as then, he displays flashes of brilliance that made him one of the most revered all-rounders in the world.

After 23 years in the game, the 42-year-old called time on a decorated career that has seen him play 568 times for Kenya.

He has played club cricket in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and Uganda.

Yet when his elder brothers Kennedy and David introduced him to the sport in the ‘90s, he did not envisage himself playing for that long.

“I consider it a miracle that I have played for this long,” the all-rounder tells Nation Sport.

“I’m very grateful for that, and I thank God for keeping me fit all this long.”

The father of two now joins a long list of players who frequented the ICC Cricket World Cup when Kenya was a force to reckon with in the game but watched helplessly in recent years as the standards of the game deteriorated.

In an enthralling bronze medal match between Kenya and Uganda at the 13th African Games in Accra on March 23, Collins had a deep conviction that it was time he bowed out of international duty while still at the top.

Yet, it wasn't meant to end this way.

“Heading to Ghana, I had no plans to retire from the game but at some point (in the match between Kenya and Uganda), I felt that my body was struggling,” says the right-hand batsman and leg-spinner, who was still Kenya’s best player by a mile.

“I felt that it was time for me to retire.”

He smashed three half-centuries in the African Games – 58 runs off 47 balls against South Africa - and 68 runs off 30 balls against Ghana in the group stage.In the semi-finals against Zimbabwe, he posted 52 runs off 29 balls. Taking to the crease for his last innings as a batsman for Kenya, the veteran cricketer had hoped to give his fans a treat of his blazing boundaries and towering sixes one more time.

It didn’t happen.

Weighed down by age and tiring feet, the 42-year-old bowled out before getting any run. In cricket terms, Collins was dismissed for a duck, and Uganda beat Kenya by 106 runs.

But with several achievements to his name, that was not how he had planned to retire from the sport he loved.

Yet even a disastrous last innings of his international career wasn’t stopping him from popping the champagne on his national team retirement.

The guard of honour mounted by Kenya and Uganda players at the end of the match and a long applause from the spectators signalled that his remarkable career with the national team is one for the history books.

“I’m very proud of my performance,” the former Kenya captain said.

“I played for Kenya in the Under-19 ICC World Cup (1998 and 2000), the T20 World Cup (2007) and two editions of the One-Day International World Cup (2003 and 2011). I’m very grateful for that and I wish to thank everyone who supported me. I thank God for enabling me to play that long.”

The dangerous opening batsman still wants to play for his family’s team, Obuya Cricket Academy, for two more years, after which he will transition to coaching. The secret to his longevity in the game?

“The love and passion I have for cricket is what has kept me going for this long,” he says. “But those who know me well will tell you that I’m one person who trains very hard. Every morning, I hit the gym for about an hour, after which I bat, bowl, and field with the help of my coach. After all that, I joined my teammates in training. At home, I ensure that I eat well and have enough rest and sleep,” adds the player-cum-coach, stressing that he is a teetotaller.

A strong sense of personal discipline, the all-rounder says, has had a huge impact on his longevity in cricket.

“I have played under many coaches, who were also my teammates in the national team. I don’t think that would have been possible if I were not disciplined. Despite being people whom I played cricket with, I never disrespected them when they became my coaches,” says the towering cricketer.

The players he played with and ended up being his coaches in the national team are Thomas Odoyo, Steve Tikolo, his elder brother David, Martin Suji, current coach Lameck Onyango, and assistant coaches Peter Ong’ondo and Joseph Angara.

What was it like for him to play in a team coached by his brother David?

“The working relationship was good. I respected him as my coach, and he respected me in return as his player. Anytime I cost the team, he openly called me out,” says Collins.

Had Kennedy and David not introduced him to cricket, he would have tried his luck in football.

“I loved playing football in the estate. I had no specific position, but I had great potential,” offers the leg-spinner.

Kennedy and David learnt cricket at the Aga Khan Sports Club in Nairobi, located just a few yards from where their family lived.

Since Aga Khan Sports Club paid school fees for its players from humble backgrounds, Collins says their parents always encouraged them to take the sport seriously. Playing as a bowler, he became an integral part of the club’s cricket team. It was not long before his continued top performance for the club started taking him places.

He was part of the squad that represented Kenya in the 1998 and 2000 editions of the ICC Under-19 Men’s World Cup (ODI) held in South Africa and Sri Lanka (50 overs), respectively.

After making his senior debut for Kenya in 2001 against West Indies in an ODI match at the Sikh Union Club in Nairobi, the right-hand batsman represented the country in most subsequent tournaments.

Had he been faint-hearted, he would have called time on his cricket career ages ago.

While Collins’ top performance in the 2003 World Cup earned him a one-year contract with English countryside Warwickshire, he failed to make any impression at the club.

At Warwickshire, things became tougher for Collins when he was sidelined for five months with a knee injury. When he resumed playing, he continued to struggle with his bowling. Not even specialised training in Australia in 2005 under the legendary cricketer Terry Jenner helped things.

But since old habits die hard, Collins never gave up on reviving his cricket career. He elected to turn all his attention to perfecting his batting, and his star began to shine again. When Collins called time on his international career in Accra, he was still Kenya’s top batsman.

“There is no trick to it (his top batting). I just spend time on training, read the opposition’s game, and adjust accordingly,” he says of his impressive batting throughout the years.

He says being part of the revered Kenyan team in the 2003 World Cup and the experience he has gained from playing with different players in different generations have also been crucial to his top performance at an advanced age.

“Maurice Odumbe would share with me tips on how to be a top bowler,” he says of Kenya’s most talented cricketer who became his role model.

“Kennedy shared with me the tricks to apply to stay long on the crease and score big runs,” the former national team captain says.

“He (Odumbe) could bat, bowl, and spin so well. That motivated me to work hard and be like him. He helped me a lot with my spin bowling,” he recalls.

Collins pays tribute to his family, especially his wife Rachel, for supporting his career. “They have been supporting me in good and bad times. When I got the injury, they were there for me, they supported me to get back,” says the former Stray Lions Cricket Club, Sikh Union Club, and Ruaraka Cricket Club player.

“I want to thank her (Rachel) for being there for me and the family whenever I was not around. She was taking care of the kids, I thank and appreciate her in a big way,” added Collins, who also played for Weymouth Cricket Club (UK), Pirates Cricket Club (South Africa), Caboolture Cricket Club (Australia), Ceylon Lions Cricket Club and Tornado Bees Cricket Club in Uganda.

Until July last year, Collins still harboured the dream of playing in the prestigious India Premier League. But following his retirement from international duty, he has given up on that dream and hopes to achieve it through his 16-year-old son Troy.

“I will try and convince him to work hard and achieve that dream. He is coming up nicely,” says Collins. He has also introduced his young daughter Alma to cricket and wants to see her don the national team colours in future.

He plans to pursue ICC Coaching Course Level III Cricket Certification.

“I’m waiting for the opportunity to come up for me to improve my coaching career. I hope to coach different teams at different levels,” Collins, who has already undertaken Level I and II of the ICC coaching certifications, says.

“I not only want to coach them (Kenya) but I also want to take the team to the World Cup.”

With more time on his hands, he has also started playing golf for fun. Outside cricket, Collins loves reading books, swimming, and making friends.

Emphasise health education and disease prevention,"Since Independence, when the government promised to fight ignorance, disease and poverty, health has been on the radar of successive governments.

We have made huge strides in curative health services but that is not enough. A healthy nation is one that includes all aspects of what health actually is.

Health education is essential if people are to learn to live healthily and avoid diseases. Health education helps people to care about their own health and take part in organising health services and disease control programmes. It is the route to making people realise that health and healthcare services are basic human rights for mankind.

Community health workers should link health services to development. In primary prevention, which is the beginning of healthy living, education enables people to value good health and know about diseases and how to make use of organised health services.

The Maternal and Child Health Clinics (MCH) success has been through vigorous education and awareness creation. The road to health begins at the grass root.

Proper information motivates people to practise personal hygiene and healthy habits like using safe water, proper sanitation and proper waste management. Through health education, medical workers can easily understand what people want.

There will be proper communication to develop healthier lives. That will help the country to gain ground in health service delivery, especially in rural areas, enabling people to understand preventive health services.

They will value the different screening procedures. When citizens are well informed, they are able to recognise the symptoms and signs of important diseases that affect them daily.

Health education, when properly carried out, becomes a two-way process. It is not just medical staff telling people what to do. The people will help the medics to understand their situation, needs and demands. Culture and the environment are vital in boosting health services. Good communication will create rapport with the audience.

Sea wanderlust: Four-day vacation on a cruise ship,"At 6:22 am on a Monday, I stand outside my cabin in awe of the sunrise, watching it from the sea. The sun, fiery reddish and orange, sits on the water on the horizon.

The clouds, it is like watching a fiery red cotton candy move in the sky. The sea is changing too. Becoming calmer. The sea is turning blue, from the dark grey at night. Scary, if sailing through a storm.

I am inside a cruise ship, MSC Splendida, docking at Cape Town Cruise Terminal in South Africa.

It is day 5 of a South Africa vacation, perhaps the ultimate on my bucket list experience.

Since South Africa removed visa restrictions for Kenyan travellers, many holidaymakers are trooping there. Last year, Kenyan travellers to South Africa rose by 99 percent, compared to 2022, reaching 42,403 arrivals from January to December 2023, the Minister of Tourism, Patricia de Lille says.

Just like the thousands of Kenyans seeking off-the-beaten-path destinations, I sampled South Africa’s top attractions; I spent three nights on a cruise ship from Durban to Cape Town, dined in nine restaurants, rode a quad-bike on the Atlantis dunes stretching about 10 kilometres and watched Cape Town from atop Table Mountain, which makes you feel like you are the Biblical Moses on Mount Sinai.

Day 1:

I arrive at OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg at about 11 am ahead of a connecting flight to King Shaka Zulu International in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal where I will start my cruise ship journey. It is a smaller plane to Durban.

I am anxious about sleeping on water, on a cruise ship, but I reason that there are many other ways I could perish, and rough, choppy air or water may not be it. That is before turbulence starts shaking the plane. Nothing reminds us of our mortality quite like suddenly dropping a few metres mid-air, locked in the belly of an aeroplane.

I did not know I could grip an armrest so tight. But we land safely and head to Sun International’s Sibaya Lodge in KwaZulu Natal. Calmness sets in as soon as we arrived. The hotel resembles large thatched domes, built in an unspoilt location with lots of greenery, overlooking the ocean. It has a big casino, which has older women holidaymakers, at the slot machines. This looks like a good retirement pastime; travelling to different countries to sample their casinos.

Lunch is at a Portuguese restaurant within Sibaya Lodge, which has four restaurants to choose from.

Day 2

The drive from Sibaya Lodge to the Nelson Mandela Cruise Terminal takes about one hour. At 11:34 am, we arrive at the terminal.

MSC Splendida is standing at the dock. She is humongous. Beautiful. She is white. At full capacity, we are told, she holds about 4,000 passengers and 1,300 crew members.

The check-in is like at the airport, including a luggage limit of two suitcases not exceeding 23 kilos each. And if you are the kind that packs an iron box while travelling, the port security will confiscate it. There is a photo booth where an embarkation souvenir photo is taken, just before you board.

My room is on deck 10, Cabin 10021. It has a balcony and an ocean view. It is small and cosy. Has a big bed. Okay, a sizable bed. It does not feel crampy. The decor is minimalist.

After settling in, we grab a late lunch at 3pm at Pago Pago restaurant. It is laid back and so are the meals; pizzas, burgers, fried pork and French fries. At Pago Pago, there is no dress code. You are allowed to walk in casually dressed; in sandals, or shorts.

There are seven restaurants on this ship, including The Butcher’s Cut which serves high-end Angus beef and Bora Bora with a buffet stretching a few kilometres; meaning you will sit at a table and remember you may just need a croissant. You walk back through the tens of food stations and get lost.

After lunch, we start combing through every deck of the ship. Some decks are restricted unless you are a crew member or very moneyed and a member of the yacht club. The 333 metres-long ship has 17 decks. It is packed with amenities to craft a family vacation; from swimming pools, a theatre hall and a Formula 1 racing simulator, a Lego room, a casino, an amusement park, shops selling clothes and luxury jewellery, among others.

There are 19 bars and lounges in it, complete with Kenyan bartenders, who can shake up a very good Manhattan or a Skyfall [which has Hendrick’s gin, lime juice, blueberry liqueur and mint leaves]. To escape crowds, you sit on a cushy sofa listening to a pianist, oblivious to the choppy waters beneath the ship. There is also wine tasting with a sommelier on board.

At 5:34 pm, the ship intercom calls for a mandatory safety drill. The lifts are locked, and we must walk down the stairs. You must swipe your room card at a designated location to show that you attended the safety drill. A few minutes past 6pm, the ship starts sailing.

Dinner is at Villa Verde restaurant on Deck 6. Here, you dress up and sit at the table 30 minutes before serving. No wearing flip flops, tank tops, t-shirts or shorts. By 8 pm, we are at the door, some dressed up in high heels and dinner wear. We are ushered to our tables. Just like non-casual dining restaurants, the small-plated meals are timed and served with precision.

At 10:15 pm, there is a welcome party on Deck 14 and an after-party, with DJ Zee. Some of my colleagues go partying. I get seasickness and walk back to my room.

Sleeping in a room floating on water and staring into nothingness is ineffable. I open the door to the balcony and gaze patiently at the inert horizon. There is no moving object, no living thing that might rouse me from the nothingness, just grey water with huge rumbling tides. It is a bit scary. I start feeling queasy and sicker. I walk back to my small room, about 20 square metres big, take motion sickness pills and sleep. The night is calm.

Day 3

Walking through MSC Splendida, one of the largest ships to sail on African waters, is like roaming through a big shopping mall, with a seemingly endless number of amenities — water parks, multiple restaurants, theatre halls, one that sits 1,700 people, a nightclub, gym, spa, and library.

Because there are many activities on the ship [you get a daily programme of what to do], you may wake up surprised by the relative absence of crowds. After breakfast, worried that I may have overslept, and people disappeared from the ship [my mind overworks sometimes], I start walking deck to deck checking out if people are still on board and what they are doing least I miss out. I find small crowds of people doing body stretches and indoor cycling at the gym. Others are in a “sexy legs competition.” Hilarious. Some are playing mini golf. Others are watching live music while some are learning Latino dance.

Deck 15 seems to be a favourite for many guests. The many swimming pools are designed for different vibes and demographics. There is a DJ, a pool bar and lounge chairs, plentiful for sunbathers. Movida Bar, where you drink while staring at the sea, is also located on Deck 15. It is 11 am and Deck 15 is throbbing. This is where the party is. The music is loud, and so is the laughter. Alcohol is flowing. Families are in small pools, jacuzzi-like. Others are in the big pool.

I skip lunch because here good food is in plenty and almost round the clock, so you will overeat.

In the afternoon, the karaoke and sports bar is crowded and noisy as football lovers watch an Arsenal and Manchester United match.

Seeking a quiet space, I find the La Prua piano bar, a tranquil area with cushy sofas and a pianist. Guests are napping on the sofas as others chat in low tones, sipping wine. The library is also quiet. It is not your traditional library. There are no visible books. One passenger, deep in thought, is staring outside the round window. Hopefully, the rhythm of the water set his soul free.

Dinner is in another bourgeois restaurant, La Reggia. This too has a dress code. Not to worry, it is not a black-tie dress code. The food is very good. It is hard to imagine how they keep it so fresh.

Contrary to the belief that most passengers on cruise ships are old retirees, aboard this ship, there are young families and children, men and women in their 20s to 40s.

There was a solo guest, deaf and dumb. Disability has not stopped him from exploring.

The nightclub, Club33 Disco on the 16th deck, is proof that interest among younger generations and Africans who have never cruised is higher than ever.

At 10:30pm, the dance floor, with Amapiano songs playing, is full of young people. The DJ, another Kenyan working on the cruise ship plays Kenyan songs, but we soon realise Kenyan songs do not resonate with many on international dancefloors.

Day 4

What does a cruise ship engine room look like? I asked a friend who paid $60 (Sh7,800) for the tour.

“It is like standing in a science-fiction movie,” she says.

On this “behind the scenes” tour, you get to meet the captain, the five pilots and 10 engineers, and experience what goes on into steering a ship at sea.

Another exhilarating travel experience is finding a Kenyan on board and hearing their stories. At breakfast, we hear someone singing a Kikuyu song. We laugh out loud and call her. She studied pharmacy before ditching the profession because of low pay. She worked in Dubai at banquet hotels before moving to cruise ships. She has worked in Europe and now South Africa.

The crew live in another entire ecosystem within the ship, often below passenger decks. While they spend most of their time serving passengers, there are several areas on the lower decks designated for them to unwind. The facilities vary from ship to ship and include a restaurant, rooms, gym, and bar.

There is also a hospital. I got a flu and thought of seeing a doctor. Consultation is $180 (Sh23,400 at that time). I walked back, entered a lift, and pressed the button to Deck 6 where there is a bar with a casino. I pull a chair and wonder if they sell ""dawa"". George, the bartender laughs as I try to explain 'dawa' in English. Kenyans smell each other especially when in foreign waters. He hands me a cocktail to kick the flu. I don't ask for the ingredients. There is some camaraderie and trust that brews when Kenyans are away from home.

Getting back to your room on such a cruise ship needs mastery in map reading. For the umpteenth time, I get lost. Cabin 10021 seems so far, yet so near. The corridors are zigzaggy. The sea is choppy. The ship is rocking. I stagger. Not from the cocktail but the mild sways of the ship.

But it is not too wobbly unless you have drunk too much. It might be harder to steady yourself.

One of the biggest surprises on the cruise ship is the array of dining options. At midnight, I feel hungry. I walk back to Bora Bora restaurant for the freshly made pizza, and cookies. I am not the only one coming in for the midnight snack. Other guests are just from Club 33 Disco on the top deck.

Day 5

At 6:21 am, the sunrays burrow into the ocean horizon. The sunrise is breathtaking. The sea is so blue it is purple. Welcome to Cape Town Cruise Terminal is seen from afar. The crew stands waiting. Two ambulances and berthing service cars are there too. Other ships, but cargo, have docked at Cape Town port. MSC Splendida sails slowly.

Skyscrapers, most painted in platone colours; whites and light greys, are seen in front of Table Mountain. Cape Town has awakened. Cars are on the road just near the ocean.

At 9am, we disembark.

I feel an immaculate sense of balance. “Life is good,” the voice in my head says, this time without any cynicism.

Many Africans are yet to look to cruising as a high-value alternative to land travel. To woo African travellers, the MSC cruise line started 34, two to five-night sailings from Durban and Cape Town to Portuguese Island and Pomene Island in Mozambique, Walvis Bay in Namibia and Port Louis in Mauritius.

The cost? For instance, a six-day Christmas cruise on December 23 from Durban in South Africa to Pomene in Mozambique, back through Portuguese Island in the same country, aboard MSC Musica, for two people, costs about 50,000 rands (Sh347,609).

As South Africa seeks to grow its tourism number, it also courting thrill seekers.

We head out to Atlantis Dunes Quad biking, 45 kilometres from Cape Town city. Here, the view is unforgettable, and so is the experience of riding a quad bike on dunes.

Dinner is back in Cape Town, at the Bungalow Restaurant, which is a must-visit. I eat kingklip fillet paired with one of the best Sauvignon Blancs I have tasted.

Day 6

Going up Table Mountain in a cable car is a must-do in Cape Town. I walk on the stone mountain wondering if I will hear Biblical Moses’ voice echo from yonder. The unobstructed views of the sea and city below — justify the visit. We then head to StellenBosch for winetasting and lunch. Stellenbosch smells of acclaimed vintners and we found two; one at Morgenhof Estate and and another at Seven Sisters Vineyards, both women.

Day 7

Back to Kenya, with bottles of wines from boutique vineyards, of course, lots of memories and post-vacation depression.

Plastic-free environment can beat climate change,"Kenya once emerged as a leader in the fight against plastic pollution after being among the first countries in East Africa to limit the use of single-use plastics. It also signed the Clean Seas initiative to rid waterways of plastic waste.

The main aim of banning plastic bottles was to save human and aquatic life. Researchers had warned that as plastic pollution increases in the country, Kenyans would suffer the related health complications. Despite pioneering the ban, however, we are still drowning in single-use plastic.

Kenya outlawed single-use of plastic bags in 2017 but there are still no laws requiring corporations that profit from single-use plastic bottles to clean up what they produce. Even today, plastic bags are circulated all over the country as if there is no information of its ban.

Kenyans should understand that the discarded PET bottles line roadsides and drainage ditches like confetti and swathes of rivers flow beneath floating canopies of the stuff. The deadly waste eventually ends up in lakes and oceans, causing dangerous pollution.

During the rainy season, this becomes dire as the plastic waste clogs drainage systems, contributing to massive flooding. To fight against the effects of climatic change, our environmental bodies should strengthen laws spelling out responsible plastic use and how to recycle used plastics for an effective and efficient health environment.

Citizens ought to embrace effective recycling of used plastics to ensure a clean environment. All should support the world leaders, who have pledged to stop the adverse effects of climatic change by 2030. Let us protect our planet, Earth.

Auditor General Gathungu raises alarm over expenditure in county stadiums,"Auditor General Nancy Gathungu has flagged the expenditure of millions of public funds in various sports projects by county governments.

In her report on County Government Executives for the financial year ending June 30, 2023, Ms Gathungu said it was impossible to prove value for money spent on most of the sports projects being undertaken by the devolved units.

She added that there was a violation of the law during the implementation of some of the projects, the contract prices for the construction of some of the facilities were unlawfully increased, and there was irregular payment of allowances to some of the players and officials.

Bukhungu Stadium (Kakamega), Masinde Muliro Stadium (Bungoma), Siaya Stadium, Raila Odinga Stadium (Homa Bay) and Mombasa County Stadium are among the facilities that have been flagged for the irregularities.

In the case of Bukhungu Stadium, Ms Gathungu noted that the value for money of more than Sh1 billion, which includes Sh175,950,266 paid to the contractor for the construction of the second phase of the arena cannot be proven.

The contract for the project was awarded on May 21, 2019, at a sum price of Sh2,927,721,199, with the completion date set for December 30, 2021.

But a physical inspection of the facility in October 2023 established that the project was only 45 percent complete, with the contractor not on site.

“In the circumstances, value for money on the expenditure of Sh1,059,870,800 incurred on the construction of Bukhungu Stadium could be confirmed,” said Ms Gathungu.

Bukhungu Stadium is among the venues earmarked for the 2024 Africa Nations Championship (Chan) in September.

The Ministry of Sports has since partnered with the Kakamega County government to have the facility ready for the competition.

While Siaya Stadium was to be constructed at the tune of Sh394,661,767, the latest audit on the facility revealed that the contract price had irregularly been increased by Sh129,567,506, with a second contractor unlawfully being brought on board.

The new contract price for the construction of the facility was thus Sh524,229,273. But the value for money of Sh425,038,687 already wired to the two contractors building the stadium could not be confirmed and the works were behind schedule.

“There was no evidence of recommendations by an evaluation committee for these variations contrary to Section 139(1) and (2) of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015,” stated the Auditor General.

The contract for the construction of Siaya Stadium was signed on August 30, 2018, with the works expected to be completed in December 2019.

The extended contract period lapsed in July 2023.

The pitch, main pavilion, terraces, amphitheater, installations of the electrical fittings, plumbing fittings, and the roof are the works, which were still pending as of September 2023.

The audit revealed that the contractor building the Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi had been overpaid.

The construction of the stadium was expected to take two years from June 14, 2019.But despite only 70 percent of work having been done as of September 2023, Bungoma County government had paid the contractor Sh582,849,313 or 86 percent of the contract price.

The total cost of the contract was Sh679,386,376.

“No explanation was provided on the overpayment against actual works done,” stated Ms Gathungu.

“It was also observed that the actual payments of Sh582, 849, 313 included Sh40,200,000 paid to preliminary expenses, which were not supported. The expenditure of Sh582,849,313 also included Sh10,000,000 paid as contingencies but was not supported by appraisal of work done.”

The auditor general further revealed that roofing works for the facility were subcontracted to another contractor to the tune of Sh96,822,150.

However, the subcontracting agreement between the main contractor and the sub-contractor was not provided for audit.

In the case of Raila Odinga Stadium, the auditor general noted: “The regularity and value for money on the expenditure Sh49,678,406 incurred on the project could not be confirmed.”

Ms Gathungu said that the accounting officer for the Mombasa County Stadium project irregularly suspended its contract, with completed works to the tune of Sh619,782,152 or approximately 35 percent.

The contract for the proposed development of Mombasa County Stadium to the tune of Sh1,768,183,999 was signed on December 21, 2018, with the completion date set for January 6, 2022.

The completion date was extended by 65 weeks to May 6, 2022.

The auditor general said that the suspension of the contract on April 15, 2022, was not proposed by the contract implementation team as required by law – “since it had not been appointed and was done before the end of extended completion date.”

She warned that the “project is exposed to risks of cost escalation and project termination.”

Ms Gathungu also said it was not possible to confirm the distribution of sports equipment and items worth Sh97, 120,233 by the Department of Gender, Youth, Sports, Culture and Tourism in Trans Nzoia county government.

This was because the “department did not have in place approved guidelines and procedures on the identification of beneficiaries, establishment of a distribution approach and system, determination and formation of distribution teams, pre-distribution reporting and post-distribution monitoring.”

In the other expenditure that has raised eyebrows the auditor general said payment of Sh12,730,000 to players, team managers, and coaches who represented Kiambu County in the ninth edition of the Kicosca games in Kisumu County in January 2023 could not be confirmed since the payments were not supported by any document including certificate of participation in the Kicosca or evidence of registration of teams and players.

"Iran launches retaliatory attack on Israel with hundreds of drones, missiles","Jerusalem,

Iran launched a swarm of explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel late on Saturday in its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, risking a major escalation as the United States pledged ""ironclad"" backing for Israel.

Sirens wailed and Reuters journalists in Israel said they heard distant heavy thuds and bangs from what local media called aerial interceptions of explosive drones. Authorities said a 7-year-old girl was critically injured.

Israel's military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Iran launched dozens of ground-to-ground missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted outside Israeli borders. They included more than 10 cruise missiles, he said.

The Iranian salvo amounted to more than 200 drones and missiles so far, Hagari said, and had caused light damage to one Israeli military facility.

The Israeli military said later that it was not advising any residents to prepare to take shelter, revising an earlier alert in what appeared to signal the end of the threat.

Israel's Channel 12 TV cited an unnamed Israeli official as saying there would be a ""significant response"" to the attack.

Iran had vowed retaliation for what it called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on April 1 that killed seven Guards officers including two senior commanders and said its strike was a punishment for ""Israeli crimes"". Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the consulate attack.

""Should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe,"" the Iranian mission to the United Nations said, warning the U.S. to ""stay away"". However, it also said Iran now ""deemed the matter concluded"".

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Iran's attack, saying he was ""deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation.""

The UN Security Council aims to meet at 4 pm ET (2000 GMT) on Sunday, a diplomat said on condition of anonymity, after Israel requested it condemn Iran's attack and designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organisation.

Read: Three sons of Hamas leader Haniyeh killed in Israeli airstrike

US President Joe Biden, who on Friday had warned Iran against an attack, cut short a weekend visit to his home state of Delaware. Hereturned to Washington and met national security advisers, including his secretaries of defence and state, in the White House Situation Room. He pledged to stand with Israel.

""Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,"" he said on X after the meeting.

The Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, now in its seventh month, has ratcheted up tensions in the region, spreading to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawing long-range fire at Israeli targets from as far away as Yemen and Iraq.

British maritime security company Ambrey said in a statement that drones were also reportedly launched against Israel by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group.

Those clashes now threaten to morph into a direct open conflict pitting Iran and its regional allies against Israel and its main supporter, the United States. Regional power Egypt urged ""utmost restraint"".

While Israel and Iran have been bitter foes for decades, their long feud has mostly unfolded via proxy forces or by targeting each other's forces operating in third countries.

U.S. and British warplanes were involved in shooting down some Israel-bound drones over the Iraq-Syria border area, Channel 12 reported. Two U.S. officials said the U.S. military had shot down dozens of drone aircraft headed for Israel.



ESCALATION

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose official jet took off shortly after the attack began, convened the war cabinet at a military headquarters in Tel Aviv, his office said.

Israel and Lebanon said they were closing their airspace on Saturday night. Jordan, which lies between Iran and Israel, had readied air defences to intercept any drone or missile that violated its territory, two regional security sources said.

Residents in several Jordanian cities said they heard heavy aerial activity.

Syria, an ally of Iran, said it was putting its ground-to-air defence systems around the capital and major bases on high alert, army sources there said.

The European Union, Britain, France, Mexico, Czechia, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands all condemned Iran's attack.

Israel had been bracing for an Iranian response to the Damascus consulate strike since last week, when Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel ""must be punished and shall be"" for an operation he called equivalent to one on Iranian soil.

Iran's main ally in the region, the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah that has been exchanging fire with Israel since the Gaza war began on October 7, said early on Sunday it had fired rockets at an Israeli base.

A fifth of chief executives cut jobs as sales decline,"About a fifth (22.4 per cent) of chief executives of private sector firms reduced jobs in the three months ended March as weak demand for goods and services persisted.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) survey that targeted CEOs of over 1,000 private sector through direct online questionnaires showed the job cuts came on the back of a third (33.6 per cent) of the surveyed businesses posting a fall in sales in the review period compared to the previous three-month period ended December 2023.

Executives drawn from diverse sectors including manufacturing and agriculture are also painting grim pictures for job seekers in the current second quarter of the year. About 19.6 per cent of them told the CBK they expect to cut their headcount in the three months ending June.

Sales declined

The January to March period had seen the majority (60.7 per cent) of CEOs keep their numbers unchanged while just 16.8 per cent hired more workers. In the current quarter, 63.6 per cent expect to keep their staff count unchanged while just 16.8 per cent see chances of hiring.

The CBK survey shows while a third of the CEOs had seen sales decline in the first quarter, 32.7 per cent of the businesses did not see any change in sales even as another 33.6 per cent posted increased sales compared with the three months ended December 2023.

Firms in the manufacturing sector were the most hit, with 45.5 per cent of CEOs surveyed saying they had seen a drop in demand for their goods while a further 18.2 per cent saw no change. A third (33.3 per cent) of CEOs leading firms in the agricultural sector posted a decline as 27.8 per cent of those in the services sector saw reduced demand.

Increased cost of production

“Business activity in the manufacturing sector remained subdued, largely due to the low consumer purchasing power and the increased cost of production, particularly cost of energy and credit,” said the CBK in the survey. The survey usually targets CEOs of key private sector organisations including members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance.

In terms of employment, 40 per cent of respondents employed less than 100 employees, while 29 per cent of respondents hired over 500 people.

The CBK findings, when compared to those released last December, show that the manufacturing sector remains the most affected when it comes to reduced demand for goods.

“Most respondents in the manufacturing sector expect business activity to either remain the same or increase, largely driven by seasonality factors. Firms expect to utilise their existing idle capacity to meet the demand,” the survey said.

Have floods humanitarian assistance plan,"As it continues to rain heavily, as forecast by the Kenya Meteorological Department, several people have died with many others displaced as a result of flooding in different parts of the country.

According to the Met, Nairobi, Kiambu, western Kenya, Nyanza and the coastal region are expected to experience heavy rains this month.

Last month, at least 10 people died in floods as a result of heavy rainfall in Nairobi while several families were displaced amid the destruction of homes and other property. Torrential rains in Mwea, Kirinyaga County, submerged homes, rendering 700 people from three villages homeless as the Thiba River broke its banks.

The floods also destroyed rice paddies in the local irrigation scheme and submerged business premises. As the heavy rains continue, those living near rivers and lakes should take precautions and be prepared for the possibility of flooding as the chances of breaking their banks are very high.

Meanwhile, the government should set up rescue centres and deploy emergency services for those people in flood-prone areas. That will ensure nobody is killed, injured or displaced in case of flooding and also offer guidance and counselling services to those traumatised by the catastrophe.

The government should also set aside emergency funds to cater for such cases and ease. Humanitarian assistance should be readily available.

"Ensure children play, it helps them to grow","Many parents force their children to stay indoors and study, play alone or get onto the internet on their digital devices. That usually happens during the school holidays, like now.

However, that denies children the opportunity to interact with their peers. Allowing children to play and enjoy their childhood is crucial for their physical and mental development. It also enhances physical health through movement activities since it boosts the growth of, especially, the muscles.

Play also provides children with an opportunity for emotional development. The can express their emotions by laughing and crying and learn more about association with their friends.

The memories of a great day linger on their minds for a long time, even in adulthood. They develop emotional intelligence and resilience.

Social interaction is also achieved. They make friends and get to learn one another’s behaviours. Some even become lifetime friends. Playing children also attain social skills when they negotiate, share and resolve conflicts among themselves.

Besides, play is a natural stress reliever. Allowing one to enjoy their childhood prevents the scenario where teenagers do things that appear childish, which they might have been denied.

With the current technology, children may do great things when they come together. A lot of the content we enjoy on social media is created by children, ranging from music to comedy.

Parents should allow their children to interact with others and explore their creativity as they could do something constructive. Lastly, research shows children who fail to play and exercise are slow learners and introverts while those who do are always jovial and extroverts.

Here’s how to deal with your ex-husband’s new girlfriend,"There’ll always be ‘other women’ in your life. And your children’s. Grandmothers, aunts, cousins, teachers. And they can all be troublesome on occasions!

But nobody compares to that special ‘other woman,’ your ex-husband’s new squeeze. Though to be fair, she thinks that you’re also a nightmare. Her new boyfriend’s ex!

You hate the way she plays happy families with your children, and that your ex helps with hers.

Meanwhile, she feels vulnerable because you and her boyfriend have a history together, and must have been happy together, once upon a time, so anytime she treats you badly, it’s probably more about her insecurities than anything else.

She may try to mother your children, which will cause a lot of problems, but it’s almost an instinct. She’ll also feel that your ex is paying you too much child support, however illogical that may seem.

Hopefully all the drama will subside, but it may take quite a while, meanwhile, everything about her makes you angry, and you resent her becoming a part of your children’s lives.

It’s important to overcome feelings like these. Try to recognise that you and your ex’s new girlfriend are really two sides of the same coin. Two women caught in a web of vulnerabilities, anxieties and jealousies.

So, don’t make negative comments or ask intrusive questions when your ex mentions her, rather, try to deal with your feelings on your own. Don’t hate her just because of who she is, try instead to focus on the needs of your children.

For instance, you can’t insist that the new girlfriend can never meet them. Of course you want to, but just don’t.

Smile and be polite when you meet her, however miserable you feel inside. Try to be friendly and to get to know her. You probably have a lot in common, after all you both chose to have a relationship with the same man. She can even become your ally in bringing up your children, and in managing your ex’s behaviour towards you.

Don’t ask your children about her. That will just motivate them to start lying to you about their time together. And whatever you do, don’t involve them in disputes, or make them feel guilty for having fun with her because it really is ok for your children to enjoy her company. No one can ever replace you as their mother. She may act like she is, but your children do understand the difference.

They’ll also soon grow up, therefore work towards the adult relationship you’ll have with them in the future, which will last far longer than their childhood.

And when you’re ready to start dating, just go for it! It’s good for your children to see you in a relationship, but choose someone who understands all the issues, probably because they’re in the same situation.

It will be hard work, but with your support, your children will do just fine. And that’s all that really matters.

Do you tend to judge others based on their appearance?,"This week, I learnt something about a colleague I have worked with for years that not only surprised me but also brought to the fore how cosmetic our interactions can be with people we generally spend most of our day with. It was on the Tuesday following the long Easter weekend, and since the last I’d seen him was Thursday the week before, I enquired how his Easter had been and what he did to mark the holiday.

He laughed and said, “I don’t celebrate Easter.” This profession is no respecter of holidays, unless you’re on leave or it is your off day, a holiday, any holiday, is a working day for us.

Read: The folly of modern house with big windows, no grills

I therefore assumed he meant that he worked through Easter. Since I knew his off days were Friday and Saturday, I was puzzled and enquired why he worked throughout the weekend, to which he clarified that he doesn’t celebrate Easter because he’s Muslim. I thought he was pulling my leg because, among other things, his surname is common with people who come from the Rift Valley a place he calls home, a place that he grew up in. He had been a practicing Muslim for over 20 years, he told me.

That conversation got me reflecting on how we can exist in the same space with someone for years, and talk to each other daily, yet fail to really know one another because our interactions are superficial and rarely scratch the surface.

We are satisfied with the automatic, “How are you?”, “I’m fine,” kind of interaction that, when you think about it, means nothing. That conversation nudged me to examine how I generally interact with people, (outside of my family and close friends) that I spend time with daily. I found myself wanting.

The truth is that many of us tend to make assumptions about other people based on their appearance, and how they look. How they talk, how they dress, where they live, where and what they eat, where they work, where they went to school, yet all these are general characteristics that can be quite misleading. You see a well-dressed man or woman and you assume that they must be well-off, while you are likely to view the less well-dressed ones as struggling.

Read: Thinking of visiting someone? Think twice

I was once seated in a café somewhere next to a group of young college-going girls when a woman who did not look affluent in any way walked towards this huge, gleaming, no doubt very expensive machine of a car, opened the door to the driver’s seat, got in and zoomed off, no doubt to her a house somewhere in a leafy suburb. The group exclaimed in surprise and one of the young women commented, “Aki hakai hiyo gari…” From her appearance, the woman did not look like the category of women who could afford such a car, and they wondered why anyone who could afford such a luxury car not dress to ‘match’ her car.

I have seen the same attitude in outlets that sell clothes, whether it is in one of the many boutiques around the country or high-end clothing stores. You walk in and the first thing the attendant does is look you up and down, after which he or she immediately forms an opinion about you.

In this case, whether or not you can afford what they are selling. The conclusion they form will determine how they treat you, whether they will be cold and standoffish, or whether they will be welcoming and ingratiating towards you.

Unfortunately, this is an attitude that ends up costing many business owners a significant amount of money every year, an attitude that can bring down businesses. This Sunday, should you be tempted to judge someone by appearance only, remember the saying, ‘Never judge a book by its cover’. More times than not, it rings true.

"Trump calls migrants 'animals,' intensifying focus on illegal immigration","Donald Trump called immigrants illegally in the United States ""animals"" and ""not human"" in a speech in Michigan on Tuesday, resorting to the degrading rhetoric he has employed time and again on the campaign trail.

The Republican presidential candidate, appearing with several law enforcement officers, described in detail several criminal cases involving suspects in the country illegally and warned that violence and chaos would consume America if he did not win the November 5 election.

In a later speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin, he struck a similarly foreboding tone, describing the 2024 election as the nation's ""final battle.""

While speaking of Laken Riley - a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia allegedly murdered by a Venezuelan immigrant in the country illegally - Trump said some immigrants were sub-human.

""The Democrats say, 'Please don't call them animals. They're humans.' I said, 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals,'"" said Trump, president from 2017 to 2021.

In Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump described meeting the family of Ruby Garcia, a local 25-year-old murdered last month by a suspect in the country illegally, according to police. Garcia's sister denied the former president spoke with the family, according to local media reports.

In stump speeches, Trump frequently claims that immigrants crossing the border with Mexico illegally have escaped from prisons and asylums in their home countries and are fueling violent crime in the United States.

While available data on criminals' immigration status is sparse, researchers say people living in the U.S. illegally do not commit violent crimes at a higher rate than native-born citizens.

Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump's rival in the November presidential election, accuses Trump of encouraging Republicans in Congress not to pass legislation this year that would have beefed up security at the southern border and introduced measures aimed at reducing illegal immigration.

""Donald Trump is engaging in extreme rhetoric that promotes division, hate and violence in our country,"" Michael Tyler, Biden campaign communications director, told reporters on Tuesday ahead of Trump's speeches.

Trump titled his Michigan speech ""Biden's border bloodbath,"" and said he met family members of Garcia, who was allegedly murdered last month in her car by Brandon Ortiz-Vite, 25, whom she was dating.

""They said she had just this most contagious laughter, and when she walked into a room, she lit up that room, and I've heard that from so many people. I spoke to some of her family,"" Trump said.

Mavi Garcia, Ruby Garcia's sister, disputed that account, according to local television stations.

""He did not speak with any of us, so it was kind of shocking seeing that he had said that he had spoke with us,"" Mavi Garcia was quoted as saying by a local NBC affiliate.

Reuters was not able to immediately contact Garcia's family. A Trump campaign representative declined to comment on the record.

The murders of Garcia and Riley have allowed Trump's campaign to play simultaneously to some voters' fears about violent crime and immigration.

Some 38% of Republicans cited immigration as the country's top issue in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late February, as did about one in five independents.Trump frequently claims without evidence that migrants have caused a spike in violent crime in U.S. cities. On Tuesday, he repeated an unfounded claim that Latin American nations are intentionally sending their criminals to the United States.

TUESDAY'S WISCONSIN PRIMARY

During his evening speech in Wisconsin, Trump pledged he would stop the ""plunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of our American suburbs, cities and towns.""

He also warned that the coming election could be America's last.

""This country is finished if we don't win this election,"" he said. ""And I heard somebody say ... two or three days ago, said, if we don't win, this may be the last election our country ever has. And there could be truth to it.""

Michigan and Wisconsin are two swing states that could determine whether Biden or Trump occupies the White House next year.

In the 2020 election, Biden beat Trump in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point and in Michigan by less than three. Both states are expected to be extremely close again this year.

Although both Trump and Biden have mathematically clinched their presidential nominations, they will be on their party's presidential primary ballots in Wisconsin on Tuesday.

The Biden team will be watching for protest votes by Democrats angry over the president's strong support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.

In February's presidential primary in Michigan, a state with a large Muslim population, Biden easily won the primary but more than 100,000 Democrats voted ""uncommitted,"" instead of for Biden, as a protest over his Gaza policy.

A similar option is available in Wisconsin on Tuesday. The protest campaign's goal is to get 20,682 voters to mark their ballots ""uninstructed,"" Wisconsin's version of ""uncommitted."" The number is significant because it represents Biden's winning margin over Trump in the state in 2020.

Where divorcees meet without being judged,"Support group for divorcees where no one is judged

Support group for divorcees where no one is judged

Divorce in Kenya is still considered taboo. The first question divorced individuals get from strangers who learn of their status is “Did you try everything to salvage the marriage?” However, a failed marriage does not make one a failure, because it takes two to establish a strong one. People are not possessions. Even your spouse is not yours to own, so you cannot control them.

“Everybody is just an experience for you to enjoy a moment with. And when that moment is over, let them go! It’s not the end of the world, you’re going to have another experience… and another,” says 41-year-old Christine Muthoni, a lawyer specialising in family law.

Christine has handled numerous divorce cases, child custody disputes and disagreements involving property and inheritance.

Her book, Conscious Uncoupling: A Personal Journey, was published in May 2023. In August this year, she became a certified divorce coach.

Christine got married, hoping that it would be the beginning of her “happily ever after”. When her ex-husband first brought up the divorce topic, she was shocked and in disbelief.

She resisted because there were children involved. But despite trying everything, they realised the best thing was for both to go separate ways rather than stay in an unhappy union. This was the less painful and traumatic choice. Her ex-husband suggested that she files for divorce because she was familiar with the process, and they would not have to pay another lawyer for it. But she had to find fault in him.

“If you’re looking for fault, you will find it. The other person doesn’t know their faults, and when you write about their flaws they automatically feel they need to file their own documents to set the records straight. That’s where it gets murky. And even if you did not foresee it going down that path, divorce takes a life of its own. It is never beautiful, and there’s no winner,” says Christine, adding that people process divorce differently.



Coping with isolation

If you are familiar with tools to deal with grief and get professional help in the form of therapy, then you can cope with it better. You can co-parent and even be friends once you get past the anger.

Christine learned about Oasis Experience while doing her divorce coaching certification. All participants must be divorcees. Part of the requirements was that she attends group therapy for her divorce. She wrote an e-mail to Nairobi Chapel and she was given Tony Hutia’s contact. He invited her to the graduation of the second cohort and she was amazed by the bond of the group.

Read: Unspoken trials: The stigma we faced after divorce

“It was a celebration and I was wondering, ‘People are celebrating being divorced?’,” laughs out Christine.

She was inspired by the celebration of life even after divorce, and she signed up immediately. As a divorce lawyer, she had always offered legal and sometimes emotional support to clients. Her book was being cited by therapists. She had always been the strong one. But after her first session, when she saw people talking about their experiences in a structured manner according to the workbook, she realised she had been bottling things up. She had never put herself in the position of needing help.

“I would talk so much because I had a lot to say. This is the environment for me to get help. If I’m angry, I’m going to tell them and say what I’m angry about, and nobody is going to judge me,” says Christine.

Even while happily married, Christine was not a religious person.

“Oasis is church-based and scriptural, but they discuss things the way they are in real life. They don’t preach and they didn’t condemn me. They understand there are various aspects to a human being – there is the spiritual bit but also the material bit which is what is hurting right now so badly because of divorce,” says Christine.

Oasis Experience is run by four divorce coaches – Sandro Tangut, Tony Hutia, Catherine Nyambura, Aswani Labwende – who first started divorce counselling at Nairobi Chapel on Ngong Road after their marriages fell apart.

Sandro, a business development manager in the ICT solutions-selling business, went through a divorce in 2017. During that time, he found that he did not have a place he could go to and talk about what he was feeling. At 24, he had made up his mind to spend the rest of his life with his ex-wife, so it was a shock to him when his spouse of 14 years filed for divorce.

“There was a rollercoaster of emotions when I heard, ‘We’re separating and I’m filing for divorce.’ I tried doing a lot of things, including church programmes. I thought, ‘How do I salvage this situation?’ You go looking for the best couple. If they cannot salvage things, you go looking for the relatives. Then you turn to the reverend at the church you were joined. After that, you turn to prayers and then resign to your fate. And the default for most men is turning to alcohol or looking for other women,” remembers Sandro.

Co-parenting reality

Marriage had become his identity. He did not know what going back to singlehood would look like. They had children and did everything together. His peers were also married and now he was an outcast in the group. Like a lot of people, he felt let down by the church, who after failing to reconcile the couple, had not offered much help for what was coming. In most mainstream churches, those whose marriages have collapsed are barred from serving in the church.

“The church is like a hospital. You can imagine I’m wounded then the hospital throws me out. If the church tells you ‘We cannot accommodate you’, should you go to the people of the world who are very open?” thought Sandro at the time.

He found himself at Nairobi Chapel. It is one of the few churches that has embraced divorcees and has a programme in their church. He joined the programme as a divorce care facilitator in 2019.

After processing the negative emotions, Sandro started talking about his journey on social media and attracted a lot of feedback. He felt motivated and registered for an online course on Udemy to become a certified therapist. What was supposed to be a pain, has now become a lesson for him and others. The quartet started the Oasis Experience in 2022 with Anthony, Catherine, Aswani and him as directors.

“We decided to have the setting outside of the church and help people wholesomely. We will not throw verses at you and threaten you with hell if you don’t listen to the Bible or follow the scripture, we will walk with you at your own pace until you feel healed and no longer bitter with God or the church,” says Sandro.

The programme

THE OASIS Experience is a 13-week programme that deals with relational, emotional, financial and legal issues to help divorcees financially, legally and emotionally. Financially, they teach participants how to adjust from a two-income home to a one-income household. Legally, they teach how to plan for the cases and lawyers. Emotionally, they help participants avoid sinking into depression.

Read: What does it take to file for divorce and child custody?

There is a workbook with topics that are to be covered each week. One can then journal their thoughts on specific topics. There is also a 30-minute video where those who’ve gone through divorce share their experiences on the topic being covered. There is also group therapy where members sit together and discuss their experiences, hopes and challenges.

Every last Friday of the month, they have a session called “Taboo Topics.” They pick topics which are not commonly spoken in church or different forums. One of the topics is marrying a single mother with a son. There is a big discussion in the “man-osphere” on men being told to avoid marrying single mothers.

Potluck picnics in Karura Forest or the Nairobi Arboretum are also used to break the classroom setting in between the programme.

Due to the stigma attached to divorce, most people are usually hesitant about admitting they are going through divorce. Sandro’s call to action is, “Men out there, know you’re not alone. Even as you’re walking through that separation and divorce, don’t be ashamed to stand out and say ‘My marriage has ended and I’m grieving’.” There are spaces where you can sit with other men and they’ll walk with you, and you will not be ashamed.

“At the end of the day, we are human and have emotions. Most men who don’t seek help end up killing their wives or children for revenge. Some people even gone through saddening experiences that when you listen to them, you realise that what you’re going through is not as big an issue.”



Finding self

Tony works in the ICT world and does a lot of mentorship for boys and men. He was married for 10 years before separating with his ex-wife in 2012. Last year, he decided to get support in terms of group therapy. A lot of Oasis Experience’s members are leaders in various corporates and often take a failed marriage harder than failing a career-defining project.

“In corporate, you can follow those five key steps (structure, culture, power and influence, identity and guiding principles) to reinvent and rebuild yourself, but nobody thinks about it deliberately in marriage. How do you turn that lemon and make lemonade,” asks Tony.

He says lots of marriages fail because, unlike work, people don’t deliberately think about what it takes to make marriage work. Men can lead in many other areas of life but don’t do the same in their homes and instead, relegate that role to their wives. Research shows that divorce is particularly devastating to successful people.

“Nobody takes you through that process of you growing from a boy, to a man, and then a father. You expect it to be natural because you consider yourself a man. But you go for training and capacity building for any other thing to better your career skills. You gain the whole world and lose your soul, yet the soul is core,” says Tony, adding that men have been made to understand that (financial) provision is their sole responsibility in the relationship while leaving out things like guidance, leadership and support.

Tony says he got into mentoring because he realised that he is perfect only in the things his father taught him, like how to work hard and make nyama choma. He cannot remember being taught anything about relationships by his father.

“Most people who come for divorce therapy think they know and can do it without help because men are always told to ‘soldier on’. I tried to do facilitations for “Man Enough” and I could see it. I thought the best place to start from is going a level down and start with the young men. Capture them early to make them better people,” says Tony.

He holds three-day camps for boys (from when they are eight years old until they undergo circumcision) at a resort he owns and they encourage fathers to spend the last night with their sons to discuss what they’ve learnt.

Sandro and Tony went on to take a second shot at marriage and family life. They call themselves “two-star generals”.

Sandro tied the knot again in 2020 and has a one-year-old daughter. He had three sons in his previous marriage. Tony got into a new relationship while he was still going through the divorce from his first wife, and has been married for nine years. He has a son and a daughter in his second marriage, similar to the first.

He was a couple’s counsellor in his previous church and was asked to step down after his divorce. His married friends were asked to keep away from him by their spouses. Tony says he had to take his mind out of “revenging against this one woman on every other woman.” He realised that while he was single he would be spending money on all these women and put himself at risk of sexually transmitted diseases. He was also putting himself in a position of possibly fathering children with multiple women. Everyone wanted something from him, yet he had gotten married so that someone would help him.

“You can only help in areas that you’re strong in. I wanted someone that would have my back as I’m building my kingdom,” says Tony.

Catherine, an interior designer, has never tried marriage again 11 years after her 14-year marriage ended. The counselling psychologist, who is a mother to two adult sons and recently a grandmother, wanted to be part of a tribe where she would not have to explain herself much while talking about challenges she faced with co-parenting and blended families. She and her husband mutually agreed to divorce.

“You come to a point where nothing makes sense. You don’t share the same parental skills, view family and marriage differently, and have different financial and religious values. As priorities change and you grow older, you grow apart,” says Catherine.

Although her husband was a good provider and took good care of them, Catherine decided to take her children and provide for them. It was scary at first, because she moved from a house they owned and had to start paying rent, and from a two-income household to being the sole breadwinner. It was difficult but she was able to do it with her family’s help. She has always been at Nairobi Chapel and was among the first cohort to benefit from the divorce counselling ministry at the church.



Healing

“Those who went through a divorce before me are surprised because they never got that help. In church, we would have to counsel men and women separately, but at Oasis we meet together. We want both parties to understand what the other side is going through, otherwise, we’ll just be “daughters of Jezebel” and they will be “sons of Adam”. We encourage friendships even after the class to make remarrying possible,” says Catherine, adding that the key to healing after divorce is vulnerability and being ready to try again.

Aswani is a ghostwriter. She is the newest kid on the block when it comes to being divorced. Describing herself as “divorced then but now single”, she was married in 2016, separated in 2019, and filed for divorce in 2021 and it took six months to finalise.

Most religions including Christianity encourage reconciliation or enduring difficult situations in marriage, and women are especially burdened with the task of “keeping the family together”.

Having done a white wedding, Aswani says that she had 450 witnesses to her failure. She was walking around with this aura of anger and people would even keep away. She couldn’t talk about how she truly felt in the church set-up. Other coping mechanisms that many divorcees use like rebound sex or drinking (self-medication) are taboo to talk about even in society.

“If you mention these, you will attract condemnation. But at Oasis we talk about the things that are happening on the ground without judging. And it’s not just about the extremes, it could be you’re just picking fights with others. But at the end of the day, we will bring Christ in a way that is relatable to us,” says Aswani.

The Oasis Experience classes are run from Weal House every Saturday. They are also currently working on a counselling experience for children of divorced parents.

Men enjoy a genuine public display of love,"Several days ago, on the main road that leads to my home, I saw people rubbernecking at a Muslim couple.

The woman, in a hijab, was tying the man's shoelaces. I guess that on their journey to wherever, the man's sneakers’ laces came untied and the woman — (perhaps his wife) — was just being loving and dutiful.

I did not think much about it. But it's the stares and comments from some members of the public that caused me to deeply think about this random public display of service.

“Mimi, hata na dawa, siwezi kufanya mtumwa na mwanaume,” (I cannot do that for a man) one woman muttered to her friend, glaring at the dutiful Muslim woman as if she was committing treason.

“Wanaume ni wale wale!” (Men are the same)

“Huyo inaonekana hajapata (this one is yet to get) character development,” her friend chimed.

Well, these are the same women you will see going down on bended knees, in public, on dirty sidewalks, bouquets in hand, when they welcome their “man of God”.

Service and servitude

These types of women only draw a line in the sand when it comes to serving their husbands. But when it comes to their “man of God”, they will serve him everything.

It's these types of women — who are fallacy personified — who will bow to their bosses, be at their beck and call, and work their fingers to the bone for their bosses; yet give their man the middle finger when he requests for a back scratch after a hard day’s work.

The definition of service is an act of assistance to someone. On the other hand, servitude is the state of being a slave or being forced to work for others or do their bidding without one's consent or against one's will, either in perpetuity or for a period over which one has little or no control.

Some sisters fail to differentiate between service and servitude. I don't blame all of you, though. Some sisters were abused in relationships, which made them loathe the very thought of being in service to a man. But others have fallen victim to hate that's been spewed against all men.

When couples have spontaneous public displays of service — without compulsion or coercion — it shows their love is deep. These spontaneous displays can be seen, for instance, when a man adjusts his woman's out-of-place lock of hair.

This spontaneous display was demonstrated about eight years ago by President Barack Obama when she guarded First Lady Michelle Obama’s dignity, as they were boarding Air Force One while jetting from their holiday in Hawaii.

Public perceptions

Michelle was wearing a wavy blue dress. A gust of wind blew her dress, but Obama, being the consummate gentleman, put her right hand over so slightly over her back.

A weaker man would've gone: “Deal with it, baby; your dress, your choice.”

These spontaneous displays can be seen when a woman adjusts her man's tie or licks her forefinger and then rolls it down her man's eyebrows.

Here's the thing. For a partner to bend low — literally and figuratively — and be of service to their better half in public, shows they are confident in their place in the relationship.

It also shows they have built their relationship over time — mostly in secret spaces — to an extent that when there is a need for service, there are no second thoughts or long-drawn deliberations, either openly or in their minds. They just do it. They are not (mis)led by public perceptions.

Kudos to y'all who are about public displays of service.

Who said cleaning and cooking is only the woman’s role?,"Recently, I was caught up in an interesting debate online. It centered on the roles of a husband and wife in a marriage.

“Marriage no longer comes with a job description or manual as it did in the older days,” Ann Wambui, a reader said.

“Husbands went out to work and provided for the family while wives stayed at home and raised children. Everyone was happy,” she went on.

But things have since changed, it was noted.

Another reader Kenneth Sang’ weighed in: “Today, things are different. You will die hustling if your wife has no income to complement yours. And there is also the harsh reality that women are bringing home the bigger bacon!”

While Kenneth insisted that the traditional roles of a husband and wife were no longer tenable, Neema Njeri disagreed.

“Nothing has changed. A woman is a nurturer and gifted with homemaking skills. Only a lazy man depends on his wife for provision,” Neema said.

Struggle with adjusting in marriage

David Muema, a self-proclaimed marriage counsellor, had a sober argument.

“After more than two decades of what I consider a happy marriage, and after counselling many couples, I have concluded that, other than the obvious biological distinctions, such as who should breastfeed a child, the other roles are purely manmade. Each couple should craft the roles that work for them, and not what society dictates,” he said.

Silus Wanjala, a reader, shed light on why couples, especially the newlyweds struggle with adjusting in a marriage.

“They are trying to figure out their respective roles,” he said.

He noted that submission was misunderstood by husbands and wives.

“Some husbands take advantage of the submissive wife. Marriage is about teamwork, with each partner playing their part,” Silus said.

While Silus expounded on the Biblical meaning of submission, he cautioned wives against mistaking it to mean being subservient.

“Some women mistake submission to mean being a ‘yes’ woman, which makes it an unappealing idea. No human is inferior to the other.”

Roles of husband and wife

Silus explained that submission simply means, “Allowing your husband to lead, as you remain the greatest team player.”

Silus noted that there are roles that come naturally to either of the couples, which means that they automatically fall into a routine.

“Women are good at planning and organising finances and stuff. Men are not. That’s why you will see a man always asking where his socks, boxers, and shirts are,” Silus says.

Some people are clear about who does what in a marriage. Woe unto them when they get married and discover that their spouse has a different worldview on such roles.

Simon, a blogger once posted, “I have moved houses and now need a wife to sort the curtains and other house matters.”

And the response from readers was swift and brutal.

“Is a wife a maid? A curtain fundi or tailor?” said one reader.

What came out clearly from the debate is that the roles of husband and wife need to be complementary.

Complementarian principles

Focus on The Family, a platform dedicated to strengthening families, defines the complementarian principles thus, ‘it means that husbands and wives embrace roles that are intrinsically equal in worth and value but distinct and unique in design, role, and function. One isn’t better than the other; they complete or complement each other.’

To avoid unnecessary power struggles, the complementarian teaching advances that, ultimately, each should strive to serve the other.

The idea is to focus on each other's needs and best interests.

Complementarians view marriage as a team effort.

The husband takes on a servant leadership role, using his strength to love and protect, while the wife uses her nurturing strength and wisdom to advise and encourage.

Complementarianism considers the submission of each spouse to the other.

Biblical submission never dominates, demeans, demands, or abuses another person. It does not require spouses to deny their gift or personality or shut off their intellect.

Biblical submission is about treasuring the other person.

Why land in Nairobi's high-end estates is losing appeal,"

House rental prices in Kitisuru have, for instance, contracted in each of the last five years while apartment selling prices have slumped by the same measure across Kilimani, Lavington, and Riverside. Land prices in the lucrative nodes of Riverside and Upperhill have also contracted in each of the last five years.

Crews take stock of performance as the dust settles on Safari Rally,"Kalle Rovanpera of Finland returns home a hero as the FIA observer prepares his post mortem report on the World Rally Championship Safari Rally.

Manufacturers, drivers and fans are also taking stock of the competition, which took place from March 28-31 in Nairobi and Naivasha. Toyota’s Kalle Rovanpera and his co-driver Jonne Halttunen won the Safari Rally on Sunday, with Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville stretching his championship lead to six points despite finishing only fifth.

Double world champion Rovanpera, competing in selected events only this season before a full return next year, led from Friday and finished one minute and 37.8 seconds clear of his team mate Takamoto Katsuta over the rough gravel roads.

M-Sport Ford’s Adrien Fourmaux finished third. Toyota lead Hyundai by four points in the manufacturers’ championship, and the next round is in Croatia, on asphalt, from April 18-21.

Although this year’s competition lacked the buzz of the last two editions, for Rovanpera, his co-driver Jonne Halttunen, and the Toyota team, the harvest in Kenya was bountiful.

Rovanpera won his second WRC Safari Rally title in a Toyota Yaris GR Hybrid two years his first after four days of relentless competition in Nairobi, Naivasha and Gilgil.

This was yet another successful round of the FIA World Championship, which this year had the distinction of promoting the beautiful images of Kenya as a tourism destination in 50 countries through 150 stations, reaching 82 million people.

The Safari Rally was brought forward to Easter holidays from June to recreate a historic past when nothing else mattered in East Africa around that time. It was meant to attract more fans, and to avoid disrupting normal life, given that previous editions held since 2021 have witnessed traffic snarl up on all roads leading to, and from Naivasha.

Carl Tundo and his navigator Tim Jessop, driving a Ford Fiesta car, were the highest placed Kenyans in 16th place in the main World Rally Championship (WRC), but they were seventh in the Rally 2 category, and came out top of the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC) category.

Reigning Africa Rally Championship winner, Karan Patel, was 18th overall, having retired on Saturday but re-joined the rally on Sunday after mechanics fixed the strut in his Skoda Fabia car.

“I am happy with my performance in the Safari Rally, and I feel encouraged to compete once again in the Africa Rally Championship series,” Patel said.

He was followed by Aakif Virani (Skoda Fabia) and Minesh Rathod (Mitsubishi Lancer EVO) in the main WRC category.

A senior Executive of the WRC Promoter, the German-based commercial rights holder of the FIA WRC, Peter Thul, estimated that the Safari Rally will have realised or exceeded its media commercial value, which is estimated at over Sh4 billion, following concerted effort with the Kenyan government to create pre-event media publicity. Top drivers visited the Masai Mara and shared their experiences with millions of fans around the world on social media.

In addition, Thul said the WRC and FIA are very much willing to remain in Kenya as the Safari Rally is a unique event in the 13-rounds WRC calendar, and the only one in Africa as they have financial guarantees from the government, and aspirations for growth in the corporate sector which came through commercial sponsorship for the event and drivers.

The KCB Bank, Toyota Kenya, Safaricom and Betika were some of the sponsors who supported the event and drivers, led by Carl Tundo who finished 16th overall in the main World Rally Championship category, and seventh in the Rally 2 category.

Rovanpera, twice youngest world champion ever at age 24, drove through the 367km competitive distance after taking the lead on Friday from Belgian Thierry Neuville, driving a Hyundai i20 Hybrid Rally1 car. Neuville had won the Kasarani Super Special Stage on Thursday by winning all the six stages of the day.

He started the day with a lead of over 2 minutes 55 seconds over team mate Takamoto Katsuta and still managed to ease off to safeguard his lead despite team Katsuta closing in but could only manage to reduce this gap to 1:37.8 minutes.

“Lottery stage,” said Katsuta after a puncture at Malewa morning stage which affected his challenge to Rovanpera “Quite stupid to be honest.""

Frenchman Adrien Fourmaux completed the podium and gave M-Sport Ford a morale boosting third position and their first podium finish in 22 years since the late Colin McRae won the 2002 Safari Rally in a Ford Focus.

The young Frenchman, 29, has also been sponsored by Mpesa Global and Kenya Airways. He will be flying colours of both companies in the WRC remaining 10 rounds.

Toyota's Elfyn Evans finished fourth followed by Neuville. Thierry Neuville, who had started the Safari on a promising note but mechanical issues dogged him throughout the rally. He was unable to pick maximum points on Sunday following an impact with a rock, which broke the right-rear suspension on his Hyundai i20 N Rally1 at Hells Gate.

“Impossible to avoid,” Neuville lamented. “I don’t know where they come from but they were massive, two of them.”

Title rival Evans is set to benefit from Neuville’s trouble. But he had sympathy for Neuville’s situation: “It’s a shame. Sometimes it’s a bit of a lottery like that.”

The Safari was divided into three categories--World Rally Championship for Priority 1 drivers; World Rally Championship for Priority 2 drivers; Kenya National Rally Championship for local drivers who do not have modern machines. They competed in only one loop daily of the two loops rally in Kedong/Geothermal/Loldia stages on Friday.

Leg Two was at Soysambu/Elementaita and Sleeping Warrior in Gilgil and Leg three on Sunday at Malewa/Oserian/Hells Gate.

Why Safari Rally winner Rovanpera will not earn prize money,"Kalle Rovanpera was awarded a wooden carving valued at Sh25,000 for winning the 2024 WRC Safari Rally, and celebrated his victory with alcohol-free champagne.

Kenyans have been wondering how one can risk his life, expend too much energy for a wooden carving, noting that it has never been disclosed how much is the prize money for the Safari compared to other local events like the Magical Kenya Open which offers the winner $425,000(Sh55 million) from US$2.5 million (Sh325 million) kitty, Kip Keino Classic Continental Tour and city marathon races.

For a start, there is no prize money on offer in the Safari Rally or national championship events. Instead one is expected to pay between Sh15,000 to Sh50,000 entry fees. You either have old money or should seek sponsors because motorsport is all about business.

But motorsport at the highest level is like any other profession where workers are paid a monthly salary and performance bonuses. They are encouraged to seek endorsements and individual commercial sponsors.

But unlike in other professional sports, rally drivers remuneration is never disclosed to the public. It is an agreement between them and their teams. However, once in a while, drivers disclose their financial worth with the sponsors.

For example, Safaricom Mpesa Global announced a Sh20 million sponsorship for Ford driver Adrien Fourmaux to fly the Mpesa logo in the Safari and 10 other events this year.

However, Colin McRae’s move from Subaru for Ford was reportedly to have cost Ford £6 million (Sh668M) in salaries in 1999, the last publicly disclosed salary for a rally driver.

Since inception, the Safari Rally was not about money. The Safari was born at a bar in Limuru when the two gentlemen Eric Cecil and Vincent Niel decided to do a long distance event for the fun of it.

Thereafter local car franchises adopted the Safari as a marketing tool for their products and initially companies like Marshals East Africa and DT Dobie gave their workshop managers vehicles to drive in the Safari as part of marketing strategies.

But gradually drivers like Shekhar Mehta, Joginder Singh and Vic Preston Junior were identified for such missions before they were snapped by manufacturer teams who started paying them money.

So how much does a top rally driver earn without prize money? Nation Sport combed through the internet and found out that rally drivers are some of the best paid professionals.

A website (Rally Sports) revealed the salary of the driver according to them in which 2023 Safari champion Sebastien Ogier tops the list with annual pay of US$2.5 million (Sh325 million), Thierry Neuville (Sh260 million), and Sébastien Loeb (Sh195 million).

But all these remain estimates minus official communication. Patrick Njiru at his prime was earning Sh8.5 million from BAT sponsorship annually between 1995-97.

The fans also have been asking why the WRC is competed by hatch back cars and not salons.

The website explained that manufacturers rally cars to market and sell cars, and right now hatchbacks are the preferred vehicles in Europe

Hatchbacks have shorter length than sedans, which gives slightly more advantage for agility. Other than that, rally cars use compact sized cars and the majority of the compact cars sold in Europe are hatchbacks, so they use the hatchback models to promote the models to the masses.

Help those struggling with depression amongst us to heal,"The two brothers who reportedly committed suicide in Narok County by hanging themselves due to family issues sparked discussions and emotions in the country. They are just among the many who commit suicide due to depression, calling for decisive actions to combat these cases.

The World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2019 data show about 20 per cent of youth suffer from mental conditions. And there has been a 13 per cent rise in issues like suicide, depression, stress and substance abuse.

The Kenya National Commission of Human Rights reports that about 25 per cent of in-patients suffer from mental conditions. This highlights the urgent need for substantial action to bridge these gaps to prevent losing lives that could be saved.

Many of these cases stem from tough economic times, especially with the significant rise in the cost of living in recent years. The economic strain has pushed individuals into unexpected conditions due to stress and depression, increasing the likelihood of mental health issues. Some 20 per cent of youth turn to drugs, often leading to addiction and subsequent mental decline.

Mental healthcare facilities must undergo thorough quality inspection to ensure a conducive physical and social environment for patients. Improving them will streamline services for outpatients, who are often more challenging to deal with. Maximum resource allocation to mental healthcare should be prioritised.

Counselling departments and rehabilitation centres must be enhanced as youth and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these conditions.

Taking action to raise general awareness is another effective way to ensure adherence to health protocols. The Health ministry should be proactive in ensuring full implementation of these actions to address the issues before they escalate further.

Mental health organisations should advocate prompt reporting whenever such indicators are observed. Lastly, mental conditions can never justify violation of human rights or denying individuals full access to freedom.

"Tundo, Anwar battle big boys to give Safari Rally local flavour","Carl Tundo and Hamza Anwar were the biggest local winners of the 2024 WRC Safari Rally after pushing on regardless of the many hurdles they encountered to score points in the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC) series, and the Junior World Rally Championship (JWRC) respectively.

Toyota’s Kalle Rovanpera and co-driver Jonne Halttunen won the WRC Safari Rally, with Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville stretching his championship lead to six points despite finishing only fifth.

Double world champion Rovanpera, competing in selected events only this season before a full return next year, led from Friday and finished one minute and 37.8 seconds clear of team mate Takamoto Katsuta over the rough gravel roads. M-Sport Ford’s Adrien Fourmaux finished third.

Tundo, navigated by Tim Jessop, struggled with punctures on Saturday but their resilience paid off on Sunday as they finished 16th overall, and 17th in Rally 2 category in a Ford Fiesta car, giving the Safari Rally a Kenyan flavour.

Tundo, who has had a limited rally programme since his semi-retirement in 2021, said he was happy to battle the big boys but he never really had the opportunity to mount a serious challenge for the title.

“After suffering punctures on Friday and Saturday, all I wanted was a finish,” Tundo told Nation Sport on Sunday.

Anwar was Kenya’s only entrant in the Rally 3 category of the Safari Rally, driving a Ford Fiesta car. Despite struggling with many mechanical problems, he still managed to return to the finish in 22nd position overall. Afterwards, he expressed joy at having overcome retirement to rejoin the Safari Rally and score maximum points.

Unfortunately, Anwar, who competed in five JWRC events last year and became the third most improved driver in the world last year, was not registered to compete in this year's edition.

African champion Karan Patel was 18th overall after retiring on Saturday and rejoining the rally on Sunday after mechanics had fixed the strut in his Skoda Fabia car.

“I am happy and encouraged to compete again in the African Rally Championship,” Karan, who will be supported by KCB Bank, said. He was followed by Aakif Virani (Skoda Fabia) and Minesh Rathod (Mitsubishi Lancer EVO) in the main WRC.

The Rally 2 title was won by Britain’s Gus Greensmith in a Skoda Fabia car. He managed to squeeze himself in the main Rally 1 category and finished seventh overall, followed by Swedish Oliver Solberg in a similar car.

Greensmith drove with flu-like symptoms but never relented even as Solberg breathed down his neck as he opened a three-minute lead on Friday and remained put until he closed the finish line on Sunday.

Greensmith got his WRC2 campaign off to the perfect start after winning the FIA World Rally Championship’s premier support category by 1m 23.1 in his Škoda Fabia RS Rally over Solberg.

Solberg suffered a couple of punctures but enjoyed the consolation of winning 11 of the rally’s 19 stages. However, he failed to cancel the deficit behind Greensmith as competitive mileage dwindled yesterday in the 74km-long final day’s action.

Solberg posted the fastest time in the Wolf Power Stage, extending his lead in the championship. He finished more than seven minutes clear of third-placed Fabia man Kajetan Kajetanowicz, who also took the spoils in WRC2 Challenger.

“I don’t know what I’m more proud of, whether not giving up on Friday, or winning the category of the rally,” Greensmith said at the end.

“It's been a long week but I'm really, really happy. I say thank you to the (Toksport) team this weekend, they've been perfect.”

Safari Rally debutants Nicolas Ciamin and Charles Munster placed fourth and fifth respectively, both driving Hyundai i20 N Rally2 cars. Behind them was Daniel Chwist, followed by local driver Carl Tundo, winner in the WRC Masters Cup contingent.

Greensmith took full advantage of the mighty lead he’d built over the previous day, taking minimal risks to avoid damaging his tyres on Kenya’s rock-strewn roads. He dropped time to his Toksport Škoda Fabia RS Rally2 team-mate Oliver Solberg, who was hampered by tyre troubles on Friday, across all but one stage but still reached the overnight halt 1m 55.0s clear of the Swede.

“It's been fine today, I am feeling better now,” Greensmith confirmed.

“We took the last one nice and easy because we knew it was going to be rough, and it made no sense to lose time changing a tyre. Nothing was more physically demanding than yesterday - today, in comparison, was a walk in the park.”

Thinking of visiting someone? Think twice,"“Caro, you have to write about what happened to me last Sunday,” a colleague greeted me almost immediately after I walked into the office. Ladies and gentlemen, sustaining a column for over 10 years is not easy, especially when readers, (and your employer) expect you to write about a ‘fresh’ topic every week.

I therefore get excited when family, friends, colleagues, and even readers, give me ideas for my next column. I therefore braked immediately and headed to her desk. I stopped so abruptly, that if was I driving a car, the car behind me would have rear-ended me.

So here’s what happened to her. Last Sunday, it was past 1pm, she informed me, she received a phone call. She thought twice about picking up the call because she was exhausted, and all that she wanted to do that day was switch between watching TV and taking naps on the sofa.

Her son had had a road accident a few weeks before and had fractured an arm. He was, therefore, unable to do the chores he normally did, such as cooking and cleaning, when his mother worked late, which was often.

After weeks of working a whole day and then returning home to chores, my colleague was tired and wanted to just sit and do nothing on that day. Reluctantly, she decided to pick up the call. It was a nephew calling her, “Auntie, niko hapa chini, soldier amesema uko kwasababu gari yako iko parking…” The young man informed her that he was downstairs, and was sure that she was in the house because the watchman had informed him her car was still in the parking lot. How would you react to such a final statement?

My colleague felt her blood pressure begin to rise, and so many things went through her mind, including how she would slowly kill the watchman later.

Feeling trapped, she informed her nephew that yes, she was in. She lives on the second floor of an apartment building and figured that by the time her surprise visitor cleared the two flights of stairs, she would have changed out of her nightdress. When she opened the door to admit the young man, she got the surprise of her life. Standing next to him wearing a sheepish smile on her face was a young woman she had never seen holding an infant in her arms.

He would later introduce her as his wife – she had given birth to their child three months ago. “We’re from church, my wife suggested that we come visit you since she keeps hearing about you but has never met you,” he explained, even though, my colleague said, she suspects that this was a lie since the young woman quickly looked down in embarrassment following this statement.

To cut a long story short, being a typical African, she went to the kitchen and prepared them a meal since she and her son had already had lunch.

She served them, while trying very hard, being the host, to keep the conversation going since she and her nephew were not especially close and therefore unfamiliar with what was going on in each other’s lives, while she knew nothing about his new wife. It was an awkward afternoon that spilt into the late evening since her surprise visitors were in no hurry to leave.

When they finally bade her goodbye a few minutes to 7 pm, my colleague collapsed on the sofa from physical and mental exhaustion and blacked out, coming to at around 10pm, after which she dragged herself to bed, already dreading Monday.

Her appeal was short, “Please tell people that it is rude and inconsiderate to turn up on people’s doorsteps unannounced.”

Growing up in the rural area, it was common for neighbours to visit one another at all hours of the day without announcing it, but I guess that then, it was acceptable because the said visitors did not expect a buffet and would not begrudge you if you served them ‘strong tea’ or tea without sugar and would be totally fine with a glass of cold water. Things are different in urban areas though, as many put it, “Maisha hapa ni ngumu”.

Everything is budgeted for, this, coupled with the fact that everyone is busy trying to make a living, such visits are frowned on. So please, if you’re not especially close to the one you plan to ‘surprise’ this Sunday after church, think twice.

Learn to choose your battles wisely in your love life,"Some people cope well with life’s irritations while others panic. Don’t be one of those. The stress will eventually ruin your health, your career and your relationships. Instead, recognise which battles you should fight, and which you shouldn’t and learn to react better to setbacks.

So any time you feel an argument coming on, ask yourself whether the situation is really important enough for a confrontation. And whatever you do, don’t start getting riled up until you’ve decided how to deal with the issue because not all problems are equal. Some don’t matter at all, especially in the long run, while some seem crucial at the time, but the emotional effort involved is too great.

Only fight battles where the benefits outweigh the costs. Which never includes fighting with someone who is going to be out of your life anyway in a few minutes! And as writer Dale Carnegie said, ‘picking your battles is impressive.’

This is because if you only confront people over important issues, you’ll be taken seriously, while if you fight over everything you’ll just be seen as a troublemaker. So start reframing minor irritations.

Like seeing an annoying delay as a chance to relax, instead of a waste of time. And by asking whether the situation really is that critical.

Will it matter in a year’s time? Almost certainly not. Recognise that most events are insignificant, so it’s how you react to them that really counts. Try agreeing more in arguments. You may learn something, and your relationships will definitely improve. If you’re being criticised, try agreeing with the criticism. You’ll stop feeling insulted and there won’t be an argument.

When faced with a problem you can’t solve, or are afraid of, start by tackling it in short bursts. Your subconscious will work on the problem in the background, and the solution will likely just pop into your head. Or maybe you’re just a perpetual worrier? Don’t try to suppress your worries.

Instead, give them your full attention for five minutes, and then decide to put them aside and revisit them at a specific time later. Postponing your worries means you’re controlling them, rather than letting them control you.

Not sweating the small stuff is especially important in relationships because if you’re endlessly arguing about small stuff, like tidying the bathroom, then that’s probably a sign that your relationship may not work out.

Only fight battles that have serious, long-term implications, let everything else go, and learn to enjoy the differences between you because most relationships aren’t ended by a single incident, instead, they’re slowly swamped by endless mindless bickering.

It is therefore important to figure out what your triggers are, and decide to ignore them. Learn what really annoys your partner, and stop doing it.

Learn how to compromise gracefully, and as in all the other aspects of your life, focus your energy into identifying what the real problems are and fixing them. And leave the small stuff to take care of itself, you will be much happier, and so will your spouse.

Silent killer: Kenyans struggle with daily dose of toxic air,"Imagine this: You step outside your house, ready to start the day. But instead of the crisp morning air you crave, you are greeted by a thick, acrid mix of exhaust fumes and smoke that sends you into a coughing fit. Annoyance prickles at you – is this the air you must breathe daily?

This experience is all too familiar for Mary Njoki, a resident of Mathare slums. The community health promoter has been tethered to an inhaler for the past five years. ""I cannot leave the house without it,"" she says.

Mary's troubles began when she opened a roadside stall near a matatu drop-off point in Mathare. At the market, proper waste disposal and burning were non-existent, adding to the noxious air. Daily, she inhaled a toxic cocktail of dust and vehicle exhaust.

A new report jointly launched by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) shows that heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) such as trucks and buses are heavy emitters. Kenya is the second largest exporter of HDVs in East Africa after Burundi.

""If you have ever walked behind a big heavy truck, you may have smelled the nasty fumes billowing from its exhaust. Now, imagine standing next to such fumes all day?"" She sighs. ""I remember that the issue of polluted air was a constant conversation among us roadside sellers, and we wondered how long we would breathe the polluted air. I didn't know it would scar me for life,"" she says.

WHO estimates that seven million people die prematurely yearly due to air pollution, with half of this due to outdoor air pollution.

Her health issues began with a persistent cough and chest pains. Despite multiple trips to the hospital and treatment for recurring respiratory infections, the 62-year-old was ultimately diagnosed with asthma, a lung condition that makes breathing more difficult. Her doctor prescribed an inhaler and advised her to either relocate her business or cease operations altogether to preserve her health. She ultimately chose to close her shop and transitioned to working full-time as a health promoter.

Back home, the situation was the same. The smoke from her charcoal stove, a common feature in many Kenyan households, stung her eyes and irritated her throat. Lower-income groups in Nairobi's informal settlements like Mathare, where Mary lives, heavily rely on solid fuels like charcoal, classified as dirty fuels that release pollutants like smoke and dust when burnt.

""After many months of saving, I switched to cooking with gas, and I advocate for the same to the residents here,"" she says. Mary and other women under Groots Kenya work to raise awareness about cleaner cooking alternatives and reduce air pollution in the slums.

Yet, Mary's story isn't unique. Across Kenya, various towns are grappling with their own air pollution cocktails. Multiple studies reveal a rapid decline in outdoor air quality, raising health concerns.

Recently, IQAir released 2023's World Air Quality Report, finding that millions of people live with and breathe polluted air. The report ranks 134 countries across 7,748 locations using data from over 30,000 air quality monitoring stations around the globe. WHO estimates that seven million people die prematurely yearly due to air pollution, with half of this due to outdoor air pollution.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) measures air pollution to understand its severity. This index considers various pollutant concentrations and assigns a numerical value. Higher AQIs indicate greater air pollution and potential health risks.

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies PM2.5 fine particulate matter as the most hazardous pollutant as it gets deep into our lungs and causes health problems. Measured in micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³), PM2.5 is one of the six common pollutants monitored and regulated by environmental agencies worldwide due to the significant impacts on human health and the environment. Other pollutants include ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and lead). According to WHO, air is healthiest when these particles are below 5 µg/m3. That's like saying there should be less than five tiny specks in every breath of air you take throughout the year.

Moses Njeru, an air quality researcher at the University of Nairobi, terms air pollution as a lurking danger. Vehicle emissions, industrial facilities, burning waste and dust storms contribute to this toxic mix.

""PM2.5 fine particulate matter are particles a fraction the size of human hair that can be inhaled and often find their way into the deep lungs and even the bloodstream. Studies have shown links to strokes, heart diseases, neurological diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and other health-related conditions,"" he offers.

The pollutants, he says, can come from various sources, including vehicle emissions, industrial facilities, burning waste, and dust storms.

PM2.5 particles, caused mainly by fossil fuel emissions, affect human health and environmental processes like climate change. Only 10 of 134 countries met WHO's annual PM2.5 guidelines in 2023.

IQAir ranked Nairobi as the 79th most polluted city globally. Bangladesh is the world's most polluted country, while Burkina Faso is the most polluted in Africa. The report is based on data from 24 out of 54 Sub-Saharan African countries, indicating the need for more comprehensive air quality insights.

""Five cities in Kenya met the criteria for inclusion in the 2023 World Air Quality Report. ""Data shows improved PM2.5 levels in Nakuru, Kapsabet and Nairobi over the past year. This year marks the fourth consecutive year for PM2.5 improvements in the capital city of Nairobi, which boasts the second-largest network coverage of air quality monitors among African cities,"" says Dr Christi Chester-Schroeder, an air quality science manager.

Here is the not-so-good news: only about nine per cent of cities worldwide have clean air. IQAir found that the cities with the worst air were New Delhi, Dhaka, Ouagadougou, Dushanbe, and Baghdad. Capitals with the lowest concentrations of PM2.5 were mainly in Oceania, Scandinavia and the Caribbean.

A recent Clean Air Fund report warns that without crucial urban development interventions, the economic cost of air pollution in six rapidly growing cities, including Nairobi, could reach a staggering Sh19 trillion by 2040.

Mr Njeru and his team from the University of Nairobi have deployed air quality monitors across Kenya to verify air quality data. ""Given the diverse micro-environments, we need comprehensive data,"" he explains. Monitors are placed in residential areas, suburbs, industrial zones, forested areas, and the central business district (CBD) to capture pollution variations.

The verdict: Kenyans are breathing unsafe air. Research reveals ""hotspots""—areas with elevated PM2.5 pollution, particularly in high-traffic zones, informal settlements and industrial regions. The CBD experiences spikes during rush hour. ""Our research, in particular, shows the guidelines have exceeded even three times in some areas,"" he says.

While PM2.5 poses direct health risks, Moses says its implications extend beyond human health to climate change, which is primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions.

""For centuries, air pollution has been a silent killer. It was not until the Great London Smog of the 1950s that enough noise was made after thousands of people died prematurely in Europe. This led to a call for regulation and the birth of the famous Clean Air Act, whose mission was to control common pollutants,"" says the researcher.

"Trump can't match Biden's 2024 fundraising, Republican's campaign says","Donald Trump will be unable to match President Joe Biden's fundraising totals in this year's presidential election race, the Republican candidate's campaign said on Thursday.

""We're never gonna be able to raise dollar for dollar with Biden,"" a Trump campaign adviser said in a call with reporters.

The adviser blamed the fundraising disparity on ""billionaire"" supporters of the Democratic president, and appeared keen to paint a picture of a Trump campaign fueled by grassroots, working-class supporters.

A second campaign adviser said Trump's campaign is ""fueled by hundreds of thousands of grassroots contributors across the country, and I'd much rather have that because each one of those votes.""

Asked for a response, Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said: ""Trump's campaign is strapped for cash.""

Democratic candidates have raised more money in support of their White House bids than their Republican counterparts in all election cycles after 2004. Money, however is not always an indication of success; Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though she raised far more cash than he did.

Biden has been routinely outraising former President Trump, whose campaign, together with a joint fundraising committee, pulled in $20.3 million in February compared with the more than $53 million raised by Biden's reelection effort that month.

Large contributions make up about 55% of the $128.7 million that Biden's campaign committee has raised so far in the election cycle, OpenSecrets data showed, compared with 45% from small contributions.

For Trump, large contributions comprise 64% of the $96.1 million his campaign committee has raised, versus 36% from small contributions.

The two face a Nov. 5 general election rematch, in a race that opinion polls suggest will be extremely close.

Biden was holding a star-studded fundraiser in New York on Thursday night with his Democratic predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton that his campaign said has already raised $25 million.

The Trump campaign is due to hold a fundraiser on April 6 hosted by billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson in south Florida that aims to bring in $33 million, according to a person familiar with the event.

The Trump advisers on Thursday said that together with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will be opening dozens of offices and hiring hundreds of staff in the next few weeks, as they ramp up their general election infrastructure now that Trump has become the Republican Party's presidential candidate.

Trump cemented his grip over the RNC in March when a loyalist, his daughter-in-law, and a senior campaign adviser were installed as chair, co-chair and chief of staff of the organization following his endorsement. An aggressive overhaul ensued, with dozens of employees losing their jobs.

As part of the leadership restructuring, a new slate of deputies will focus on battleground states as well as relationships with state parties and grassroots organizations, the second Trump campaign adviser said. Gone are regional directors who oversaw broad areas of the country.

""Folks that are focused on the battleground states will have a very narrow focus,"" the adviser said. ""We will not have that sort of middle layer that has historically existed to oversee a large region.""

Mantalk: The milestones that matter in a man’s life,"I have always been a late bloomer. I come late. This is a great thing if you are in bed with a woman, but a terrible thing at the workplace. Anyway, I broke my voice in Form One, but thankfully that was cancelled out by me being a rather funny fellow, claiming I had Nigerian roots, and was descended from the Hausa tribe, with my great grandfather moving to Kenya in the early 1900s. I couldn’t prove I was, but, crucially, they couldn’t prove I wasn’t.

That’s not all. My moustache and goatee started growing in Form Two, and by then I knew girls liked their men, men. If you didn’t have a beard or showed no visible signs of growing one, they would practise what Jesus recommended, looking the other way. But because God cannot tempt you beyond what you can bear, I told them good beards are like good Hip Hop. They are underground. They laughed. Turns out, if you make a girl laugh, you are halfway into her heart (or bank account, right Effie?)

Read: Mantalk: Why men are not believed when they turn down sex offer

I remember the first time I saw a guy shave his beard in high school. His name was Mark but we used to call him MtuSaba, styled as ‘Mtu7’. He was not the sharpest tool as evidenced by the eventual grade Mr Kaimenyi handed him, but my God, he could rap.

He channelled all his inner seven personalities, and when he was on stage, it was like a demon let loose at a holy rite. Women wanted to be with him; men wanted to be him. Where was I? Oh, yes. Mtu7 came to school with Veet (remember Veet?) and he applied it and voila! Like magic, his stubble was gone. I was under his spell for the rest of that term. I spent most of the days with his other bearded fellows. Grown men. I think those men were hired by the school under the guise of ‘students’ to represent us in the National School Games. Some may have done a little time back in the day. Some definitely could—and would—kick your ass, should your ass be in need of kicking.

When I bought my first shaver, it had me in a chokehold. I believed this was the bridge between teenage and adulthood. And then I realised that pencil-thin moustache, looking like a broke Salvador Dalí is not what girls like, so I said no way Jose! and shaved it all. Nothing screams adult! more than the ability to safely take a sharp object to your face every day.

But then I went to campus and I had a growth spurt. After the silence of my adolescence, now it seemed that even the ghosts were shouting, demanding to be heard. It seemed like I grew overnight, suddenly I had more freedom than sense, and I was responsible for myself.

After class, I’d offer, being a gentleman and true to my Kakamega roots to sindikiza my girl friends (note the space between girl and friends, which marks the friend zone) back to their rooms. And then they would invite me in but I would tell them I come from a long line of Rastafarian Anglicans and besides, doesn’t the school law state that male students are not allowed in female hostels during the 10 to 10 curfew? The girls would look at me, and smile strangely. I am sorry Stephanie; I was young and naïve! Please call me!

Read: Mantalk: Men, quit complaining, it’s time to take personal responsibility

Campus passed by in a whiz, and I was thrown full-blown into adulting. I got my first proper paycheck after nodding furiously when I said I could work under extreme pressure—UNSUPERVISED. I celebrated it by tithing ten per cent. The rest of the money not even KRA can waterboard me to reveal what happened to it. With an up-and-at-'em attitude, I had an “anything goes” approach to life. But, boy I had fun. Fun was had. Broke, binge-drinking, and impressionable—the hallmarks of a life still under construction.

And then came the big one. I met a girl. And not just any girl. A girl with the whole world behind her—a behind that could lead to a Damascene conversion, one that deserves its own personality trait. But turns out nyash can get you to the table, but it won’t keep you at the table.

Ah, the promised land. When she dumped me in the middle of June (in that cold!), I almost went berserk. I promised to never love a woman again. I cursed women. I pledged chastity. I swore off romance. But what is life? A few months later I met another and another and another and by this time, my heart had cauterised enough that I could handle rejection. A milestone.

I have been thinking lately about milestones. How quickly “these days” turn to “those days”.

Read: Mantalk: Why do more women want to act like men?

Milestones that define your transitions from one stage to the next. Every major milestone a man achieves in his life starts with getting something all on his own. All things that some—well, most—men secretly yearn for and snigger over but understand are aesthetically, socially, intellectually, and tastefully indefensible: Fast cars. Women. Women in fast cars. Getting women in fast cars pregnant. Because when it comes to success, every man makes his way at his own pace.

Often we never sit to stop and look at that rearview mirror, and thank God, the universe, or whatever it is fills the void in your soul. We are focused on acquiring the next success object, going to the next shiny toy, and climbing the next rung of social stairs.

While these do create an illusion of success and growth, the one thing that matters most is, what milestones are you chasing to grow as a man of character. Do you still have the same tardiness? Distractions? Vices? I have often looked to Hunter S. Thompson in my manhood journey, to shine a light on my dark path. “A man has to BE something; he has to matter,” Hunter says. “But a man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance. But beware of looking for goals; look for a way of life. To let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life— the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.”

It’s not the only milestone, but it is the only one that matters most. Even if you are a late bloomer.

The secret to a happy union,"There is a clear unwritten script on this marriage story. This is how it goes, you graduate from college, get a decent job, buy household stuff, join a Sacco, take a loan then buy your first car.

And life starts on a good note...

Next are wedding plans. Your potential partner has a decent job like you and is ready to settle.

If you are a woman, you look for a decent man — solid and God-fearing. Equally, if you are a man, you want a quality woman.

But here is the interesting part. You make sure you ‘sanitise’ your image so that when the potential partner finds you, you are “squeaky clean”.

You stop your reckless nightlife of drinking and partying and turn into a faithful church person. Then the paths for this “good” man and “godly” woman meet and marriage happens.

That is how Kenyan men and women prepare for marriage.

And there is more...

The ruracio lost its cultural significance and what is left is a display of a facade and exploitation to milk as much money as possible from the groom’s side.

Extravagant wedding

The groom then feels exploited and in turn, treats his wife like one of his possessions. After all, he paid dearly for her.

You start life on that wrong foundation. Baby number one checks in after that extravagant wedding that left you so broke you will need a decade to recover.

By the time the third baby is checking in, you have lost yourselves in the script. You fight a lot, are disillusioned and have no shared values or purpose.

As a coping mechanism, one of you starts to have an affair — the man, simply because he can lead the Bible study and still get away with adultery. But society will judge an adulterous woman harshly.

Slowly, betrayal sets in and the marriage starts to collapse.

If you are Christians, divorce is not an option and you may not warm up to counselling. And that is how many marriages end because they started on a wrong footing.

The script left out the most important secret ingredient of a joyous marriage — friendship.

And my readers agree with this:

“You are supposed to marry your friend, someone you connect with and whose company you enjoy. Love grows from there,” Josiah K, a reader says.

Emotional connection

Friendship, he notes, is the glue that binds the bond of marriage.

“Friendship is what strengthens emotional connection and intimacy.”

After two decades of marriage, Josiah says he is more in love with his wife because they were first friends.

“We were friends, then fell in love. Our friendship has continued to grow over the years, which has strengthened our love.”

Grace Mueni dishes out a brutal truth.

“Stop jumping into sex before marriage as it closes the door to emotional connection and does not give you time to know the other person. Friendship is what makes a marriage worth it,” Grace says.

She gives an example of an elderly couple who are friends and have grown closer over the years.

They have gone through the rough patches of life together and still laugh about it. They immensely enjoy each other’s company.

Indeed, meeting someone, growing a beautiful friendship together through the highs and lows of life, is what will set a solid foundation for a marriage that will stand the test of time.

DTB raises dividend as profit grows to Sh6.8bn,"DTB Group raised its dividend payout to a record of Sh6 per share for the year ended December when its net profit grew 13.4 percent to Sh6.8 billion on higher interest and transaction-based income.

The company had paid a dividend of Sh5 per share for the prior year. The new dividend, amounting to a total payout of Sh1.6 billion, will be distributed on June 28 to shareholders who will be on record as of May 24.

The dividend represents a payout of 24.3 percent of the net income in the review period, rising from 23 percent in the prior year when the lender posted a net profit of Sh6 billion.

DTB had earlier announced that it would be making incremental dividend payouts comprising the distribution of a higher percentage of rising earnings.



The payout ratio has risen from 21.4 percent in 2021 when the dividend per share was Sh3 and the net income stood at Sh3.9 billion.

“Going forward, we will continue to progressively increase the dividend payout ratio, on the back of an improving performance by your bank as well as ensuring that there is an equitable balance between rewarding shareholders and conserving capital to fund the ambitious growth aspirations of the Group,” DTB said in its 2022 annual report.

DTB is among the listed lenders that raised their dividends to record levels in the latest full year earnings announcements, joining Standard Chartered Bank Kenya, Absa Bank Kenya, Stanbic Holdings and I&M Group and NCBA Group.

DTB’s profit growth in the year ended December was driven by higher income from transactions as well as lending to the government and ordinary customers.

Net interest income, for instance, rose 20.4 percent to Sh27.5 billion. Non-interest income including fees and commissions meanwhile increased 34.2 percent to Sh12.1 billion.

The jump in interest income came as the bank’s loan expanded 54.7 percent to Sh308.4 billion. DTB saw its interest income from government securities rise 29.1 percent to Sh24.1 billion despite reducing its investment in the assets to Sh120.1 billion from Sh133.1 billion.

This reflects the impact of rising interest rates on bonds and T-bills last year.

DTB grew its deposits to Sh486 billion from Sh387.5 billion, a move that contributed to its interest expenses jumping to Sh25.7 billion from Sh17.1 billion.

Banks have seen their cost of funds rise in line with the increase in interest rates, with the average deposit rate standing at 10.18 percent in January 2024 from a low of 7.47 percent in the same month last year.

DTB’s operating expenses surged 39.7 percent to Sh30.8 billion on increased loan loss provisions, staff costs and other items.

Its provision for bad debt went up by Sh3.1 billion to Sh10.3 billion as the stock of non-performing loans expanded by Sh11.4 billion to Sh43.6 billion.

Night and day at the Bamba Restaurant,"It was last Saturday. After an enjoyable concert performed by the Nairobi Orchestra at the Braeside School, Lut and I had been invited to attend the concert and afterward, have a late meal at the Bamba Restaurant on Amboseli Road in Lavington.

All four of us were in a good mood after the concert, so we were not at all put out by the happy chatter at the surrounding tables as we found our reserved seats.

That was our first impression of the place – busy and lively.

Open for only five months, the restaurant is clearly doing something very right. It was just as well that our friends had reserved a table; in the morning I had gone on the internet to see how the place had described itself, and I saw that it was fully booked for the evening.

The EatOut review calls the restaurant a ‘hidden gem’. It’s a cliché that makes sense.

It is difficult to find along Amboseli Road, because the only sign is the word ‘Bamba’, written small on a black gate.

If you haven’t been there yet, and if this review tempts you to go, the restaurant is almost opposite the Amboseli Road turn-off to Amboseli Lane.

The cuisine is Lebanese. For starters, we shared two of them: the fire-roasted mushrooms, served with tahini yoghurt, and then Rakakat: crispy fried pastry rolls, stuffed with feta and mozzarella cheese and shatta sauce – made of pounded chilies. The mushrooms were, as my sister used to say, ‘more-ish’.

Bamba’s clientele

For me, the ‘more’ was the Sokaf: marinated beef tenderloin cubes, served with tzatziki – a creamy cucumber sauce. Again, delicious.

It was too dark for a good photograph, so that was a good excuse to see Bamba in Sunday daylight and sample the lunch menu. I’m glad I did; I now have a more rounded story to tell.

The restaurant adjoins an old Lavington house; one half has walls and the other half is open, and both have a translucent cover.

The décor matches the cuisine. A huge mural on a wall at right angles to the long bar is of the Hamsa hand. Google tells me that it is a universal sign of protection, power, and strength that dates back to ancient Mesopotamia – situated roughly where Iraq is today.

It is known as the Hand of Fatima in Islam and the Hand of Miriam in Judaism, and it is believed to protect against the evil eye and all negative energies.

The mid-day Sunday clientele tended to be older, quieter and more mixed than that of the late Saturday evening.

There were small groups of expats, a few from the Middle East and a good number of Kenyan couples and families with young children.

For my lunch, I chose the Halloumi: grilled cubes of mozzarella-type cheese, served with fried cherry tomatoes, black olives and fresh herbs. It was hot, very tasty, and the halloumi was fried just right – firm and not stringy.

Reasonable prices

I was also able to enjoy a dessert that had been sold out the previous evening – the small Pineapple Puff doughnuts, stuffed with pineapple rum jam and served with the Middle-Eastern ashta cream.

Across the food and drinks menus, the prices are very reasonable.

There was time to have a chat with Francis Njuguna, the young restaurant manager.

I was impressed by the music that was playing, and he told me that they have live music sessions on Sundays and that Sunday it was Makadem, with his blend of Bengla and Ohangla music.

I had watched Francis at work; sometimes he was talking with the barman when he was mixing the popular cocktails; sometime he was carrying plates. He is a hands-on manager and he is a good talker.

I asked him about Bamba’s usual clientele.

""All sorts of people,"" he said. ""And that is how we want it.""

If you would like to join them, remember to book, and also remember that the restaurant is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. You can find out more on Instagram.

Here is how to improve your child’s emotional Intelligence,"Good emotional intelligence is one of the keys to success in life. Leading to more friends, better relationships and better careers, so it makes sense to help your children improve theirs.

But there’s a limit to what you can do, so don’t stress over it because a lot of it is their genes, and much of the rest comes from the way they interact with their buddies.

Think of the way your kids pick up the latest slang from their schoolmates! But there’s still a lot you can do, especially when they’re very small.

And it’s worth it, because it will help them to resolve conflict, manage their own feelings and cope with the emotions of others.

They’ll also understand the differences between them and their friends better, and develop greater resilience.

Children need structure in their lives, so a good starting point is having consistent rules around the house, high expectations for their behaviour, and family rules on politeness and chores.

Dealing with negative emotions

Be a good role model, because they pay far more attention to what you’re doing than what you say.

Show them your values in the way you live your life, like being honest and kind. Show them how to put things right when you or they make a mistake.

Help your children to notice their own emotions and to be able to talk about them, by discussing the emotions of the characters in books, movies and TV shows.

‘Why do you think she’s crying?’ ‘Why do you think he felt that way?’

That teaches them that others have the same kinds of feelings as they do, and helps them to build empathy.

Help them to deal with their negative emotions, like fear and frustration. And resist the urge to jump in anytime you see them struggling, because allowing them to learn from their difficulties will help them grow more confident, resilient and self-reliant.

Coach them by all means, but always taking over your child’s problem for them sends the message that they aren’t capable of doing it themselves.

Emotional and social skills

Modern society is becoming highly risk averse, and that’s resulted in children’s lives being hugely restricted. Think of all the adventures you had as a child, which our children are denied.

And that matters, because children who’ve never fallen are more likely to be afraid of heights as adults, for example.

So gradually let your children discover risks and dangers, and how to manage them for themselves.

It’s also important for kids to have plenty of unsupervised, unguided play, as this gives them the chance to practice emotional and social skills with their peers, without adult guidance. Like how to support a friend in need, or to negotiate a conflict.

Help them to develop the belief that they’re in control of their own lives. Help them to be more optimistic, and to believe in their own abilities.

One day, you’ll have the pleasure of seeing them going out on their own, as successful adults.

Trump says he would take 'appropriate action' over Prince Harry visa question,"Former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said if Prince Harry lied on his visa application about drug-taking Trump would seek to take ""appropriate action"" if he won November's presidential election, declining to rule out Harry leaving the United States.

Trump's comments to British right-leaning media outlet GB News came in an interview with presenter and frequent Harry critic Nigel Farage.

U.S. visa applicants are required to make a disclosure about any history of drug use, which can impact their application. Lying on an application can result in penalties including deportation.

Harry, who has lived in California since 2020, admitted to past illegal drug use in his memoir ""Spare,"" after which conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation sued the U.S. Homeland Security Department to access his immigration records. Earlier this month, a judge ruled in that case that the details pertaining to Harry's visa application should be handed over to court.

Farage, a long-time Trump ally, asked the Republican presidential candidate if Prince Harry should receive any ""special privileges"" if he lied in his application.

""No. We'll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they'll have to take appropriate action,"" Trump replied.

When asked if that might mean Harry ""not staying in America,"" the former president replied: ""Oh I don't know. You'll have to tell me. You just have to tell me. You would have thought they would have known this a long time ago.""

Since Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle left royal duties and moved to California, they have often railed at their treatment by Britain's royal family.

From an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021 to a Netflix documentary series and Harry's book, the couple have asserted that the royals and their aides failed to protect them from a hostile press and leaked negative stories about them.

The couple, who married in 2018, have rarely returned to Britain since their departure for the United States.

Road deaths: The buck stops with Murkomen,"In recent weeks, our country has been engulfed by a dark cloud of sorrow caused by an upsurge in road carnages that must get us all worried.

This year alone, the grim statistics on the number of fatalities, major and minor injuries that have caused a blot on many families are mind-blowing.

Motorcyclists, pedestrians, passengers, drivers and pedal cyclists have all been affected. It is always painfully regretful to see the sight of a person writhing in excruciating pain due to a disaster that was otherwise avoidable.

This week, a student and a teacher lost their precious lives hours after occupants of another school bus cheated death at the notorious Nithi bridge thanks to their driver’s quick thinking.

The buck stops with the Ministry of Transport, headed by Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen, and its agency, the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA). They must stop at nothing than taming the accident and assuring Kenyans of their safety on the roads because many accidents are, more often than not, as a result of human error.

First, they must rid our roads of unroadworthy vehicles. All vehicles must be fitted with safety belts, speed governors and occasionally serviced.

Secondly, drivers, especially those of school buses must be licensed and experienced. Drink-driving, speeding, dangerous overtaking, driving while using mobile gadgets, among other misbehaviour, must be frowned upon, violators of all traffic rules must be made to face the full force of the law expeditiously. Thirdly, the authority must also ensure roads are well maintained and labeled appropriately to guide motorists.

We must do everything possible to keep our roads safe to alleviate further suffering.

On Monday, 11 students perished following an accident in Maungu, Taita Taveta County, involving a Kenyatta University that was taking them to an academic trip in Mombasa. Witnesses said the bus collided with a trailer.

Experts reveal why some pawpaws are sweeter than others,"Last week, there was a heated debate in the newsroom about pawpaws. The pawpaw, also known as papaya in English and mpapai (the tree) and papai (the fruit) in Swahili, is considered one of Kenyan scientists' most important fruit plants. Its scientific name is Carica papaya.

The pawpaw originated in lowland areas of Central and South America. Still, over the years, it has been cultivated in most warm regions of the world.

Fresh fruits are essential sources of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre, crucial in food security and human nutrition.

Journalists at the Nation's Health Desk debated which pawpaw was the sweetest and most nutritious. They wanted to know which one to recommend to their readers.

Keywords: Food for thought: Eating healthy is costly, but there are cheap options

""Nipe ile tamu kabisaa"" is what you are likely to say to your 'Mama Mboga' when buying a fruit.

I asked an expert which pawpaw was the sweetest and most nutritious. After all, who doesn't love healthy sweet things?

Jackson Makori, a fruit vendor in Gachie, Kiambu County, has been selling fruit for 15 years. He says that, as far as he knows, the sweetest pawpaws are found in Meru and Kitui counties.

Dr Patrick Maundu, a Kenyan ethnobotanist who has dedicated his life to the  research of indigenous knowledge on African biodiversity in health and nutrition gave some pointers.

""Sweetness in fruit evolved for good reason which is to attract animals that can feed on it and therefore cause dispersal of seeds in the fruit,"" said Dr Maundu who has been with the National Museums of Kenya since 1989 and now heads the Kenya Resource Centre For Indigenous Knowledge (Kenrik).

""When you cut the pawpaw and find that it has no seed, that's most likely a male fruit. They are usually seedless and not sweet because sweetness will not serve any function,"" Dr Maundu said.

""Pawpaw trees exist in three forms: female, male, and self-pollinating or hermaphrodite, hence regarded as trioecious. Female plants require pollen from male or self-pollinating plants, but male plants are more effective at passing their pollen to female flowers,"" he says.

Read: 23 million people in sub-Saharan Africa unable to afford a healthy diet

""Self-pollinating plants tend to have the sweetest fruits because they don't rely on pollen from elsewhere and are, therefore, the most effective in propagating the species. Pollen is mainly brought by wind or insects.

The ethnobotanist explains that hermaphrodite plants have both female and male parts in the same flower, and the fruit tends to have a pear shape.

According to Dr Maundu, male pawpaw trees are easier to pick out from pawpaw plants than bisexual and female ones.

This is because their flowers are slender, with most having one long, pendulous stalk.

""They lack the female parts, or the pistil with stigma, except in a few cases of pistil-bearing flowers at the farthest flowers. Female pawpaw plants, on the other hand, have fewer but larger flowers that are borne singly or in small clusters,"" the expert notes, adding that their stalks are short, so they cluster next to the pawpaw plant.

Dr Maundu says his study of the plant has found that Kenyan farmers prefer the self-pollinating pawpaw, even if they don't know it.

This is not only because they are the sweetest but also because they are more productive in terms of yields, as every tree will produce fruit. ​

Dolphin tours and the beauty of Wasini Island,"The idyllic island of Wasini, which stretches about seven kilometres long and is located 76 kilometres south of Mombasa, is the final pearl in the tropical beach necklace.

With its faded white alleyways, a fishing vibe inspired by Swahili culture, and fat mottled trees, this tiny island feels like a distant relative of Lamu and Zanzibar.

It is perfect for any backpacker looking for a beachside hideaway. In other words, it has that sit-under-a-Mugumo-tree-and-do-nothing-all-day-vibe.

A coastline littered with pockets of white sand and the Kisite Marine National Park is just a few hundred meters away, with a crystal clear beach where dolphins come to show off.

The abundance of boats on the dock provides an extremely picturesque view – a photographer’s paradise.

In fact, the only things Wasini lacks is regular electricity, banana-pancake traveler cafes, and backpacker hostels.

Cars and bicycles are a handful, (count yourself lucky if you spot one), but it is all the better for it. The population here is about 3,000 people.

The sun scorching at 32 degrees should be a concern should you forget to pack sunscreen.

Must-see destination

It is here that I spent a few days on my recent voyage to the South Coast of Ukunda, having docked in Diani. The island offered much, both fun and history.

A story is told of the Wavumba people who arrived on Wasini in the 18th century having been forced onto the Island after being ousted by vicious, constant attacks from the Waode community of Dar es Salaam.

Under their leader, Diwan Ruga, Wavumba found a new home on Wasini Island.

Wasini Island is perfect for any backpacker looking for a beachside hideaway.

Wavumba traditions tell of the immense wealth Ruga amassed through business with Chinese merchants while on the Island. In fact, the name Wasini means ‘the Chinese people’.

Soon the Wavumba were joined on the island by Arabs hailing from Pemba and Zanzibar, and the Omanis landed on the island’s shores and set up a slave trade centre.

Today Wasini has grown into a must-see destination. I saw only a few local tourists who are aware of this gem that lies within our borders.

Every boat that cruised past or against ours ferried a huge number of foreigners, with only one or two Kenyans to be seen, who in most cases were water guards.

Jasmine Gardens Villas

To get to Wasini and access the Kisite Mpunguti Marine National Park, I had to pay Sh4,000 for this full-day voyage.

I stayed at the Jasmine Gardens Villas which boasts of well-manicured lawns and gardens that make you forget the heat strokes for a second.

Fitted with an outdoor private pool beautifully surrounded by a floral garden, the villa offered four bedrooms, three bathrooms and an attic (that sleeps four), spacious kitchen, living room, a backyard and ‘to die for’ Pagoda with three swing chairs that can seat seven.

We were just two in the villa, which can comfortably house between eight to 15 people. There is also a concierge service at your disposal.

From the Gardens it’s only nine minutes to Ukunda airport and six to the Diani beach ranked 22nd in the world by TripAdvisor and third in Africa.

It’s from here that I was picked by the transfer agent at 7am and driven for 45 minutes to Shimoni Jetty.

It would be clever of you to bring your own water to evade the exploitation of the local traders who will mercilessly charge you Sh500 for a one litre bottle of water.

Incredible Island

At Shimoni you will board an Arabic dhow, and spend an hour enjoying the breeze and oceanic views as you sail to Kisite Mpunguti, a perfect spot for snorkelling and scuba dives.

If you are lucky you will swim with the dolphins but for this day luck wasn’t on our side. Those who were lucky from previous trips, narrated how pods of dolphins escorted their Dhow.

However, for the thrill, we took a deep dive into the Island’s surrounding ocean capturing memories of the colour-rich and lively coral reef.

I couldn’t help but marvel at the schools of fish and green sea turtles swimming rhythmically.

I can attest the island is truly a diver’s bliss, the salty water isn’t too cold hence one can enjoy themselves for a fairly long time like we did until the salty waters became a nuisance.

Sailing back from Kisite we had to pass through two more islands, Mpunguti Chini and Mpunguti Juu. There are no inhabitants at Mpunguti Chini while only three people live on Mpunguti Juu. The three are rangers from Kenya Wildlife service protecting the Marine Park.

Whether you prefer to call it Lamu’s little sister, the jewel of the Indian Ocean or the Home of Dolphins, Wasini is an incredible Kenyan Island.

Step up war on drugs and illicit liquors,"It is saddening to see people lose their lives from drugs and illicit liquor. According to the “2022 Report on the Status of Drugs and Substance Use” by the National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada) one in every 20 persons aged between 15 and 65 years were addicts.

That is why I support the government’s drive against drug and alcohol abuse spearheaded by the Interior ministry. An effective campaign will ensure that people become responsible. I fully agree with the Interior cabinet secretary, Prof Kithure Kindiki, to seize vehicles used to transport drugs and illicit liquor and houses in which they are manufactured, stored or sold and deem them as government property.

That will help in reducing the rate of road crashes and crime in the country, which are caused by drugs and illicit liquor. The government should also ensure more job opportunities are created to ensure every Kenyan is involved in constructive work that earns them an income.

That will also reduce idleness among the youth, which is the main cause of drug and alcohol abuse. It will also ensure that parents get time to raise their children responsibly. The government should also carry out campaigns to educate people about the adverse effects of drugs and liquor.

All should be aware of the consequences of a conviction for drug and illicit liquor abuse and trafficking. The courts should heavily punish those arrested for drug- and alcohol-related crimes to ensure that every citizen follows the law.

County commissioners and their deputies, as well as the chiefs, should be at the forefront to ensure the government strategies to fight drug and alcohol abuse and trafficking work successfully without fear or favour.

Citizens should collaborate fully with the government in this fight as they know where these drugs and alcohol are made and sold, whether in the towns or villages.

A reflection on street food culture in Kenya,"Last Saturday, I went to the second edition of the Nairobi Street Food Festival, organised by Little Africa Events and set up in the main arena of the ASK showground in Jamhuri.

I was rather disappointed; it wasn’t quite what I had expected.

I have some fond memories of street food. The most romantic, I suppose, was eating fish at informal stalls on the bank of the mighty Mekong River as it flowed past Vientiane, the capital city of Laos.

I was lucky to be there during Lai Heua Fai, the Festival of Light Boats. People make small boats of banana leaves and flowers, light them up with candles and float them on the river as darkness falls.

It is a way of paying homage to the spirit of the Mekong River, a provider of livelihoods for so many people.

Nearer home and without spiritual connotations, I enjoyed eating chicken on the roadside on the edge of Kabalagala, the place of nightspots in Kampala.

I was on a consultancy assignment and the team was staying at the Diplomate Hotel on Tank Hill, overlooking Kabalagala and the wider city.

Nairobi's street food scene

After a day’s work at the Ministry of Water, a few of us sometimes had our evening meal of chicken cooked on the roadside braziers.

We had beers brought out from the Telex Hotel just behind us. It was run by a formidable lady, and it got its name because it was known, during the years of conflict, as one of the best places in town for finding out what was really going on.

I have never enjoyed such riverside or roadside times in Nairobi. So I talked with a friend of ours – let’s call her Shiku – who knows about the street food scene here because, when she was between jobs, she was part of it.

“Nairobi has a very different street food culture from Kampala,” she said.

“There isn’t the social ambience you talk of. It’s about providing cheap food for city workers who don’t have much money. It’s a matter of providing something people can eat as they go about their daily hustles. It is being sold in kiosks or from carts, particularly at matatu and bus stations.”

I told Shiku that I was familiar with the maize cobs and sugarcane that I have seen being eaten all over the city.

I am familiar with such snacks as mandazis, samosas and chapattis, but I asked Shiku to give me some other examples. She gave me a number. Three, in particular, I remember: mayai gonga, smokie pasua and viazi karai.

Limited range of food

I now understand that mayai gonga is a hard-boiled egg, shelled, cut in half and filled with “kachumbari” or a sauce.

I have learnt that a “smokie pasua” is a ready-to-eat smoked sausage made of pork, beef, chicken or a blend of all these, split in half and filled with “kachumbari”. It is the cheapest sausage sold by Farmers Choice and it is usually sold from carts provided by them.

And I now know that “viazi karai” is made of boiled potatoes, coated in a batter and deep-fried, usually served with a chutney on the side, and available mainly in Mombasa.

At the Nairobi Street Food Festival last Saturday, apart from food and drink, there were stalls selling a variety of things, ranging from ladies’ underwear, jewellery and bags, to electric bikes.

The range of food was quite limited – nyama choma, hot dogs, samosas, pies, cakes and candy floss. I was there at midday when there was still setting up going on and the crowd was quite sparse.

However, people were still arriving two hours later when I was leaving – mainly small groups of young people. There was a DJ playing so, perhaps, the place would become more alive in the evening.

I had a chocolate ice-cream – a universal street food. Is there any country in the world where you can’t buy an ice-cream in the streets?

"Involve church, teachers in war on alcohol","The government’s efforts to curb alcohol consumption are bound to fail if other stakeholders such as religious organisations and teachers are not involved.

The government should also declare the menace a national disaster and make alcohol and drug abuse education a compulsory subject in the school curriculum.

Religious and faith-based leaders command a lot of respect in the communities and millions of people trust them because they stand for moral order, integrity, support groups and social bonding.

For a vice that is deeply entrenched in the country, harsh measures and laws cannot be used as a means to curb it and consumers are likely to become more defiant and resistant.

Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua needs to shift the focus from punishment to prevention and treatment if he wants to curb the spread of alcohol consumption.

Why can’t government officials ask themselves why, despite heavy taxes on alcohol and its by-products, the number of people consuming alcohol increases every financial year?

We must first agree that alcohol and drug abuse are a social, economic, spiritual, mental and general health problem before planning to tackle them.

Religious leaders are central pillars in promoting the fundamentals that provide a solid foundation on which to deal with alcohol and drug abuse in society.

Young people, who are also victims of this system, can be nourished spiritually and mentally through religion and faith-based support groups.

Personally, I was an alcoholic for about twenty years and a cigarette smoker for the same period, but I quit both through involvement in religious activities and gaining positive-thinking friends.

The National Authority for Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada) should take the initiative to make good policies and start and regulate programmes that can involve religious leaders and teachers in this fight against alcohol.

By declaring it a national disaster, the government and stakeholders can seek international funds to manage the programmes to fight the menace.

Inclusion in the school curriculum will ensure that children learn at an early age that vice can destroy health, economy, social bonds and even family and marital status.

Otherwise, the line the government has taken is likely to make the drinkers more defiant and resistant, as the majority are addicted and it’s compounded by rampant unemployment.

I am willing to share my experience with Nacada if invited.

Special centres can also be set up by the government to rehabilitate and teach skills to those who are serious alcoholics.

Where Gen Zs are investing their money,"Gen Zs are bucking the stereotype of footloose youth partying and recklessly spending to prove themselves a generation of astute investors boldly venturing into new territories. The 20-somethings have learned fast how to invest in shares and bonds at a younger age than their parents did.

While the older generation has traditionally favoured investments such as real estate, bonds, and stocks, GenZs are boldly charting the new waters of cryptocurrency, forex trading and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Others say they have taken up gambling as a form of investment.

Belinda Kiplimo, an independent financial adviser in Nairobi, says Gen Zs are keen on forex trading and cryptocurrencies.

“The investment patterns I’ve seen are an increased acceptance of money market funds (MMFs). In the past year, bond conversations have been on the rise in this demography and other channels include cryptos and forex trading,” she says.

Kendie Malowa, in her 20s, for instance, says if she got a genuine forex trader who is willing to teach her, she is willing to get into it as a form of investment. Forex trading in Kenya has been associated with scammers, making Gen Z weigh their options.

Financial experts say the younger generation, some of whom have recently hit the job market leaving employers rethinking organisational culture and work schedules, are looking to save and invest for the future in the age of rising inflation and high cost of living.

They came into the job market when the economy was sluggish and most are unemployed and self-employed, or in the gig economy, which is seasonal, hence the need to invest.

These Kenyans, aged between 18 and 27, are redefining their relationship with money, or rather, what is perceived to be their views on wealth, to engage in investing and retirement planning.

Jules Njeri, a 25-year-old freelance producer, who co-owns a photography studio with a friend, says when she gets money, she first spends it on bills and then does “a bit of investing here and there.”

She says she mainly saves in a fixed account and puts most of her investments in the photo studio business.

Being part of the risk-tolerant Gen Zs, she is keen on trying out different investing channels away from the common ones, such as homes and land. When I started working, I went to the bank and asked them for a way to save and I opened a fixed account. I put some savings in the bank, and the rest I invest in buying more equipment [for her photo studio],” she says.

Besides ploughing her money back into her studio by upgrading cameras, light rings and editing software, among other equipment that grows her business, she also invests in start-ups.

Bailout strategy

“Let’s say a friend has a business and it’s struggling, I will help them out by investing my money there, and when it gets back on its feet, they start paying me back or I buy shares in their business,” she says.

So far, she has invested in three of her friends’ businesses and has shares in them.

Jules’s bailout strategy is to invest a certain amount in struggling business A, and when it’s back to profitability, she gets her money back, or if the business is really good, she buys shares in it and is paid some ‘dividend’ after all expenses are deducted.

Kendie Malowa is another Gen Z whose interest in investing was recently piqued after her employment.

After graduating from the university, she started a sewing business with their cousin, but later on, she landed a formal job as a writer.

“I’m currently investing my money in a money market fund (MMF), a Sacco, and in bank savings,” says Ms Malowa.

“I don’t touch my MMF or sacco, I spend my savings from the bank or M-Pesa and Mshwari often.”

Sacco savings

Ms Malowa explains that she started investing just recently because she needed to get her affairs in order, such as renting a house and buying household items, among others.

Alice Wanjala, a 23-year-old, who works as a materials planner, overseeing inventory acquisition and supply management for companies, says she spends her money on household items such as furniture and kitchen appliances.

“Away from my pet peeve of buying clothes, I have sacco savings, money in MMF, and a fixed deposit account in the bank,” she says.

“I got into investing by partially teaching myself and by word-of-mouth from friends and social media.”

When asked why investing is important to her, she says: “I see investing as a form of delayed gratification. There’s so much to learn from investment, and it allows me to multiply what I already have.”

“Generally, I invest 40 percent, because 60 percent is enough to cover my bills and anything else I need in the house. I also get money from my hobby, which is braiding hair.”

Finfluencers appeal

This generation is also more open about talking about money than millennials, Gen X, and baby boomers.

TikTok has become one of the most popular sources for financial tips and advice, particularly among Gen Zs.

With various trends such as girl math, loud budgeting, and cash stuffing, financial advice is increasingly born on TikTok and spreading fast.

#Fintok is the hashtag young people are using to get financial tips and know what others are buying, selling, spending money on or investing in.

The community has garnered more than five billion views on the platform, highlighting a need for financial literacy about making money among this generation.

Being the first digital natives, Gen Z is also more comfortable investing via apps and buying things online than other generations.

This has given rise to “finfluencers” on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram ready to show them the three easy steps to make hundreds or even thousands of shillings.

GenZ is also using the platform to learn business ideas and how to make money to attain their ‘soft life’.

Finfluencers appeal to Gen Z investors because they produce engaging content that is instantly accessible and, even better, free.

“They seem keen to find out expert opinion on investing more, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, this is when I noticed the trend rise,” said Ms Kiplimo.

“Gen Z also tend to tell each other about their investment and about the advisers they meet more than the older generation who are more discreet about money and finances.”

"After Trump meet, Musk says he won't donate to either US presidential candidate","Billionaire Elon Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla TSLA.O, said on Wednesday that he will not donate money to either Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Democratic President Joe Biden in this year's election, one day after meeting Trump in Florida.

Trump met with Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, with a small group of other people in Florida over the weekend, a source confirmed to Reuters, as the former president seeks a major cash infusion for his campaign.

In a post on his social media platform X, Musk said: ""Just to be super clear, I am not donating money to either candidate for US President.""

In 2022, Musk asked Americans to elect a Republican Congress in U.S. midterm elections in order to counterbalance Biden's Democrats.

He has said on X that Biden is encouraging migrants to come to the United States so they can vote for Democrats, even though people without U.S. citizenship are not eligible to vote in federal elections.

Earlier on Wednesday, Nikki Haley ended her long-shot challenge to Trump, ensuring he will be the Republican Party's candidate in a rematch with Biden in November.

"Biden, Trump woo Haley voters, 2024 election's new prize","Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump are scrambling to win over supporters of Nikki Haley, a constituency that could be crucial to sending either man back to the White House.

Haley dropped out of the Republican presidential nomination contest on Wednesday but did not endorse Trump and said it was now up to him to ""earn"" the support of voters who did not initially back him.

Almost 570,000 voters in three key battleground states - Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan - voted for Haley in the Republican nominating contest, a small but potentially significant group in races that have been decided by tiny margins in recent elections.

Haley won 250,000 votes in North Carolina's primary, for example, a state that Trump won by less than 75,000 votes in 2020.

Both Biden and Trump quickly put out statements on Wednesday calling on Haley voters to join their team - although they used vastly different tactics.

Biden commended Haley on ""speaking the truth"" about Trump, while Trump said he had ""trounced"" her in the Super Tuesday Republican contest.

""Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,"" Biden said in a statement.

In his Truth Social post, Trump added that he ""would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation,"" and described Biden as an enemy who is destroying the country.

Trump has derided Haley throughout the campaign - including using sexist and racist language. And many of her voters have wondered if they still have a place in the Republican Party, which has coalesced around Trump, despite his repeated lies about having won the 2020 election against Biden, and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Still, some experts say there's little precedent for Republicans like Haley's supporters to automatically come out for a Democrat in a general election.

""The next several months are going to be about the two candidates trying to convince people to come home to their regular party,"" said Hans Noel, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University.

""Right now, the numbers are really high for Haley voters to say 'I would never vote for Trump.' But almost certainly most of them will come around and either vote for Trump or they might not vote at all,"" he said, citing historical precedent.

Political strategists believe a significant number of Haley voters were Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents who crossed over to vote in Republican primary contests, to try to deliver a blow to Trump.

Still, a bevy of anti-Trump groups will be working hard to convince Haley voters to get behind Biden.

Reed Galen, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a prominent anti-Trump group of current and former Republicans, said Haley had shown that there are up to 30% of Republican voters who do not like Trump, a figure that would represent about 11 million registered Republicans nationwide.

Galen said his group will target them between now and November's general election, aiming $50 million at an anti-Trump, pro-Biden persuasion campaign focused on battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.

The digital and TV ad campaign will focus on abortion rights, the blow to U.S. prestige abroad under Trump, and his failure to fully support Ukraine in its war against Russia.

PrimaryPivot, another pro-Haley group, changed its name to Haley Voters for Biden just after Haley dropped out of the race.

Co-founder Robert Schwartz said the group will target the roughly 500,000 voters who backed Haley in the primary campaign in Michigan and North Carolina, as well as possible Haley voters in Georgia, which holds its primary March 12.

Republican strategist Ford O'Connell, who worked with Trump during the 2020 campaign, said he expected Trump to extend an ""olive branch"" to Haley supporters but that many were not persuadable.

O'Connell noted that Trump did not go after Haley in his speech on Tuesday night. Trump showed that he ""understood that the way to victory is to stay on the issues: the border, prices, foreign policy,"" O'Connell said.

"Nikki Haley to end White House bid, clearing path for a Trump-Biden rematch","Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.

Haley will give a speech at 10am local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time.

She will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added.

Haley's decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests.

Haley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the party's base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments.

The rematch between Trump, 77, and Biden, 81 - the first repeat U.S. presidential contest since 1956 - is one that few Americans want. Opinion polls show both Biden and Trump have low approval ratings among voters.

The election promises to be deeply divisive in a country already riven by political polarisation. Biden has cast Trump as an existential danger to democratic principles, while Trump has sought to re-litigate his false claims that he won in 2020.

Haley, 52, had drawn support from deep-pocketed donors intent on stopping Trump from winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, particularly after she notched a series of strong performances at debates that Trump opted to skip.

She ultimately failed to pry loose enough conservative voters in the face of Trump's dominance.

But her stronger showing among moderate Republicans and independents - she won unaffiliated voters by a wide margin in New Hampshire and notched almost 40 per cent of the vote in South Carolina - highlighted how Trump's scorched-earth style of politics could make him vulnerable in the Nov. 5 election.

On March 3, she won the Washington, D.C., Republican primary with 62.9% of the vote, versus 33.2 per cent for Trump. On Tuesday, her only win came in Vermont, a small, deeply Democratic state.

Biden has his own baggage, including widespread concern about his age. Three-quarters of respondents in a February Reuters/Ipsos poll said he was too old to work in government, after already serving as the oldest U.S. president in history.

About half of respondents said the same about Trump.

Key issues

As in 2020, the race is likely to come down to a handful of swing states, thanks to the winner-take-all, state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the presidential election. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all expected to be closely contested in November.

The central issues of the campaign have already come into focus. Despite low unemployment, a red-hot stock market and easing inflation, voters have voiced dissatisfaction with Biden's economic performance.

Biden's other major weakness is the state of the U.S.-Mexico border, where a surge of migrants overwhelmed the system after Biden eased some Trump-era policies. Trump's hawkish stance on immigration - including a promise to initiate the largest deportation effort in history - is at the core of his campaign, just as it was in 2016.

Voters expect Trump would do a better job on both the economy and immigration, according to opinion polls.

Republican lawmakers, egged on by Trump, rejected a bipartisan immigration enforcement bill in February, giving Biden an opportunity to argue that Republicans are more interested in preserving the southern border as a problem rather than finding a solution.

Democrats are also optimistic that voter sentiment on the economy will shift in Biden's favour if economic trends go on rising throughout 2024.

Trump may be dogged by his myriad criminal charges throughout the year, though the schedule of his trials remains unclear. The federal case charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 election, perhaps the weightiest he faces, has been paused while Trump pursues a long-shot argument that he is immune from prosecution.

While most Republicans view his indictments as politically motivated, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, about a quarter of Republicans and half of independents say they won't support him if he is convicted of a crime before the election.

Biden has argued that Trump poses a threat to democracy, citing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to reverse Biden's 2020 victory.

Abortion, too, will play a crucial role after the nine-member U.S. Supreme Court, buoyed by three Trump appointees, eliminated a nationwide right to terminate pregnancies in 2022. The subject has become a political liability for Republicans, helping Democrats over-perform expectations in the 2022 midterm elections.

Abortion rights advocates have launched efforts to put the issue before voters in several states, including the battleground of Arizona.

Haley thwarted

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, had been among the first Republican contenders to enter the race in February 2023, but she was largely an afterthought until garnering attention for her standout debate performances later in the year.

She put her foreign policy expertise at the centre of her campaign, adopting hawkish stances toward China and Russia and forcefully advocating for continued aid to Ukraine, a stance that put her at odds with the more isolationist Trump.

But she was reluctant to completely disavow her former boss - she served as Trump's U.N. ambassador - despite his four indictments and two impeachments. Trump showed no such reticence, frequently insulting her intelligence and Indian heritage.

Only in the last months of her campaign did Haley begin to forcefully hit back at Trump, questioning his mental acuity, calling him a liar and saying he was too afraid to debate her.

In the final weeks of the campaign, she became the standard-bearer for the anti-Trump wing of the party, a dramatic evolution for someone who just months earlier praised the former president in her stump speeches.

Still, she said she would pardon Trump if he were convicted in any of the criminal cases he faces, a position she has never abandoned.

UNEA-6 resolutions: The key points and implications,"After a week of negotiations at the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), delegates left with resolutions and decisions to guide countries on critical environmental issues. This year, there were 19 resolutions under consideration, but only 15 made it to the final document passed during the Assembly. Two decisions and a ministerial declaration were also passed. Here is a breakdown of each resolution and its implications for countries worldwide.

Environmental aspects of minerals and metals

Negotiations for this resolution started in 2019 at UNEA-4, where the main discussion was mineral resource governance. Progress was shared at UNEA-5, and this year, countries agreed on the new aspects of the resolution.

The final draft decision now encourages countries to develop regulations to promote sustainable consumption and production of metals and minerals. They must ensure a complete cycle for mineral management as guided in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agenda aims to reduce any arising negative impacts of minerals and metals on the environment, society and economy.

Circularity of a resilient, low-carbon sugar cane agro-industry

This resolution was tabled in 2019 but concluded this year. With the knowledge that sugarcane is farmed in some 80 countries worldwide, including Kenya, negotiators acknowledged that climate change will grossly affect the industry. During the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (COP28) in Dubai last year, countries launched the International Alliance for the Circularity of a Resilient and Low-carbon Sugar Cane agro-industry. This helped propel this resolution to fruition this year.

Amendments to the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured Global Environment Facility

This resolution will ensure that the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) headquartered in Nairobi, will have a stronger mandate in implementing environmental policies under the Global Environment Facility. The facility will ensure inclusivity, transparency, accountability and responsiveness for the projects and programmes under it by ensuring eligibility for] financing global projects is followed to the letter.

Enhancing the role and viability of regional forums of environment ministers and Unep regional offices in achieving multilateral cooperation in tackling environmental challenges

Its objective is to encourage discussion and collaboration among nations to address environmental challenges within their territories. The outcome of this effort will be reviewed during the next UNEA in 2026, where a stocktake will be conducted to assess how countries have incorporated regional forums and environmental authorities in their efforts.

Promoting synergies, cooperation or collaboration for national implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and other relevant environmental instruments

A recently released report, Global Resources Outlook 2024 during the UNEA-6 event showed that humans are using up available resources at an unsustainable rate. It highlights the need for equitable resource-sharing among individuals and nations. To achieve this, countries must improve their knowledge and understanding of the potential benefits of collaboration. This can be accomplished by intensifying efforts to gather and share best practices and promoting information exchange.

Foster national action to address global environmental challenges through increased cooperation between the UNEA, the Unep and multilateral environmental agreements.

After a resolution has been passed by the UNEA, the responsibility of implementing the decisions usually falls on individual countries. While some countries may act promptly, others may take longer to implement the decisions. This resolution encourages all countries to act swiftly and efficiently when complying with multilateral environmental agreements.

Combating sand and dust storms

During the closing plenary, UNEA-6 Leila Benali stated that sand and dust storms were deadly phenomena that often go unnoticed. Therefore, it is crucial to bring awareness to this issue. Sand and dust storms have been increasing globally, with approximately two billion tons of sand and dust entering the atmosphere each year, according to a report by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The resolution highlights Africa and Asia as the most affected regions, particularly in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-regions. The resolution proposes coordinated action to address this challenge and potentially reduce its impact.

Promoting sustainable lifestyles

This resolution demands that countries implement it at the community level, which requires a change in current standards of living. It must be included in the existing program known as the One Planet Network Programme on Sustainable Lifestyles and Education. Unep will need to provide resources to countries, especially for the educational skills necessary to make this shift.

Sound management of chemicals and waste

Many countries have been raising concerns about the issue of pollution, which has been causing negative impacts on people's health. Despite being an existing problem, it has been largely ignored. To address this, a resolution was passed by the World Health Assembly last year, which calls for a discussion during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to promote a Global Framework on Chemicals. This resolution aims to manage and tackle pollution more effectively.

Promote regional cooperation on air pollution to improve air quality globally

There are regulations to address air pollution, but there is still a need to enhance air quality further. The latest resolution acknowledges that air pollution not only affects individuals but also leads to the loss of biodiversity. The Assembly recognises that addressing air pollution would result in numerous benefits. Additionally, taking care of air quality could positively impact climate change.

Manage highly hazardous pesticides

This resolution supports the one passed by the previous UN General Assembly and the one from last year’s World Health Assembly. It highlights the dangers of leaving highly hazardous pesticides unmanaged, which can put people at risk of harm. Therefore, countries are urged to take intentional steps to reduce associated risks. They are also encouraged to conduct studies that can help minimise damage from such pesticides or find alternative and less harmful sources.

Environmental assistance and recovery in areas affected by armed conflict

Despite the triple planetary crisis that the world is facing, other crises, such as war, continue to disrupt everyday life. In areas affected by armed conflict, people tend to focus solely on the war and overlook other underlying issues, such as the environment. This resolution aims to address this by promoting a comprehensive and sustainable approach to managing the challenges faced by conflict-affected regions.

Strengthening ocean efforts to tackle climate change, marine biodiversity loss and pollution

There is a growing concern about the health of oceans around the world. Studies conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have revealed that climate change significantly impacts the ocean and that the situation may worsen as temperatures continue to rise. To address this issue, several agreements and strategies have been put forward, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships.

Effective and inclusive solutions for strengthening water policies to achieve sustainable development in the context of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.

Water is a resource that has often caused conflicts between different countries and communities, as it transcends boundaries, and no single entity can claim ownership of it. Despite this, the world must continue to work towards achieving sustainable development goals related to water. During a recent meeting, delegates expressed concern about the dwindling quantity and quality of water resources worldwide. They encouraged countries to dialogue about collaborating on water-related issues, including local and indigenous knowledge. The progress made on this critical issue will be discussed at the next Assembly.

Strengthening international efforts to combat desertification and land degradation, restore degraded land, promote land conservation and sustainable land management, contribute to land degradation neutrality and enhance drought resilience

Climate change has led to an increase in desertification. However, land degradation is mainly caused by changes in land use. Notably, a large portion of the earth's land is arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid. Restoring these lands can help create a more sustainable economy for those who rely on them. This approach integrates various factors and promotes a holistic approach to land management.

Prioritise content that develops the youth,"Publishing houses should put more effort into producing content that prioritises the personal development of the youth.

They have a unique opportunity and responsibility to contribute to that novel deed by disseminating content that is not only informative but also empowering.

From those who offer practical advice on career planning and financial literacy to those who delve into mental health awareness and self-care practices, there is a vast landscape of topics that can positively impact the lives of young readers.

The significance of publishing such content cannot be gainsaid. It serves to offer a beacon of hope for those struggling with self-doubt or uncertainty about their future.

While providing insights and perspectives from experts and peers, it reassures them they are not alone in their journey to personal growth and fulfilment.

Furthermore, publishing content geared towards the personal development of the youth fosters a sense of community and belonging. It creates a platform for dialogue and exchange of ideas, allowing young individuals to connect with others who share their aspirations and challenges.

Investing in the personal development of the youth yields long-term benefits for society. Empowered and resilient young individuals are better equipped to overcome obstacles, pursue their passion and contribute meaningfully to their communities.

By so nurturing their talents and ambitions, the editors, and publishers, lay the foundation for a brighter and more prosperous future for generations to come.

I encourage the editors and publishers to seize the opportunity of being in their hallowed positions to inspire, educate and uplift the next generation, empowering them to realise their full potential and make a positive impact on the world.

Together, we can cultivate a culture of growth, resilience and hope that will shape the leaders and change-makers of tomorrow.

A visit to the new-look Nairobi Giraffe Centre,"A friend asked if we had been to Nairobi’s Giraffe Centre since its renovation. ‘If not, you will be surprised,’ he said. We hadn’t been there for years; so we went – and we were surprised.

We had been there many times when our two boys were young, and a close-up of Jan gingerly placing a food pellet on the tongue of one of the giraffes, has made it into our family album.

When young, Jan used to be fond of jokes. One of them I remember was:

‘Dad, why is a giraffe’s neck so long?’

‘So he can browse leaves from the top of trees?’

‘No. It’s because his feet smell so bad.’

It was last Sunday that Lut and I followed our friend’s advice. We went well before coffee time, because we were anticipating the Centre would be busy. It already was.

The first surprise was the high-tech entrance – the cashless payment generated a code on our phone, which we could then show to the gatekeeper. And the access to the viewing platform is now via a smart elevated and wheelchair-friendly walkway.

The second surprise was that the charges were displayed as Sh1,500 for non-residents and Sh400 for residents. ‘What about citizens?’ we asked.

‘The same as residents,’ came the answer. We wondered if this meant that the Centre was not really targeting Kenyans – especially when we could see only one little girl with her dad among the visitors on the viewing and feeding platform.

However, when we were later having a chat with David Mutua, who we had just heard making a presentation in the Education Centre, he told us that we had a wrong impression.

‘Stay here till noon,’ he said. ‘You will see plenty of Kenyan families. It’s Sunday, remember. Many Kenyans will be at church, and the others don’t get up early on a Sunday.’

It was an interesting conversation with David. He talked about how he had killed many birds with a catapult when he was a child – like many other children in Machakos where he grew up.

But, later, he became very interested in wildlife and conservation. He said that these days, when he goes back to Machakos, he tries to convince boys to put away their catapults.

Now, David is in a happy place, because he is working for an organisation, the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, that is committed to raising the awareness of Kenyan children about the importance of wildlife conservation.

Apart from the opportunity to get close to giraffes (though not close enough to test Jan’s theory about their smelly feet) there is an excellent Education Centre that, with its films, talks, puzzles and competitions, is providing a lot of fun, as well as giving out a lot of information – particularly about the endangered sub-species Rothschild giraffes that are the key actors at the Centre.

A lot of emphasis is given to catering for school visits as well as outreach educational activities.

Over its 40 years, the Centre has engaged with over 2 million children.

Apart from stretching their necks to be fed with small pellets at the viewing platform, the giraffes have many acres of a green sanctuary where they can stretch their long legs.

Also, scuttling across the barer ground close to the Centre, you are bound to see a family of tusked warthogs, with their skinny tails held high when they run.

After a cappuccino at the Centre’s café, we crossed the road and took to the nature trail, for which there is no extra charge. The full walk is 1.5 kilometres, along narrow paths through the indigenous forest.

The recorded number of bird species is 178, and the record sighting in one visit is 60. We saw very few but heard many. You might also see a few of the smaller mammals, such as dik dik, squirrels and, of course, warthogs.

Happiness is something you intentionally create,"Happiness isn’t some impossible dream. It’s something you can work on.

Because most people confuse happiness with success. We’re forever being told that money and possessions will make us happy.

But that’s not true, because material wants are never satisfied. Instead, you should focus on the things that truly make people happy. Such as living in tune with your values. And simple pleasures like quietly watching a beautiful sunset.

So choose a value that’s important to you. Kindness for example, or supporting your spouse, and ask yourself each week how you’ve improved it.

You’ll also feel happier if you minimise choices, simplify your life and create routines. So rather than agonising over what to cook, one meal at a time, plan your meals for the week and then shop for the ingredients.

And create a morning routine that starts your day efficiently. Create a film shortlist rather than forever scrolling through all the streaming menus. Build a go-to playlist for your favourite music.

You’ll be happier if you feel good about yourself. So write a list of things you like about yourself, for example, that you’re honest, or kind, or always there for your friends. If that’s hard, think of someone you look up to, and imagine what they would write about you.

Read: The values you hold say who you really are

Try to find a few tasks that fully absorb you. Even a short time each week doing something that involves complete concentration will increase your sense of control and self worth. Such as practising a tricky pool shot, speed-solving a Rubik’s Cube, following a complex new recipe, or planting out delicate seedlings.

Avoid seeing yourself as a victim. We all do it, such as when someone cuts in front of us in traffic. Instead, change the story to include the other person’s perspective. For example by imagining that the other driver was distracted, and it’s only your skill that prevented an accident.

Or the way people stockpile excessively when there are shortages. It’s easy to see them as villains and ourselves as their victims. Instead, imagine they’re looking after elderly parents and really need that stuff.

And what about those ‘wants’ that we’re sure will make us happy? That glass of whisky, an even bigger television, or a promotion at work?

Strangely, after you’ve got them, you only feel happier for a moment. Only to slip back to where you were before, and probably even less content in future.

Instead, focus on strengthening the aspects of your life that do lead to long term happiness. Such as choosing to feel at peace with the life you have. Stop second-guessing past decisions.

Plan your finances so that you feel confident about coping with unexpected events. Start truly living the life of the person you want to be.

Consciously, spend at least a few minutes every day thinking about each of these. Do that even a little, and you’ll be happier. Do it a lot, and your life will be transformed.

Who are the candidates running in 2024 US presidential election?,"Republican former President Donald Trump and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley are competing to be their party's presidential nominee for the 2024 general election, while President Joe Biden is effectively the Democratic Party's nominee. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.

Here is a list of the candidates.

DONALD TRUMP

Trump has leveraged his civil cases and indictments in four criminal cases - unprecedented for a former American president - to boost his popularity among Republicans and raise funds, helping to make him the Republican frontrunner with 64%, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. He scored victories in the early nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and is pushing to replace Republican National Committee leadership with his own top allies ahead of the party's July nominating convention.

Trump, 77, has called the indictments a political witch hunt to thwart his pursuit of a second four-year term, an assertion that the Justice Department has denied. Several legal challenges have reached the US Supreme Court regarding his eligibility for the ballot following the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol and whether he can claim presidential immunity. If elected again, Trump has vowed revenge against his perceived enemies and has adopted increasingly authoritarian language, including saying he would not be a dictator except ""on day one.""

He has promised other sweeping changes, including gutting the federal civil service to install loyalists and imposing tougher immigration policies such as mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship. He has also promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance, vowed harsher curbs on trade with China and suggested he would not defend NATO allies.

NIKKI HALEY

A former South Carolina governor and Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Haley, 52, has emphasized her relative youth compared to Biden, 81, and Trump, as well as her background as the daughter of Indian immigrants.

She had gained a reputation in the Republican Party as a solid conservative who could address issues of gender and race in a more credible fashion than many of her peers. But Trump has increasingly targeted her, lobbing racist attacks at her ethnicity and amplifying false claims about her eligibility for the White House despite her birth in South Carolina.

Haley, who drew 19% support among Republicans in the Reuters/Ipsos survey, has sharpened her attacks on Trump following New Hampshire's Jan. 23 contest and raised $1 million after Trump threatened her donors. She has also pitched herself as a stalwart defender of American interests abroad, citing Trump's praise of dictators, and ramped up her argument that Trump is too chaotic and divisive to be effective.

She has suggested she will stay in the race past the Feb. 24 primary in her home state, where opinion polls show she trails Trump, and her campaign has blasted Trump's proposed RNC changes, saying the political party should be overhauled and its finances audited.

DEMOCRATIC PARTY

JOE BIDEN

Biden, 81, already the oldest U.S. president ever, will have to convince voters he has the stamina for another four years in office, amid poor approval ratings and a special counsel report suggesting he suffered memory lapses. Biden has blasted the report, and his allies say he believes he is the only Democratic candidate who can defeat Trump and protect democracy. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll put Biden at 34%, while Trump garnered 37% — close to the 2.9 percentage-point margin of error.

In announcing his candidacy, Biden declared he needed to defend American liberties and pointed to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters. Vice President Kamala Harris is again his running mate.

The economy will also factor in his reelection campaign. While the US escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation hit 40-year highs in 2022 and the cost of essentials is weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost US  industrial output, but he has received little recognition from voters for the latter.

Biden has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to sanction Russia and support Kyiv, and he has been supportive of Israel in its conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian aid. However, he has faced sharp criticism from some fellow Democrats for not backing a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, where Gaza health officials say more than 28,400 people have been killed, thousands of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and residents have insufficient food, water and medical supplies.

Biden's handling of immigration policy has also been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border hit record highs during his administration.

In the Democratic Party's presidential nominating contests, Biden has easily won in New Hampshire,South Carolina and Nevada.

DEAN PHILLIPS

Dean Phillips, a little-known US congressman from Minnesota, announced in October he would mount a long-shot challenge to Biden because he does not believe the president can win another term.

The 55-year-old millionaire businessman and gelato company co-founder announced his bid in a one-minute video posted online, saying: ""We've got some challenges. ... We're going to repair this economy, and we are going to repair America.""

Phillips failed to win any delegates in South Carolina and took second place in New Hampshire. He did not appear on the Nevada ballot.

INDEPENDENTS

ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR

An anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination, but he is far behind in polling.

Some recent Reuters/Ipsos polls showed Kennedy could harm Biden more than Trump in the presidential election, where third-party candidates have affected the outcome of US elections even without winning. Trump's six-percentage point lead over Biden in Reuters/Ipsos polling held even when respondents had the option of voting for third-party candidates, including Kennedy, whose support stood at 8%.

Kennedy is the son of USSenator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid. A surprise Super Bowl ad heavily featuring his connection to his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, angered his family members and prompted him to apologize.

He was banned from Instagram for spreading misinformation about vaccines and the Covid-19 pandemic but was later reinstated. He also lost a legal bid to force YouTube owner Google to reinstate videos of him questioning the safety of Covid vaccines.

CORNEL WEST

The political activist, philosopher Cornel West.

The political activist, philosopher and academic said in June he would launch a third-party bid for president that is likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.

West, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate, but in October he said people ""want good policies over partisan politics"" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.

JILL STEIN

Jill Stein, a physician, re-upped her 2016 Green Party bid on November 9, accusing Democrats of betraying their promises ""for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don’t even make such promises in the first place.""

Stein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.

"Good sex is secret to Joe Biden's long marriage, new book says","Washington,

President Joe Biden has joked to aides that the key to a long and lasting marriage is ""good sex,"" according to a new book about first lady Jill Biden that casts a spotlight on their 47-year romance.

""American Woman - The Transformation of the Modern First Lady, from Hillary Clinton to Jill Biden,"" was authored by New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers and comes out this week.

The part about sex takes up only a few paragraphs in the 276-page book but has already generated headlines.

Rogers writes that Biden opted against running for president in 2004, a decision punctuated to aides when Jill Biden entered the room wearing a halter top with the word ""NO"" scrawled on her stomach.

Joe Biden, now 81, told a group of supporters that year that he had little interest in running for president. ""I'd rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep,"" he said.

The comment drew a shrug from a spokesperson at the time who said then-Senator Biden was ""frankly totally in love with his wife,"" Rogers writes.

""Joe may have tamped down on his public bedroom declarations (in) winning the presidency, but he has joked to aides that 'good sex' is the key to a lasting and happy marriage, much to his wife's chagrin,"" according to Rogers.

The book describes the anguish Joe Biden experienced when his first wife, Neilia, died in a 1972 car crash along with their daughter Naomi.

He and Jill married in 1977, but it took five proposals from Biden to get Jill to agree.

""I've been as patient as I know how to be, but this has got my Irish up. Either you decide to marry me or that's it - I'm out. I'm not asking again,"" Biden said on the fifth try, Rogers writes.

This is what adulting is all about…,"Children imagine that being an adult will be wonderful. As teens, they smugly think they know everything, and that their parents got it all wrong.

Adults know different of course, but no teenager ever gets it. What else don’t they know about adulting?

They don’t know how important it is to make good choices early on, in their education, career and relationships. And that empathy, resilience and motivation are critical skills.

They don’t realise how much their outgoings and responsibilities will be as an adult. Or that they’ll be constantly worrying about money.

They don’t realise how hard they will have to work. Or how easy it is to make friends when you’re young and how much more difficult it is as you grow older.

They don’t realise that life throws some really tough curveballs, and that they’ll have to deal with them on their own. Because no one really cares, and everyone has their own problems to solve.

They don’t know how important it is to look after their health. And that all the abuse they’re heaping on their bodies now will eventually catch up with them.

They can’t even begin to understand how destructive alcohol, casual sex and drugs can be.

They don’t realise how jealous people can be, so that even your best friend might become your worst enemy.

They don’t know that you’re always judged by your looks, no matter how talented or intelligent you are. That it’s not about what you’ve done, but what you’re doing now that matters. Or how fleeting most of our feelings are, so you need to take yourself much less seriously.

They don’t realise how much they have to learn. Or that everyone is the sum of all the choices they’ve made.

Teens have no idea how important it is to learn to deal well with conflict, disappointments, hardships and sorrows.

Or how destructive divorce is, so it’s critical to choose the right person to marry. That marrying someone just for their beauty or wealth is a really bad idea. And that relationships get better as you learn to appreciate the value of kindness and compassion.

They don’t realise how costly mistakes are, how quickly you have to learn from each one, and how repeating the same mistake again could ruin your life.

They don’t realise how slowly time goes by when you’re young, and how fast it goes as an adult. Until one day you realise that you’ve only a limited time left to live. They don’t realise that the money they’re blowing now could be really important in the future.

They don’t realise how many people are competing to impress people they don’t know with money they don’t have. And that life isn’t actually about who makes the most. It’s about who can find the most joy with the life they have.

Bottom line? Adulting is like losing your mother in the supermarket for the rest of your life.

Key dates in the 2024 US presidential race,"Former President Donald Trump is the frontrunner to be the Republican presidential nominee in the 2024 election, while President Joe Biden faces little opposition in the Democratic Party in his campaign for a second term.

Here is a timeline of events related to the November 5, 2024, election between now and Inauguration Day in January 2025.

2024

- February 24: South Carolina Republican primary

- February 27: Democrats and Republicans vote in the Michigan state-run primary, which was brought forward by the Democratic-controlled Midwestern state in a move opposed by Republicans. Republicans will instead choose the majority of their delegates during caucuses in March.

- March 2: Republicans in Michigan pick most of their delegates during party-run caucuses.

- March 5: Known as Super Tuesday, this is the biggest single day of primaries.

Both parties hold them in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.

Democrats in Utah will also vote in their primary while Republicans hold their caucuses in the state. Republicans in Alaska vote in their primary.

Iowa Democrats hold the final day of their mail-in caucuses and U.S. territory American Samoa has its caucuses on this date too.

- March 12: Primaries held in the states of Georgia, Mississippi and Washington. Republicans in Hawaii hold caucuses.

- March 19: Primaries held in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio.

- June 4: Primaries in the remaining states are held.

- July 15-18: Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party formally chooses its candidate.

- August 19-22: Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the party formally chooses its candidate.

- September 16: The date set by the Commission on Presidential Debates for the first presidential debate to take place. It is to be held at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.

- September 25: The date set for the only vice presidential debate, to be held at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.

- October 1: The date set for the second presidential debate, to be held at Virginia State University in Petersburg, Virginia.

- October 9: The date set for the third and final presidential debate, to be held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.

- November 5: Election Day

- Later in November: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is close and mail-in ballots are a factor.

2025

- January 6: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected.

Ahead of the count on January 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by rioters and some people chanted, ""hang Mike Pence"" as they tried to stop the count. Both chambers of Congress later resumed their work and certified Biden's win.

Congress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results – a much higher bar than existed before, when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.

- January 20: The inauguration of the election winner and their vice president takes place. At this ceremony, the victor is officially sworn in and takes office.

2023 Afcon top scorer Emilio Nsue suspended over gross misconduct,"The Equatoguinean Football Federation (FEGUIFUT) has indefinitely suspended the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations top scorer and captain Emilio Nsue Lopez and midfielder Iban Salvador for gross indiscipline at the just-ended tournament in Cote d’Ivoire.

In a release on Tuesday, the federation did not detail the acts of indiscipline by the players, but referred to a January 29 “unpleasant incident” by Ibdan in Abidjan, which necessitated the intervention of the Ivorian police.

FEGUIFUT Secretary General Juan Antonio Nguema Mene said the incident ""caused a major delay in the return of the team to Equatorial Guinea and also tainted its reputation”.

The statement did not give further details about the said incident, but reports suggest that the Miedz Legnica attacking midfielder allegedly created trouble when the team was checking out of their hotel by accusing the staff of stealing 500 euros (about Sh81,000) from him.

The disciplinary sanctions imposed on Nsue and Iban are part of a raft of measures taken by the executive board of FEGUIFUT following a meeting at its headquarters in Malabo, the body said on its website.

Equatorial Guinea was one of the major surprises at the 2023 Afcon in Cote d’Ivoire. The Nzalang Nacional staged an exhilarating performance, finishing top of Group ‘A’ that included eventual winners Cote d’Ivoire and runners up Nigeria.

Iban scored the Nzalang Nacional’s lone goal in their 1-1 draw against Nigeria, while Nsue scored a hat-trick in Equatorial Guinea’s second group game against Guinea Bissau and a brace in their 4-0 humiliation of Cote d’Ivoire to take his goal tally to five. They lost 1-0 to Guinea in the Round of 16.

FEGUIFUT had earlier on Monday celebrated Nsue for winning the Golden Boot.

“Five goals in four games, Emilio Nsue, captain of the Equatorial Guinea national team is the official winner of the Golden Boot at the Afcon 2023 in Cote d’Ivoire,"" it said on its X (formrely Twitter) account.

Final loss to Ivorians breaks Nigerian hearts,"In Abuja

In Nigeria, Sunday night  was one of the longest and most silent in the history of the country’s football. Fans wanted an end to the final match after Super Eagles scored the first goal against Cote d’Ivoire but they were not in control.

After the initial shock resulting from the initial goal, people turned to prayers in all the match viewing centres.

Later, hisses took over as Nigerian players faltered. Fans wanted the clock to roll over for final whistle, but their wishes turned into more sorrow.  When the Elephants took a 2-1 lead, Nigerian fans crawled to their beds in disappointment.

But characteristic of a parent, President Bola Tinubu, Vice President Kashim Shettima and other top government functionaries counselled Nigerians to accept the silver bestowed on the Super Eagles.

“Nigerians should be of good cheer; we won a great victory in the hearts of Africa and the world by our grit, rigour, and determination in the field of play,’’ Tinubu told Nigerians after the match that ended 2-1 in favour of the Elephants.

“Let this passing event not despirit us, but it should bring us together to work harder. We are a great nation bound as one by the green-white-green banner of resilience, joy, hope, duty, and untiring love.

“To those cherished Nigerian youths expressing their gifts in communities, drawing lines in the sand as they play football in their humble rectangles of play, you can be our heroes tomorrow; do not relent in your pursuit. My administration is here to make dreams come true,” he said.

Tinubu and government functionaries who were at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa to watch the match, saluted the team, coach, crew and the management of the team.  He praised Super Eagles players for reaching the final, and acknowledged the hurdles they overcame.

Vice President Kashim Shettima, who led a government delegation to the packed stadium, said that Africa was the ultimate winner of the tournament.

He stated that the tournament had served as a powerful platform to showcase Africa’s potential and resilience.

“It has reminded us of the importance of teamwork, dedication, and the unwavering spirit that defines our continent.”

He added that the tournament had showcased the brilliance, passion, and resilience of African football, and the power of football as a unifying factor that transcends race, region, or religion.

“Most importantly,  we must keep in our minds that no matter which way the pendulum swings, Africa is the ultimate winner.  The unity of Africa, our tolerance threshold and cohabitation is even more important than the victory itself.

Nigeria’s stand-in captain William Troost-Ekong won the Most Valuable Player award in the tournament.

Ivory Coast beat Nigeria to seal third Afcon title,"Abidjan

Sebastien Haller scored the winning goal nine minutes from the end as hosts Ivory Coast claimed a third Africa Cup of Nations title with a 2-1 victory over Nigeria in the final at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan on Sunday.

It was a triumph born from adversity as the Ivorians had scraped out of their group following two defeats, including a humiliating 4-0 loss to Equatorial Guinea, before finding their form in the knockout rounds with a never-say-die attitude that led them to the title.

William Troost-Ekong’s header gave Nigeria a first-half lead as he rose to meet Samuel Chukwueze’s flick-on from a corner, but Franck Kessie equalised just past the hour-mark after being left unmarked at the back post from a set-piece.

The Ivorians had to come from behind several times in the tournament and did it again when Haller steered Simon Adingra’s cross into the net, much to the delight of his rookie coach Emerse Fae, who had started the tournament as assistant to Frenchman Jean-Louis Gasset, who was sacked after the pool stage.

Borussia Dortmund forward Haller was diagnosed with testicular cancer in July 2022 but beat the disease and has been a crucial player for the Ivorians, though he missed the start of the tournament with an ankle injury, playing his first game in the last-16 win over defending champions Senegal.

His story epitomises the fight in the Ivorian side, who became the first home nation to lift the Cup of Nations since Egypt in 2006.

All four of their previous continental finals had finished 0-0, with them winning on penalties in 1992 and 2015, both times against Ghana, and losing the other two.

The home side controlled much of this year's final as Adingra was denied by a fine save from Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali, before the visitors took the lead with their first effort on target on 38 minutes.

Troost-Ekong headed into the net when Ademola Lookman’s corner was flicked on by Chukwueze and the Nigerian captain won the second ball ahead of Serge Aurier.

The hosts had an excellent chance to equalise early in the second half when the ball fell to Max Gradel in the box but his fierce shot was blocked by Calvin Bassey.

Nwabali had to beat away a superb long-range shot from Adingra but from the resulting corner Ivory Coast equalised when Kessie was left unmarked at the back post and headed into the net.

It was the home side who pushed for the winner and came close when Haller attempted a spectacular overhead kick, but the ball flashed wide of goal.

The tall striker did not have to wait long for his goal though as moments later he steered Adingra’s whipped cross into the net to crown a fantastic story.

Ahmed Musa: Super Eagles' behind-the-scenes master,"In Abidjan

Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro has explained the role of long-serving captain Ahmed Musa ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday.

Nigeria meet Ivory Coast at the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpe in Abidjan as they chase a fourth African title.

Musa’s inclusion in the AFCON squad sparked debate and the former Leicester City star has had limited playing time under Peseiro. However, dismissing Musa's contribution based solely on minutes played would be a grave mistake. Peseiro emphasises that Musa's role transcends the pitch, making him an invaluable asset to the Super Eagles.

With 108 appearances, he is Nigeria's most capped player, a World Cup goalscorer, and a champion with the team in 2013 AFCON.

“Ahmed Musa is special and important to the team,” Peseiro said. “He is my assistant. He advises me and gives me the necessary support. He is committed in his role and he can play.""

The 31-year-old serves as a sounding board for the coach, offering invaluable insights from his years on the international stage. This two-way communication fosters trust and understanding, which are crucial for a team's success.

While Musa's playing time may be limited, his presence in the dressing room and on the bench is a source of inspiration and motivation. He rallies the team, keeping spirits high and ensuring everyone feels valued and part of the collective goal.

“He has yet to play, but he has advised me about many things,” added Peseiro.

“He supports the coach who does not pick him to play. He knows better than me some of the players, Ahmed is special, amazing. He commands the team.”

Ultimately, Peseiro's vision is clear: ""We want to win the AFCON for Musa to lift the trophy."" This statement speaks volumes about the immense respect and appreciation the coach has for Musa. Lifting the trophy wouldn't just be a personal triumph for the veteran, it would be a testament to his dedication and the invisible yet crucial role he plays in shaping the Super Eagles' destiny.

The Sivasspor winger seems to have taken the role well, as he insists it’s time for him to watch others play for him.

“I had the opportunity to play for others to win, so now it’s time for me to watch others play for me to win. Whenever I’m called upon, I’ll be ready,” he told journalists.

Haller embodies Cote d’Ivoire’s remarkable journey,"In Abidjan

No player embodies Cote d’ Ivoire’s remarkable journey to the Africa Cup of Nations final quite like striker Sebastien Haller.

The 29-year-old, overcoming personal struggles and recent club disappointments, emerged as the hero in Wednesday's semi-final victory against DR Congo.

Haller, gracing billboards across Abidjan, symbolises the ""Elephants"" spirit. But his path to the AFCON final hasn't been smooth.

Haller's career was sidelined for six months in mid-2022 due to testicular cancer diagnosed shortly after joining Borussia Dortmund. He underwent two surgeries and four chemotherapy cycles, each requiring five days of hospitalisation.

His first competitive appearance for the club only came on January 22 last year against Augsburg. He shone in the Bundesliga run-in, scoring nine goals. But a missed penalty on the final day allowed Bayern Munich to snatch the title. Since then, his club form has dipped, with limited playing time and no goals since August.

Exactly a year after his return to the pitch, with his sights set on the AFCON, an ankle injury sidelined him. Despite all the frustrations, Haller has the chance to lead Ivory Coast to AFCON glory against Nigeria.

""It's going to be a tough, challenging game,"" Haller told journalists in Abidjan ahead of Sunday’s final against Nigeria. ""We've come far, gone through a lot, and are more tightly knit.""

While watching from the sidelines due to injury, Ivory Coast almost crashed out after a group-stage stumble. The France-born star, whose mother is Ivorian, returned, contributing from the bench and scoring in crucial penalty shootouts. Finally, in the semi-final, his volley sealed victory.

""Obviously, the past few years have been challenging for me and my family, so it’s beautiful to sit here in front of you speaking about an AFCON final,” he said.

From injury to hero

While downplaying his role, Haller acknowledges the team's transformation. ""We had slip-ups, but maybe we're a different team now,"" he said. Born in France and representing them at youth levels, Haller opted for Ivory Coast in 2020.

He admits the pressure associated with a cup final on home soil, but insists it’s nothing he can’t handle.

“Not at all, I love it here. Pressure is part of the game; it helps us push even more.”

Sunday's final represents both personal and national redemption, a chance to rewrite his narrative and lift the trophy on home soil.

"After rollercoaster ride, Cote d’Ivoire look to finish job against gritty Nigeria","In Abidjan

From the despair of a humiliating defeat, facing early group stage elimination, to the elation of a last-minute winner, Cote d’Ivoire’s 2023 Afcon journey has been a rollercoaster ride marked by resilience, comebacks, and unexpected heroes.

On their way to the final, set to be staged at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan tonight from 11pm (Kenyan time) host nation Cote d’Ivoire flirted with elimination throughout the tournament.

As the curtain falls on the delayed 2023 African showpiece that has served drama on a silver platter, two titans stand poised for a final clash.

On one side, three-time champions Nigeria (1980, 1994 and 2013), are hungry for their fourth crown. On the other, two-time winners Cote d’Ivoire (1992 and 2015) are fuelled by home soil advantage and a burning desire to lift the trophy after years of near misses. The Super Eagles have displayed moments of brilliance.

But their journey to the final hasn’t been without hiccups.

A 1-1 draw against Equatorial Guinea in the group stages serves as a reminder that their path hasn’t been paved solely with victories. After their opener against Equatorial Guinea was smooth sailing for Nigeria as they beat Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon (Round of 16), Angola (quarter-finals) and Bafana Bafana in the semi-finals.

Written off after early stumbles

But for Cote d’Ivoire, the narrative reads differently. Written off after early stumbles, they’ve risen from the ashes, fuelled by resilience and a touch of fortune.

Their tournament began on a good note as they beat Guinea-Bissau. However, Cote d’Ivoire’s journey took a nightmarish turn, losing against Nigeria and following up that with a 4-0 pummelling by Equatorial Guinea.

With their fate hanging in the balance, Cote d’Ivoire relied on other results to scrape into the knockout stages.

It took Morocco’s 1-0 win over Zambia to earn them a last 16 place.

“Going into that Last 16 match, facing a Senegal side that had started the tournament so strongly, everyone concluded it was the end of the journey for the hosts. But that dramatic comeback restored their confidence,” Tokelo Mokhesi tells Nation Sport.

“You should have seen the celebrations. It was as though they had already won the Afcon. But it was understandable considering how they had started the tournament.”

At that point, Jean Louis Gasset was shown the exit door and replaced by Emerse Fae, a former Reading star.

The appointment came after a failed attempt by the Ivory Coast Football Federation to bring Hervé Renard, the renowned coach of the France Women’s national team, on loan for the remainder of the tournament.

Against Mali, they played with 10 men and equalised with only five minutes to go. Oumar Diakite, a 20-year-old, rose from the bench and scored his first international goal in the 120th minute to beat Mali in the quarterfinal 2-1. And then they laboured for a 1-0 win over DR Congo in the semi-final.

Despite contrasting fortunes in the early stages of the competition, Fae insists the “playing field is level”.

Playing on a level field

“We’re playing on a level field even though we have had different starts to the tournament. They started with a draw and have had a perfect tournament. They grew into the tournament and have been stronger defensively and sharp up front.

“We didn’t start well. The two teams are on the same level. Like any game, like any final, we will try our best. We’re not going to rush anything, and we’ll focus on starting the game on the front foot,” Fae told journalists during the MD-1 press conference.

His opposite number, Jose Peseiro, said they were going all out to win the Afcon.

“Of course, a big game. The final. Good atmosphere. I think full stadium. Both teams will want to win. We’re happy to reach this final. My boys are doing a fantastic job, amazing. I’m happy altogether until now. But we want to win the final. My team is doing the best, but we want to win Afcon,” he said.

The Super Eagles are chasing their fourth continental title, having last won it in 2013.

The Elephants won it for the second time in 2015 and will be gunning for a third one.

Fae will bank on the experience of Sebastien Haller and Simon Adingra, with Seko Fofana and Franckie Kessie expected to pull the strings in midfield.

Peseiro will hope Stanley Nwabali rises to the occasion yet again after only conceding two goals in the tournament. Victor Osimhen, Moses Simon and Ademola Lookman have the responsibility to get the Super Eagles goals. The hosts have conceded seven goals and will have to tighten at the back if they entertain any hopes of lifting the coveted trophy. They have scored six goals, one less than Nigeria’s seven.

Stanley Nwabali: Nigeria's unlikely hero at Afcon,"In Abidjan

An unlikely hero - goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali - has fueled Nigeria's journey to the Africa Cup of Nations final. The 27-year-old, relatively unknown before the tournament, has emerged as a key figure, his presence anchoring a resolute defence.

Nwabali’s impact extends beyond clean sheets. He commands his backline, confidently claims crosses, and snuffs out through balls with decisive positioning. This comfort with the ball reflects his unique journey – he started as a striker before transitioning to goalkeeping.

His rise to prominence has been swift. Despite limited playing time at various Nigerian clubs, he impressed at South Africa’s Chippa United. His performances caught the eye of national team coach Jose Peseiro, who saw potential in Nwabali as a “surprise package”.

Scouting began a year prior, culminating in Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro personally watching Nwabali play in December. Impressed, he integrated Nwabali into the squad, a decision vindicated by the goalkeeper's stellar performance.

He navigated a tense penalty shootout against South Africa in the semi-final, solidifying his position as Nigeria's No. 1 for the foreseeable future.

Nwabali's composure under pressure is remarkable. He put up a sterling performance as Super Eagles beat Bafana Bafana 4-2 on penalties following pulsating 120 minutes of action, where the two nations remained deadlocked at 1-1 on Wednesday night at the Stade de la Paix.

The Chippa United goalie cemented his influence as the unlikely hero in a team that has top stars like CAF Footballer of the Year, Victor Osimhen and Kelechi Iheanacho, as he saved two penalties, in turn denying Bafana a place in the coveted final.

“Congratulations, Stanley “Pitbull” Nwabali. I call him the beast. I’m proud of you, my boy,” said Nwabali’s technical director at Chippa United Morgan Mammila, after the game.

Apart from the penalty saves, Nwabali's familiarity with South African players gained through the DStv Premiership might have aided Nigeria in the Afcon final against Bafana Bafana.

'No love lost'

And despite playing a pivotal role in Nigeria's win, Nwabali expressed his continued affection for South Africa, where he plays his club football.

“A night to remember!!! I felt every bit of it!! Brick by brick and, dreams are coming true,” he said. “No love lost at all. I still love South Africa as much as their fans love me. My name is Nwabali Stanley Bobo, and I love this team with all my heart. Safe hands.”

The Nigeria goalkeeper leads the race for the Golden Glove as he has the most clean sheets at the 2023 Afcon (four). He is at par with his SA counterpart, Ronwen Williams.

Before the Africa Cup of Nations, Nwabali wasn't a regular name on the Super Eagles roster. Nwabali, playing in his first Afcon, emerged as the preferred goalkeeper for the Nigerian national team under coach Peseiro, surpassing Ojo Olorunleke of Enyimba and Europe-based Francis Uzoho of Omonia in Cyprus.

This decision surprised many, as Olorunleke and Uzoho are more experienced players with the national team.

Nwabali hasn't disappointed, as he has played six matches at Afcon and conceded just two goals in Nigeria's Group A opening game against Equatorial Guinea and the semis against Bafana.

“I believe in all my goalkeepers – Ojo Olorunleke, Stanley Nwabali, and Francis Uzoho. I asked my friends in SA about Nwabali and went there to check on him. Thanks to Chippa United,” said Peseiro.

“Nwabali has the quality to be in goal, and he came in to fight for the number one shirt with Uzoho and Ojo, and he's done that,” said Peseiro.

The Chippa shot-stopper said he was in disbelief upon learning that Nigeria coach Peseiro would visit him at his club. He described the moment as a “dream come true,” highlighting the unexpected honour and potential turning point in his career.

“He (Peseiro) is one of the biggest coaches. Coaching a national team like Nigeria, it was like a motivation to me when he said he was coming to see me.”

Back in South Africa, where he has kept seven clean sheets in 14 outings, his club has admitted that keeping him after his Afcon performances may be challenging. Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs are reportedly interested in snapping him up at the end of the season.

In the meantime, Nwabali will continue to live his dream of representing his country at the continental showpiece, and he is just one win away from lifting the Afcon.

He will be in between the sticks when Nigeria take on the hosts, Cote d'Ivoire, in the final on Sunday, with the Golden Glove also up for grabs.

His success transcends individual brilliance. Nwabali represents Nigeria's defensive rejuvenation, a much-needed shift after their World Cup qualifying woes. He embodies the team's newfound resilience, a key factor in their run to the final.

While Nigeria boasts attacking riches, Nwabali's contributions at the back cannot be understated. He has been the silent guardian, the unexpected hero whose brilliance has propelled the Super Eagles on their Afcon journey.

DR Congo protest ‘censorship’ during Afcon semi-final,"In Kinshasa

Democratic Republic of Congo is protesting alleged censorship in the footage aired by rights holders during their Africa Cup of Nations semi-final match against Cote d’Ivoire on Wednesday night.

And the government spokesman Patrick Muyaya on Friday night threatened to withdraw the country from participating in Confederation of African Football (Caf) events until clarification is given on why protests against the war in eastern Congo were not televised to viewers during the match.

The DRC are due to play South Africa for the third spot on Saturday night and although the Leopards, as the Congolese national team is known, indicated they will honour the match, Kinshasa said it could boycott other events.

“To react to this outrageous attitude, our national team will no longer be associated, until further notice, with any solidarity activity or initiative carried out by Caf,” Muyaya said.

Kinshasa’s political leaders have been pushing for what they call ‘dismantling of the lying campaigns and other manipulations’ by the country’s enemies on the war in eastern DRC, where government forces, FARDC, are battling M23 rebels which the Congolese government blames for getting sponsorship from Rwanda.

“Every Congolese, wherever they are, has the duty to respond to the call for the defence of the homeland,” Muyaya said.

After the match on Wednesday night, a shop of the main TV distributor for Canal+ pay-per-view cable TV was vandalised. The Congolese accused Canal + of censoring footage of Congolese supporters during the semi-final match against Côte d'Ivoire.

On that day, the Congolese supporters were carrying banners denouncing “the genocide underway"" in the DRC (in reference to the war in Kivu and its many deaths) ""which is being ignored.""

Although the distributor Canal+ explained that it was only a broadcaster that received footage from the organisers, Caf, the Congolese anger did not abate.

Later, the Council of Ministers met with President Félix Tshisekedi and decided that the DRC team will not take part, until further notice, in the solidarity initiatives organised by Caf.

The DRC has also issued a stern warning to the French television channel France 24.On Friday in Kinshasa, demonstrators protested outside the French embassy in DRC.

There have also been strong protests outside the US embassy in Kinshasa.

Caf did not immediately respond to the allegations but as a member of the world football governing body Fifa, it subscribes to the tradition where political messaging is often avoided. Players sending out such messages are often booked.

However, gradually, Fifa has been accepting certain messages such as the campaign against racism or condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Wins from exciting 2023 Afcon,"In Bouake

The 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) has been a thrilling ride, showcasing the best of African football on and off the pitch. While there's still the final match on Sunday, let's celebrate some of the tournament's successes.

Rise in female referees

The 2023 edition witnessed a notable increase in female referee participation, with six officials taking the field compared to four in the 2021 edition in Cameroon.

The six females are part of the 68 match officials gracing the field at the 2023 Afcon – each carrying a torch for increased female representation in the beautiful game. These trailblazers bring a wealth of experience to the tournament, having honed their skills in domestic leagues and international competitions.

The milestone builds on a growing trend of increased representation for women in leadership roles and officiating internationally.

From boardrooms to dressing rooms, and now to the centre of the action, women are carving their space in the beautiful game, inspiring young girls and aspiring referees worldwide.

In addition, this isn't simply a numerical increase; it's a symbolic stride towards greater gender equality in football officiating on the African continent.

The match officials are Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, a qualified nurse. She broke the glass ceiling by re-writing the history books as Mukansanga became the first female referee to officiate an Afcon men’s game at the 2021 Afcon tournament.

Morocco's Bouchra Karboubi is making her debut at the 2023 Afcon, and she was the centre referee when Nigeria beat Guinea Bissau 1-0 in the group stages. Karboubi added her name to the history books by becoming the second woman to officiate a game at the Afcon after Mukansanga.

Another debutant is South Africa's Akhona Makalima. The hard-working match official is highly rated and respected in southern Africa, where she is known for her no-nonsense approach to her work in SA's top-flight - the DStv Premiership.

""I would say it has been a very good experience. There are a lot of things to learn in a short space of time and a lot of growth, I would say, because previously, in other tournaments, I came as VAR, but to perform at the highest gives me a lot of experience,"" Makalima said.

Joining the female trailblazers at Afcon 2023 is Zambia's Diana Chikotesha. ‘Super Diana’ is taking on her first-ever men's match assignment.

Cameroon's Carine Atezambong steps onto the Afcon stage, ready to make her mark. This will be her debut as a Video Assistant Referees (VAR) at an Afcon tournament.

The presence of the ""fantastic six"" on the pitch, touchline and VAR room sends a powerful message to aspiring young referees worldwide, demonstrating that the highest levels of the sport are attainable regardless of gender.

Alongside the strides of female officials, the tournament has witnessed surprising results from underdog nations.

Upgraded prize money

Before the start of the 2023 Afcon, the Confédération African Football (CAF) announced a 40% increase in prize money for the champion team in Côte d'Ivoire.

The victor of the TotalEnergies Afcon Côte d'Ivoire 2023 will be showered with a staggering USD 7 million. The runner-up won't go home empty-handed, pocketing a cool USD 4 million.

And the excitement doesn't stop there: each semifinalist will pocket USD 2.5 million, while the four quarterfinalists will walk away with USD 1.3 million each.

""CAF has made significant progress over the past two years in increasing the Prize Money of the Afcon and all its other major competitions,"" said the President of CAF, Dr Patrice Motsepe.

""We have increased the Prize Money of the Afcon Winner to USD7 million, which is a 40% increase from the previous Afcon Prize Money. I am confident that a portion of the Prize Money will contribute to developing football and also benefit all the football stakeholders, as well as assist our Member Associations with their administrations.”

The giant-killers at the 2023 Afcon

The tournament has been riddled with unexpected results, with smaller nations like Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and Comoros causing upsets against established powerhouses.

This highlights the rising depth and competitiveness of African football across the board. South Africa, whose only title came 28 years ago, made it to the semi-finals for the first time since 2000.

The upset parade signals a shift in African football. The so-called 'smaller nations' are closing the gap on established powers, leading to a more competitive landscape.

The 2021 champions, Senegal, 2022 Fifa World Cup semi-finalists, Morocco, and record African champion Egypt all exited the tournament in round 16.

On the other hand, Algeria, who are the 2019 champions, Tunisia and Ghana, failed even to make it to the knockout stage as they were eliminated in the group stages.

As witnessed in recent weeks, Equatorial Guinea unexpectedly hammered the host nation Ivory Coast 4-0, with Ghana suffering a shock 2-1 defeat at the hands of Cape Verde.

In the group phase, Tunisia also fell to a shock 1-0 defeat against Namibia. Meanwhile, Mauritania served up a shock result as they dumped Algeria out with a 1-0 victory. Mozambique also held Egypt to a 2-2 draw.

“It just shows how much football is changing. In the last four, you had a team with a dominantly local-based squad – South Africa. 20 of the players were South Africa-based, and they beat teams with players playing for top European clubs. The gap is certainly closing,” says Tokelo Mokhesi, a South African football journalist.

Off-field trumps:

Cote d’Ivoire prepared meticulously for the event, boasting world-class stadiums and training facilities that will continue serving the development of African football even after the tournament concludes.

The tournament has significantly boosted the Ivorian economy through tourism, infrastructure development, and job creation.

“There are a lot of things Caf and the hosts have done right from an organising point of view,” says Velile Mnyandu, chairman of the South African Football Journalists Association (SAFJA). “It talks about how a host country can collaborate with Caf to create the best tournament. They’ve built the training pitches in the schools.

They’ve built some in local communities.”

He gives credit to Caf for the idea of building City CAN Villages, where players stayed throughout the tournament.

“Credit to Caf, whose idea was to build City CAN as they anticipated the shortage of hotels. The City CAN is more relaxed and has a much better setup. Security-wise, it’s not easy to budge like in a hotel.

“We struggled to gain entrance into the village to interview Bafana Bafana players. Security was so tight, which is a good thing.

“The set-up is cool for the athletes with everything they need to relax,” explains Mnyandu.

While the final match promises an exciting culmination to the tournament, these successes extend beyond the pitch.

Afcon 2023 has served as a powerful platform to showcase African football's development, talent, and potential to the world. It has fostered national pride, economic growth, and a renewed belief in the sport's bright future on the continent.

""Just a few years ago, my team and I were doing gallery shows every other year with a guest list of maybe 50 people and the nagging stress of organising invitations, transportation and catering.

But today I'm in my favourite country on the planet, second only to Indonesia, surrounded by beloved colleagues, great minds and kindred spirits, not to mention local heroes and heroines,"" said the Prince.

This is not Prince Aga Khan’s first exhibition - he has been diving and traveling to the tropics for over 20 years, since the age of 14. He began photographing flora and fauna in 1996 on a trip to the Brazilian Amazon.

He has exhibited in the USA, France, Switzerland, and Kenya while publishing two books, 'Animal Voyage' in 2004 and 'Diving into Wildlife' in 2015. Some of his photos can be seen on various National Geographic blogs.

Why men are feeling under pressure to not act their age,"She’s not that kind of girl. That’s what I was thinking when some Daughter of Zion, who had recently abandoned the narrow path to join the damned on the road to hell, was living out the best of her 20s. She had dirtied our table with all manner of drinks, and I for once, was grateful for Beijing 1995.

She had money like a celebrity big-boy government official. Mbeca. Moolah. Kakitu. We had been friends since campus, she the overtly religious one, me the ambivalent Sunday Christian able only to mutter The Grace—or, perhaps more accurately, mutter about Grace, yule dame pointi wa choir.

“I just feel like I am missing out on the best of my years. I want to have my slay-slash-hoe era now so that I don’t do it when I am too old,” she says.

I know the hand that quenches me, so I don’t object. “Hoe era (are we allowed to say that anymore?), hmm?” I nod, silently, both to her, and the waiter who just passed by, a universal sign language that screams: Yes, chafua meza. Cheers, I’ll drink to that.

While the devil on my shoulder whispered in my ear and wanted to know if I was on her hit list, I could relate. For the majority of my 20s, I never felt my age. It was a pendulum, oscillating between feeling too old to do certain things, and too naïve to be in certain rooms. I spent time trapped in this chasm, a sort of man-baby, not quite man, not entirely boy.

This is something I have observed too in my male friends. Not feeling your age. I was joking with someone’s daughter the other day when a potential client ended our call with: “Keep me posted.” I told her—someone’s daughter, not client—that back in the day keep me posted just meant keep me informed.

Now, everyone is kept posted, literally and metaphorically. I bring this to your attention because living in our real-time age of notifications and updates, we are feeding on a collective fear that we are missing out on something, whether it’s a fabulous party, an “Unbeatable Sales!”—like the whole world knows something and we haven’t been let in on the secret. Life, nowadays, feels like those ‘DM for prices’ people.

The trade-off is that milestones are constantly set higher. There is a Top 40 under 40, a Forbes 30 under 30, believe you me a 20 under 20 too, and heck, if I get a (climate-facing, whatever that means) funder, I will even start my Top 10 under 10!

The markers we used to achieve at certain ages—like reading, walking, moving out, marriage—now feel less like milestones and more like monuments. There is a gnarling sense of doom, delivered straight to your doorstep, and everyone is subscribed.

It's only when you step back from the centre—the noise, the (ring) lights, the cameras—and embrace the shadows that you start putting into perspective how far you have come. In oversimplified terms, it is understanding that it is okay to readjust your sails according to the wind; to set new milestones, to actually feel your age.

It is (part of) the reason there has been a spike in young boys going after mumamas; ditto young ladies with their Viagra mubabas.

At 15, I hadn’t had a clue why I liked girls with lisps or braces; at 20 I knew I had no business being in a long-term relationship; at 28 I couldn’t find myself willingly in a club with an MC and call that fun.

At 30, you can no longer be dating potential. The truth is, time is running out. But that’s just one truth. The other truth is; that you are in control. And an even more sinister truth is – you cannot live a 20s lifestyle on a 60-something-year-old body. The arthritis will call you out. Si it’s me who is telling you?

Read: Mantalk: Men, quit complaining, it’s time to take personal responsibility

That’s another thing. Younger people think old people are fools, old people know younger people to be so. It’s my ancestors who said that what an old man sees while sitting, a young man won’t see atop Mt Kilimanjaro.

The thing here is simple, learn to live your age. Life by itself is a crapshoot: You roll the dice, and you see what happens. This is our great depression. Children can’t be children if adults are not adults, but children also can’t become adults. They need models, to look up to when young, to define themselves against as they grow older.

You play your part by being your age, I’ll play my part by being my age. For instance, at 30, when people ask, you should be able to say what you are rather than what you hope to be.

At 30, it’s time you also admit that your politics matter, you will never be needed for a national team, and you can’t wear Crocs in public. Among my peers there is a now-or-never mood: the show is still going on, but the curtain call is ringing. Hear! Hear!

What’s cute in your 20s can be weird at 30 and dangerous at 40. Do you have a pen, because I am about to sign you’re a reality cheque: This is the youngest you will ever be! I know they told you 30 is the new 20, but take it from me, it’s not.

You see, I have discovered that people don’t mind being trapped, as long as no one is free. The English said misery loves company. The Swahili got it much better, with their curt methalis: Kifo cha wengi, harusi.

“You know, I’m 26, but I feel 22. Covid years don’t count. Wacha nijibambe before niolewe!” said my rainmaker. Problematic as her statements sounded, I am not one to judge. I still collect toys of cars and action figures—a pilgrimage to a childhood lost—at my big age (sometimes I feel 17, as long as I don’t look in the mirror).

She presented her case with a half-hearted “don’t repeat this” tone, to which I nodded sensitively and murmured, “I would never,” while already scheduling it for today’s column.

As ever, compassion and empathy are the handiest of utensils. Because it didn’t matter to me what age she felt like—reality will soon deal her her cards—the only number I cared about was what position I was on her hit list.

"Pastor Kitoto: My wife is in love with a married man, but I still want her","Dear Kitoto,

My wife of six years broke up with me five months ago. She told me she wanted a break from the relationship. I love her and want her back. She said I am not the problem, but I do not understand why she left. I asked her if she was seeing another man and she denied it. But I discovered that she had been in love with a married guy for about a year. I felt hurt and betrayed but I still want her back. After a lot of reflection, I regret deciding to abort our unborn baby three years into our marriage. Could it be the reason why she fell for this man? I want to make things right and restore our marriage.

Mark Mosota





Dear Mr Mosota

Being married for six years, one would expect a certain level of growth in the way you relate with your wife. I, therefore, question the level of commitment that existed between the two of you.

It is not clear what led to the rift between the two of you and drew her to this married man. However, the six years of marriage lacked certain basic expectations. First, something was bothering this woman. Yes, she confessed that you were not the problem. But was this a way of justifying her withdrawal from you?

I believe if handled differently, the rift could have been healed.

Resolving indifference requires skills in both emotional and relational intelligence.

Read: I love older women, but for acceptance, I need to marry a younger wife

Second, her decision to move out and into another relationship, was wrong knowing that she was married to you. However, people have a right to make their own decisions.

Hurting people are more likely to continue being hurt unless they choose to turn a new leaf. Her walking away was an indication that she wanted nothing to do with you not forgetting the unresolved issues she was dealing with. Can you help her heal? I believe past or ongoing conflict requires love, patience and open disclosure of feelings.

I am cognizant of the fact that you encouraged her to abort. This may or may not have been the key reason for her move to cheat on you. In addition, her love affair with this guy while still married to you was part of her desire to find love and acceptance that she was missing. It is possible that the abortion left her feeling wounded and rejected.

But, we can only speculate because you did not talk about it. You may see her reasons for withdrawal as valid or not. But what is clear is that she has decided to move out and into another relationship.

Third, being your wife, do not force her back unless she is convinced that she made a mistake to break up with you. You are still single and I commend you for that.

Read: My ex-wife wants me back but I have moved on

However, her choice to come back through your efforts or hers should not be treated lightly.

It is going to be an uphill task.

Restoration will depend on a few key factors: Acknowledge all underlying factors that will have to be addressed before any decision is reached.

For example, 1) Why did she move out? 2) what made her move into another relationship while still married to you? 3) is your decision to remain single solely because you still have hope in restoration? 4) are you willing to pay the price of what it will take to make it work?

And finally, is your reaction based on past guilt associated with the abortion, or a clearly thought-through decision?

Read: Am I a fool for sticking with my cheating wife?

If your answer is for a restoration, first, seek an appointment with her.

Restoration is hinged on her willingness to have a sober dialogue. Second, identify her concerns.

Whether they are in the past, wounds connected with past injustices—unless resolved, can linger for a long time.

Finally, resolve the issues without pointing fingers.

Seek professional help where possible.

Jury orders Donald Trump to pay $83 million for sex assault defamation,"New York, United States

A jury in New York ordered former US president and 2024 candidate Donald Trump on Friday to pay $83.3 million to compensate the writer E. Jean Carroll whom he was found to have sexually assaulted and defamed.

The civil order, which prompted an audible gasp in the federal court, far exceeds the more than $10 million in damages for defamation that Carroll had sought.

Trump lashed out almost immediately, calling the verdict ""ridiculous"" in a statement and promising to appeal.

The jury reached its decision after slightly less than three hours of deliberations.

Trump had been in court earlier, storming out at one point but subsequently returning for closing arguments. He was not in court when the level of compensatory and punitive damages were read out by a court clerk.

A juror exchanged a smile with Carroll as the nine men and women left the courtroom after the judge encouraged them to protect their privacy.

""It's clear to me... you paid attention,"" Judge Lewis Kaplan told the jury following the verdict.

The order was comprised of $65 million in punitive damages after the jury found Trump acted maliciously in his many public comments about Carroll, $7.3 million in compensatory damages, and $11 million for a reputational repair program.

""I was not surprised (by the award) partly because his egregious misbehaviour during the trial could actually have alienated the jury,"" said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

""(Trump) is unlikely to prevail on appeal, because the (appeal) judges have great respect for Judge Kaplan, who is a very experienced federal jurist.""

Trump -- whom a jury found liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a separate federal civil case in New York -- used his Truth Social platform to fire off a spate of insulting messages attacking Carroll, the trial, and the judge, whom he called ""an extremely abusive individual.""

""We were stripped of every defense -- every single defense -- before we walked in there,"" said Trump's lawyer Alina Habba outside the court. ""I am proud to stand with president Trump... We will immediately appeal.""

Trump, 77, briefly took the stand on Thursday to deny he instructed anyone to harm Carroll with his statements.

During Trump's testimony, Kaplan limited him to three questions from his lawyers, to which he could only answer yes or no -- a precaution taken to prevent the Republican leader from returning to his custom of disparaging the court or Carroll in public.

""This is not America,"" Trump said as he left the courtroom following his short appearance.

He was not required to attend the trial or to testify. However, he has used the case, as well as others he faces, to generate heated media coverage and to fuel his claims of being victimized as he campaigns for a return to the White House in November's election.

Trump separately faces multiple criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden, and a civil business fraud case.

Habba sought to have the case thrown out Thursday on the grounds that threatening messages targeting Carroll, which have been aired in the case, began on social media before Trump's 2019 comments. Her request was denied.

Jurors were shown Trump's October 2022 deposition during which he confused a picture of Carroll for his former wife Marla Maples, which threatened to cast doubt on his claim Carroll was not his ""type.""

Last year, another federal jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and subsequently defaming her in 2022, when he called her a ""complete con job.""

Trump had been in court while he campaigned ahead of the New Hampshire primary, which he won handily over his only remaining challenger Nikki Haley, as he closes in on becoming the Republican candidate in the November election against Biden.

Mantalk: How are Kenyan women as compared to Tanzanian ones?,"Something embarrassing happened to me recently. I’ll tell you but promise not to laugh. Okay? Okay. So, I am in Kigoma, Tanzania. You know, I am a Rastafarian Anglican so I only pack enough underwear for a week’s trip. Three shirts because who covers an Adonis? I have enough room in my suitcase left for my ego, which is gigantic. Anyway, when I got here, I discovered I only carried a pair of shoes—the ones on my feet.

I could hear someone’s daughter’s voice in my head – “This is why you need to marry me!” but I don’t see how marriage and shoes are connected. Anyway, I ask the nearest Tanzanian in Nyerere-esque Swahili: “Nitapata Bata wapi?”

Read: Mantalk: Dear men, whoever said you have a right over a woman’s body, lied

Of course, everyone knows Bata, the footwear shop, right? Wrong. He points me to a building that does not look like it has Bata. I think, you know jirani is not good with the queen’s language.

I ask the man next to the building, “Bata iko wapi?” He tells me, “Go inside.” I kid you not, when I enter, it’s a club. Apparently, in Tanzania “bata” means sherehe. So, when I asked around for Bata, they thought I was looking for a club. As if that’s all I ever do. I mean it is, but still.

I am not one to question the ancestors so I indeed sat down in that Bata. Si bata ni bata ama? A friend, Brayson, from Arusha, later joined and we got talking. We were having beer at the right place and at the right price. That means the more he irrigated his throat, the more fertile it became.

I listened to him talk. I didn’t want him to stop. He spoke like his tongue grew words, and he was in a hurry to set them free.

Read: Mantalk: As a woman worries about biological clock, the man’s financial clock is ticking

When we reached Nirvana, that zen-like state in which monks climb mountains to go and meditate as if they don’t know that all they need is ABV 5 per cent and above, he finally opened up — Brayson, not the monk. Men of course do not gossip.

We “open up.” We discuss ideas over a moja mbili. We talk sharas, which is what a conman selling soil in Laikipia calls biashara. And he told me stories. Stories of how when he came to Kenya, the girls were so aggressive, that they could smell the haves and the have-nots and the have-littles, that in Tanzania they are used to buying beers in buckets, and when they replicated that in Kenya, everyone thought their table was the VIP one.

Unlike our Tanzanian sisters, he said, Kenyans “wanakupeleka mbio.” His words. Everything is a fight. “Unakanyaga pedal, yeye anaweka gear.” I wanted to know what part he would play in strengthening jumuiya ya Afrika Mashariki and whether he would consider marrying a Kenyan and he insisted on having one more beer before answering that.

Read: Mantalk: Why men should learn to enjoy solitude

No, he said. Kenyans are combative, not submissive. “Wamenizidi maarifa,” and then came the indictment: Kenyan girls are good to have fun with, not good enough to marry.

And I wanted to tell him that women are to be observed not understood, but I knew better. Just like I know that there is truth to his words. Socrates maintained that a man who lies to himself has an enemy living within.

The truth is, a majority of Kenyan women are masculine in nature. While Kigoma is a lover’s island, Nairobi is a gangster’s paradise, the reason why the phrase “Love is a battlefield” was invented. We are all wet dreams of Nairobi’s fantasies. It’s Bethlehem with a dirty mind, Jerusalem with a lascivious smile.

Read: Man Talk: How to be a real (Kenyan) man (in 2023)

Of course, maybe this all could be that jirani is putting on a show for me. That wametoa “sahani za wageni” and are hoodwinking me. Like Jesse parading all his sons before the prophet Samuel only for Samuel to ask, “Are these all your sons?” Of course, they weren’t all his sons, and the son that Jesse hid ended up becoming the king. Maybe jirani is doing the same.

But for the sake of argument, let’s say they are not. You see, floating there on Lake Tanganyika, it felt as if the spirit of discernment had descended on me like a dove, and the word was clear: Kenyans are naturally predisposed to aggressiveness.

We come from a scarcity mindset and have had to fight our way through—and crucially for—everything. That’s why in business we undercut each other, in families we pit against each other and in love and relationships, it’s a power play.

Love is a brutal, deadly game, but a game, the best there is. And men love games. Relationships are the fields in which these games play out. We grew up listening to wataalam on radio who would tell us that utamu wa ndoa ni kelele za bibi.

We internalised that gobsmack, until the point where you find a submissive woman, is seen as a weakness. Get me clearly, I do not mean submissive in the sense that one is trampled upon or does not have dreams or lives to please the other. Contrary. Submissive in the sense that all relationships exist on a power dynamic, a trade-off between power and influence—while the man holds the power, the woman has more influence.

Read: Mantalk: Not everyone wants a summer bunny’s money but...

On one of those Sundays that my mother promised me chapos in exchange for accompanying her to church, the pastor was talking about “helpers.” The verse resonated with me because we have made the term ‘helper’ look weak when in essence nothing can be further from the truth. A helper should be stronger than the one they are helping. When the man calls a woman a helper, in essence, he understands that indeed, the woman is stronger. But a man can't learn what he thinks he already knows.

Kwa jirani kwema. The grass is always greener on the other side. Maybe. But our people say he who has not travelled thinks his mother is the best cook. When you experience other cultures, you get a different perspective.

Sometimes you appreciate what you have back home. Sometimes, you see the wood for the trees. I shake my head at my younger self now, as we often do. Then again, a man can't learn what he thinks he already knows.

And when the old men in the village tell you they want to find wives for you young men in the city, you say ni mambo ya zamani hiyo. You are dot com. They know that you will eventually find out. But isn’t it impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows?

PS: I never got to Bata. Didn’t our ancestors walk barefoot anyway? Did they die?

This is why we prefer the company of pets to intimate unions,"By nature, humans are social beings. Right from birth, we are wired to seek connection and interaction with fellow humans in intimate relationships. An infant seeks its mother for breastfeeding, a child seeks its parents for comfort when troubled and adults seek each other out for love and companionship. Mutual trust, emotional availability and vulnerability, shared life experiences and a sense of security are common desires among human beings.

Much of our socialisation comes from interacting with other people, which forms the basis of who we are as individuals and how we conduct ourselves while being part of a larger society.

Read: Pet food price hikes choke animal lovers who are also squeezed by inflation

But there is a growing class of individuals who are actively choosing to deprioritise intimate relationships with fellow human beings, and pets are their replacement of choice. Often, their social batteries do not last beyond interacting with colleagues at work and the rare meet-ups with family and friends before they want to run back to their private spaces.

They choose to spend more time with things that soothe and give them peace and mental stability as an alternative to nurturing healthy familial, platonic or romantic relationships.

Pet keeping is a fast-growing lifestyle trend in Kenya. Pet owners choose animals based on their breed and pedigree, as the pets reflect the owner’s lifestyle and reputation. In essence, the pet takes the place of either a husband, parent or child.

To some pet owners, popularly referred to as pawrents, keeping animals in their homes offers psychological benefits they would not have obtained from human interactions. This is the opinion held by Nairobi-based Counseling Psychologist Mr Nelson Saitu who states that pet companionship has upsides that human relationships can’t offer.

“Sometimes pets are prescribed for war veterans to calm them down, and even in our practice, prescribing pets to clients is becoming a thing. Mainly it is about the comfort they offer. Pets can be very soothing, loving and non-judgmental. They don’t talk back or project their values, culture or religion on their owners, and don’t speak without understanding situations, or give nonverbal reactions. Pets help a person reconnect with themselves through self-expression,” says Mr Saitu.

Mr Abdikarim Hussein, a New Media journalist and social butterfly with a following of 21,000 on Facebook, is a pawrent. Occasionally, he regales his followers with tales of his rescue pet cat, Elvis, including his randy behaviour across the neighbourhood.

“I’ve had Elvis for three years now since I rescued him from a drainage culvert. It was so small and I feared he would die of starvation. I live alone and my life changed when I brought him home. For one, he soothes my mind. Whenever you find me at home, I am less stressed especially when Elvis is beside me while watching a movie. I find socialising a bit tasking beyond going to work and occasionally hanging out with my friends outside for a short while. When I get home, I prefer to be alone with Elvis,” said Mr Hussein, an avid member of the Cat Lovers Kenya group.

Read: Low maintenance, unique pets

Additionally, Mr Hussein revealed how Elvis initially disrupted his love life saying, “My relationships with women was affected. I interacted with women who ended up saying they have cat phobias and allergies when they visited my house and found Elvis. But see, Elvis is a permanent fixture in my life. I feel safer with him around and would never get rid of him just to protect a long-term relationship with a woman. A cat’s lifespan is between 10 and 15 years. I feel it would be so hard for a romantic relationship to last that long in this era we live in,” he opines.

But love can be alluring and blinding, just as some decisions can be temporary. Despite Mr Hussein’s opinion that any of his romantic relationships wouldn’t last as long as Elvis’ life, he ended up falling in love with a woman who made peace with the fact that Elvis will always be in his life. He revealed that he first had to see how his girlfriend interacted with Elvis and when she became accepting of the cat, he allowed their relationship to deepen into a serious commitment. The couple is now about to celebrate their first anniversary.

While Elvis initially disrupted Mr Hussein’s love life, in the case of Ms Naomi Mutua, a Public Relations practitioner who pawrents seven cats and fosters and rescues several others, balance continues to be key for her when handling relationships.

“Cats are very interesting animals. They are interesting to observe and be around. They are just different. I can’t really compare the nature of their companionship to the relationships I have with people because humans and pets have different qualities and bring different things to the table.

Read: The pet surgeon: Why you must castrate your pets

I think, more than anything, it is because I grew up around pets. I am comfortable having them in my home. There are times I hang out with people but whenever I see a cat, I will always approach it and try to befriend it.

Animals are less complex and judgmental, but humans have qualities that animals don’t have,” explains Ms Mutua.

She went on to reveal that even as she maintains a balance between human and pet interactions, she appreciates that she prefers her cats because they are “all different, have unique personalities and different needs, so it is interesting to hang out and interact with them.”

It is because most pets are adorable, affectionate and loyal that some pawrents end up making unconventional life decisions such as putting love on the back burner and not having children.

In 2018, Boise State University, a public research university in Idaho, America, published a research paper on why people opt to become pet parents. 27 per cent of her respondents turned out to be pet owners who revealed they deliberately chose pets over having children because they perceived their pet companions as emotional, thinking individuals, and this led them to develop a parent identity towards them. They added that they used terms such as ‘parent’, ‘child’, ‘kids’ and ‘guardians’ when referring to their relationships with their pets.

The research also found that in modern societies across the world, instances of people choosing to be child free encouraged the increase of pet parents.

Kelvin Okumu, a Nairobi based media company owner, is a pet parent to two white cats, Snow, aged four, and Flick, aged a year and a half. Confirming that his relationship status is “as single as a dollar bill”, he revealed that he loves his cats more than some people in his life, and that he is overly concerned with the wellbeing and safety of his pets.

“I love my pets more than some people out here. People can disappoint you and break your heart but a pet that loves you will not. My pets are my life. They don’t satisfy the place of human companionship but they fill an emotional void. For instance, I do feel like I’m needed and loved while at home. They keep me grounded,” states Mr Okumu.

Read: How a pet makes you happy

He adds that he is currently single and searching, but his choice of a partner will be determined by whether the potential romantic partner is accepting of pets. This is based on a personal experience where he decided “anyone who is cruel to pets is a huge red flag” and would never remain in his life.

“My decision to keep pets dictates how I live. For example, I can never choose a life partner who doesn’t like pets and would never want anyone to make me choose between them and my pets. I will always pick my pets over anyone else. There are four billion women out here, I can get one who loves pets, right? They dictate my life a lot, even where I live in Nairobi. Is an apartment pet friendly? If not, I leave,” continued Mr Okumu.

He reiterates that he is open to a relationship but quickly adds that he is also okay with being single for the next 10 years as long as his cats are around. In other words, intimate relationships are not a priority for him right now.

He further explained that his pets afford him companionship and peace of mind especially when he returns home and finds them waiting for him and needing his attention, which helps him relieve the day’s stress.

“Any cat parent will tell you they consider their pet as part of their family. Every time I remember I have some animals somewhere waiting for me to get home, it gives me peace. There are times I get home exhausted, and I find them at the door, eager for my attention. I would recommend pets to anyone who is stressed about life,” Mr Okumu says.

But pawrenting comes with financial implications. Some pawrents spend lavishly on their animals in terms of healthcare, feeding, housing and travel. The Royal Pets is a Kahawa Sukari-based pet lodge in Nairobi. Its founder, Mr Roy Oliver Oduor, also sells high end pet accessories and caters to his clients’ pet import and export needs. He has a group of pawrents who are quite ‘extra.’

“I have seen clients who treat their pets as their only family. They are not interested in conventional relationships like marriage or parenting. I find that they are different from other pet owners who have families because they go to every length to ensure their pets have everything they need to be comfortable. They travel with the pets everywhere, except to work,” explained Mr Oduor.

Read: How a pet makes you happy

“In terms of cost of accessories, it depends on what the pet is getting. Modern food dispensers cost about Sh32,000. They are expensive because they are automatic and they feed the pets on time when the owner is not around. Kennels and travel cages are also quite pricey. Big travel cages for dogs can cost between Sh70,000 and Sh85,000 and kennels made of plastic can go for up to Sh90,000. Pet carriers cost upwards of Sh85,000. They are costly because they can be carried into the plane, so there are aviation standards that must be incorporated,” added Mr Oduor.

A pet stay at his lodge costs an average of Sh1,300 a night, and Mr Oduor may also be requested to handle the pets’ veterinarian visits. He says his clients pay Sh3,000 for consultations at the vet, while treatment costs anywhere between Sh5,000 and Sh10,000 per trip.

Clients who are more attached to their pets end up spending more on their pets’ vet visits compared to pet owners with families. In his opinion, such attached pet owners end up spending much more on animals to ensure their longevity than what a parent would spend on their child.

But what makes some people become too attached to pets to the point of shunning interactions with humans? Psychologist Mr Saitu explains that in some instances, people turn to pets as a source of comfort after experiencing trauma or abuse.

“Anyone coming out of traumatic experiences with human beings mostly doesn’t want to bond with humans anymore. I would understand that.

I experienced the worst of human beings when I was young and for a very long time, I kept pets. In my adult life, I haven’t kept any because of apartment rules that prohibit pet keeping. But in my rural home I keep cats and dogs.

Read: Travelling with a pet? It’s not as straightforward

“I understand why people do it. Pets love you and they know not to disturb you when they sense you are not in a good mood. People turn to pets because they see that pets will not hurt or betray or cheat on them like human beings did. They don’t talk back or give unsolicited advice,” explained Mr Saitu.

Mr Saitu advises pet owners to find balance between pet keeping and maintaining human relationships, or else they run the risk of forming negative attachments to animals and missing out on the wisdom imparted in human interactions.

“This negative attachment may have a calming effect on a pet owner’s nervous system but pets are not meant to take care of your problems. They are meant to give you a safe space so you can find solutions to your problems. Pet owners who fail to find solutions to their life challenges become over reliant on the animals. This can affect their confidence and self-esteem. Therapy might be needed because we are trained to listen to and help such individuals overcome psychological issues that drove them to negative attachments to pets.”

"Dear men, seeking your wife’s opinion doesn’t make you a lesser man","I read an anecdote about identical twin boys, *Kevin and *Zach, who turned out vastly different when they became adults. Kevin took up a career in finance, eventually transitioning into an employer after setting up a business.

In addition, he was a committed husband and father, involved in every aspect of his children’s lives, a loving husband who invested his time in growing his relationship with the wife of his youth and well respected for his community involvement and mentorship of the young people.

As for Zach, their mother would describe him, not with words, but with a deep sigh, followed by that sound that African mothers make when a child or a husband has caused them long suffering, that neither fasting, prayers, nor threats have worked to cause a change.

Zach was lost in alcoholism, and his debauchery made his wife pack up and leave. He ended up losing his job, and were it not for his twin, he would have lost his house too. Unlike Zach, Kevin never touched alcohol.

A talk show host invited both brothers to feature in a show. Zach barely managed to get a bath and put on some clean clothes, let alone brush away the alcohol breath, while Kevin appeared looking spark and sharp.

Their stark biological resemblance was not enough to cover their equally striking, different physical appearance. The talk show host, after introducing the well-known twin, Kevin, asked him, “You have made a lot of impact in our county. Who inspires you?” Kevin paused, then said, “Our dad.”

Turning to Zach, the interviewer asked him. “What about you Zach, who inspires you?” Without losing a beat, Zach replied, “Our dad.” “Oh…but…” the interviewer attempted to hide her surprise, but the twins came to her rescue. In the uncanny way of the twins, they simultaneously said, “Our father was an alcoholic.”

My people say it is better to sire a ngiti - an obstinate, strong-willed child - than a fool (kia). A person whose folly cannot be redeemed. They are unteachable. They listen to no one and in their ignorance and folly bring destruction. It is worse when folly is in a husband since leadership is expected of him, both from a spiritual and cultural perspective.

In our patriarchal society, some husbands will never listen to their wives. They disregard any idea generated by the wife and will not seek their wife’s opinions even in matters of critical family decisions.

They make ill-informed decisions, forgetting that the other half of the gender owns half of the wisdom. On the other hand, a husband who listens to his wife connects plugs into a mystical power.

A woman’s intuition and laser focus on the finer details are what a man needs to enrich his eagle’s view of an idea. But like the Biblical Nabal, whose name means fool, he will not listen to his wife even when the king’s wrath or favour is at their doorstep.

Like our twins, Kevin and Zach, there are two types of people on our planet. On one hand, are the teachable types who look at situations, interrogate them, dissect the outcomes, and become intentional in using those lessons in their lives. The Kevins of our planet end debilitating cycles and leave great legacies.

On the other hand, are the Zachs who will copy-paste, and regurgitate what they watched growing up, never unlearning, and relearning. They perpetuate the ills and perfect the art while at it. Our father was abusive? I will be worse than him. When I cough, my kids, wife, and even the roaches will scamper, just like our father did.

Zachs transfers trauma like a baton, creating the phenomena of ‘family and generational curses.’ It is better to sire a stubborn child than a fool who cannot learn. A strong-willed child might be difficult to parent, but in their stubbornness is a boldness that will lead them towards untrodden paths.

They question the norms. They do not buy into societal dictates. They break barriers. They innovate. They leave a mark. They do not listen to naysayers and when they do, it is to use the negative talk as fuel to energise their intentions.

Most importantly, a strong-willed child is teachable and malleable. They are not scared of being different, because their sense of self-awareness is a daily curiosity, which means, they are always learning, always growing, and turning out better, for themselves and their families.

‘The Game Master' who is giving adults a chance to be young again,"1. How did the idea of starting game nights for adults begin?

Divinely, to say the least. What started as a catch-up session after many years away from a longtime friend (MC Kibunjah) turned into a brainstorming meeting which birthed many great ideas. At the time, he had a partnership with a venue and coincidentally I was looking for somewhere to host my upcoming birthday celebration. The birthday celebration ended up being a ‘Game Night’ themed evening where friends and family brought their favourite board games to play with each other, catch up and eat cake. What we did not anticipate is the fun people would have, and in this day and age, the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) we would create by posting on our individual Instagram pages. One Instastory led to another and before we knew it, everyone had a plus one at the next event, some bringing up to three guests. We realised there was a great desire for memorable experiences and we became intentional about curating such events. The rest, as they say, is history.

2. What have you observed from watching adults attend fun days and let loose?

I love games because they encourage authenticity. It is hard to pretend to be someone else when playing. It is always beautiful to see people walk into an event looking very serious and watching them mellow into their truest selves. We are currently living in a fast-paced world so I love that we are becoming more intentional about carving out time to take care of ourselves and sometimes that means unplugging ourselves from adulting and all the responsibilities it comes with for a few hours. People leave the event dirtier, happier and most importantly, lighter from having left all their burdens on the bouncing castle.

3. How did you turn it into a business?

Let us just say that as time went by there was a growing need for the authentic energy we brought, which created business opportunities. There are also several costs attached to events, hence the need for resources.



4. How has being the ‘Game Master’ changed your life?

Oh wow, I could go on forever about how my life has changed. The biggest win has been the meaningful connections and new friendships I’ve made with like-minded people who are just as competitive and outgoing. Over time we have created a community that feels like family and that to me is the most gratifying part. I am also continually learning so much given the research I do to prepare trivia questions, and I enjoy the process.

5. What kind of activities are most popular among adults?

It is hard to list specifics as most of the activities we currently do are as continually suggested or requested by our community, for example, water sports at our most recent daytime event called Memory Lane. We enjoy giving people a different experience at each event and keep ticking off old requests and receiving new ones. We’ve even ticked off rodeo bull riding. What’s next? We love to explore new suggestions!

6. Why is it important for adults to play?

The rat race will never stop unless we pause it. We spend the first half of our lives wondering why it is taking so long to grow up, and then spend the other half wishing we had the freedom, time and energy we took for granted when we were younger. Now is a great time to enjoy the present and make full use of what is left to create lifetime memories. All work and no play…? Exactly.

7. How do you juggle all these different roles?

I too wonder sometimes. I like to think of them as God-given gifts that I get to enjoy, but also have a responsibility to utilise. It has taken a while for me to gain balance and I am not there yet but wearing one hat at a time and showing up fully in the moment helps. Creating time and asking for help when stretched is also essential. I am blessed to have a wonderful support system. Plus, I want my daughter to grow up and say, “Yeah, my mum did that.”

"US SEnator Tim Scott, who ran for president, endorses Donald Trump","A US senator who sought this year's Republican presidential nomination endorsed Donald Trump on Friday in a boost to the former leader's bid to secure his party's backing to retake the White House.

Senator Tim Scott appeared on stage with the ex-president at a rally in New Hampshire, whose residents vote in the state's primary on Tuesday.

""I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of these United States, president Donald Trump!"" said Scott, who was visiting the northern state during a bitter cold snap, to a chorus of cheers.

""We need Donald Trump,"" Scott said. ""We need a president who unites our country.""

The South Carolina lawmaker was in the race for the nomination until November 12 when he withdrew, declining to endorse any other candidate.

He had hoped to become the first Black Republican president, but struggled to rise above the pack in the party's crowded field.

Regularly polling in sixth place among Republican primary candidates, the 58-year-old drew only around two to three percent of the vote, according to the RealClearPolitics average of major opinion polls.

His backing should boost Trump's so-far dominant effort to fend off challenges for the nomination from former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

The endorsement is likely a bitter pill for Haley, who is from Scott's home state and served as its governor.

CNN reported that Trump had been in discussions with Scott to secure his backing before South Carolina holds its primary election on February 24, but that the announcement was brought forward after Haley saw a bounce in support.

""He's a fantastic man,"" the scandal-plagued Trump said of Scott. ""Having his endorsement means a lot.""

""We have to unify. We have to go after these crazy people that we're dealing with,"" he added, before launching into fierce critiques of Haley.

During his campaign, Scott frequently underlined his Christian faith and the conservative values he learned growing up in a poor, single-parent household.

He was one of five Republicans appearing in the third televised Republican debate last November, as challengers for the nomination sparred over Ukraine, China, abortion and the future of the party.

Scott has expressed no interest in becoming a running mate to any of the remaining candidates, saying that being vice president ""has never been on my to-do list for this campaign.""

13 dead in China school fire: state media,"Beijing, China

Thirteen people have died in a school dormitory fire in central China's Henan province, the official Xinhua news agency reported Saturday.

The blaze at the Yingcai School in Henan's Yanshanpu village was reported to the local fire department at 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) Friday night, Xinhua said.

Thirteen people have been confirmed dead, the news agency said, adding that one person was injured.

""Rescuers arrived at the scene quickly and the flames were extinguished at 11:38 p.m.,"" Xinhua said.

The injured survivor ""is currently receiving treatment at the hospital and is in stable condition"", according to Xinhua.

Local authorities are investigating the fire's cause, and at least one person linked to the school has been detained, Xinhua said.

Yanshanpu village lies on the outskirts of Nanyang, a city of nearly 10 million.

Little information about the boarding school is publicly available, though social media videos published earlier showed young children including kindergarteners wearing smocks with the school's logo as well as older children learning calligraphy.

Xinhua did not say how many of the dead were children.

Chinese social media users on Saturday expressed outrage about the fire and called for any safety lapses to be punished.

""It's too scary, 13 children from 13 families, all gone in an instant... if there is no severe punishment their souls will not rest in peace,"" one commenter on the Weibo social site wrote.

Fires and other deadly accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement.

In November, 26 people died and dozens were sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China's Shanxi province.

In July, 11 people died after the roof of a school gym collapsed in the country's northeast.

The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.

In April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to jump out of windows to escape.

After the coal company fire in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the country to ""conduct in-depth investigations of hidden risks in key industries, improve emergency plans and prevention measures"".

Award-winning playwright Peter Njangi hosts drama icons to party,"Award-winning playwright and director Peter Njangi kicked off the year 2024 by hosting more than 100 thespians at his Sabasaba home in Murang’a County on Saturday.

During the get-together of exchanging ideas and planning, Joseph Murungu, Eric Mukolwe Wekesa, George Murimi Gitau, and John Muchwe took the gathering through exciting episodes of their most memorable pieces on stage.

Murungu caused laughter when he narrated how in a church drama he acted as a goat, but the goat owner on the stage in a fit of characterisation caned him hard, forgetting they were acting. He however said he complained later to their leader.

Murungu is famed for lighting up festivals with productions that give the audience a special food for thought.  In 2019 during the festival held at Kibabii University in Bungoma County, Murungu lit up the hall with his production Riddles of Sangoma.

At the get-together, Wekesa performed a singing game skit amid prolonged laughter from the icons present. The genre is a preserve of the youngest children at the pre-primary level at the National Drama Festival.

Njangi said that the idea of hosting eminent drama icons at a New Year fete was to have them bond together and exchange ideas.

He asked the government to be honouring some of them with end-of-the-year national awards like Presidential Commendation.

Njangi who rose to stardom in 2001 when he wrote and directed a winning play ""The Village Well"" with Kiaguthu Boys High School said the get-together would be annual for all Kenyan thespians.

Mr Njangi is the former Principal of Kiaguthu Boys, Njiris School, and Chief Officer of Murang’a County in charge of Agriculture.

Meanwhile, on January 14, the Kenya Drama and Film Festival adjudicators briefing will be held at KICD, Nairobi.

Harvard University first black female president resigns amidst scandals,"The president of Harvard University resigned Tuesday after coming under ferocious attack over plagiarism accusations and her response to anti-Semitism on campus amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Claudine Gay was criticised in recent months after reports surfaced alleging that she did not properly cite scholarly sources. The most recent accusations came Tuesday, published anonymously in a conservative online outlet.

Gay was also engulfed by scandal after she declined to say unequivocally whether calling for genocide of Jews would violate Harvard's code of conduct, during testimony to Congress alongside the heads of MIT and the University of Pennsylvania last month.

Gay, who made history as the first Black person to be president of the powerhouse university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said in her resignation letter that she'd been subjected to personal threats and ""racial animus.""

Her downfall comes after the university's governing Harvard Corporation had initially backed her after the public relations disaster of the congressional testimony.

But the body did criticise the university's initial response to the Hamas October 7 attacks that Israel said killed 1,140 people inside Israel and saw around 240 people taken hostage.

Israel's offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed at least 22,185 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.

'Racist vitriol'

More than 70 lawmakers, including two Democrats, demanded her resignation, while several high-profile Harvard alumni and donors also called for her departure.

Still, more than 700 Harvard faculty members had signed a letter supporting Gay and her job had appeared to be safe.

The resignation, first reported by the student-run newspaper the Harvard Crimson, was confirmed shortly after by Gay herself.

""It is with a heavy heart but a deep love for Harvard that I write to share that I will be stepping down as president,"" Gay said in a statement.

Gay also wrote that she had faced threats to her safety and ""racial animus"" in the wake of the furore over her handling of claims of mounting anti-Semitism on campus.

The university's governing Harvard Corporation said that Gay had ""shown remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks.""

""While some of this has played out in the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls. We condemn such attacks.""

In the United States, the anti-Semitism on campus controversy came amid a rise in attacks and violent rhetoric targeting Jews and Muslims, including at universities, since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

The president of another elite Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania, had already been forced to resign.

The House Republican who challenged Gay out during her testimony with the question about whether free speech extended to calling for genocide of Jews celebrated the latest academic's downfall.

""Harvard knows that this long overdue forced resignation of the antisemitic plagiarist president is just the beginning of what will be the greatest scandal of any college or university in history,"" said Representative Elise Stefanik.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a close US ally, has claimed that a ""whopping wave of anti-Semitism"" has ""seeped onto university campuses.""

Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial, has described it as a ""cancer.""

Former student and multi-million-dollar donor Bill Ackman claimed in a letter to Harvard's governing boards that ""President Gay's failures have led to billions of dollars of cancelled, paused, and withdrawn donations to the university.""

Gay, 53, was born in New York to Haitian immigrants and is a professor of political science who in July became the first Black president of 368-year-old Harvard.

""Leadership failure and denial of anti-Semitism have a price. Hope glorious Harvard University learns from this dismal conduct,"" wrote new Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz in response to Gay's departure.

Here are the must-read books from East Africa this January,"East African literature continues to grow and reshape itself in exciting new ways – and 2023 was no exception. The world really did take notice of the region when Tanzanian-British author Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2021. Interest in Gurnah’s work continued last year when he made a homecoming to East Africa.

But it is in Tanzania that Gurnah made a proper homecoming in 2023 – through the first ever Kiswahili translation of Paradise, now out as Peponi.

I am an interdisciplinary scholar with a research focus that cuts across journalism, creative writing, African literature and postcolonial studies. I’m also a big reader of books from the region. My highlights of 2023 range from the masterful Gurnah to stunning newcomers, a bold biography to a pacy memoir.



1. Abdulrazak Gurnah in Kiswahili

Now aged 74, Gurnah has recently headlined a literary festival in Kenya which seeks to foster conversations between and among Anglophone (English-speaking) and Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) Africa. Just the other day in Uganda, his life and work was celebrated by the creative collective Femrite.

But it is in Tanzania that Gurnah made a proper splash through the first ever Swahili translation of his Booker Prize-nominated historical fiction, Paradise, now out as Peponi.

Indeed, Gurnah’s literary interests have always hovered around east Africa, from his seminal Memory of Departure, which chronicles the sojourns of a young immigrant in search of education abroad. Haunted by the life left behind, and roiled by the uncertainties of the new lands, he seeks meaning to his life.

Mkuki Na Nyota

This echoes the author’s own pursuit, after his dislocation from Zanzibar. In his many interviews, Gurnah has maintained that immigrants do not arrive on European shores, or any others, empty handed: they have their unique tales and histories and ways of seeing the world that should enrich their adopted lands.

But it is Paradise, first published in 1994, that propelled Gurnah to international fame, following its nomination for the Booker Prize in the same year. A coming-of-age tale of Yusuf, a lad who is pawned to a merchant to offset his father’s debt, it’s a story that’s at once heart-breaking and spellbinding.

Some critics read the novel as a retake of the Biblical saga of Joseph (Yusuf in Swahili) who is sold into captivity by his envious siblings, while others read it as a parody of Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Whatever the case, Swahili readers who have not encountered the text in other languages are in for a great treat, and Peponi is a good place to start in their exploration of Gurnah’s work.



2. Kenya’s rising star

Linda Musita, debut book of short stories called Mtama Road.

In Kenya, it was the emergence of a new author, Linda Musita, that caused excitement. Her debut book of short stories called Mtama Road has been well received locally. The seven short stories (although perhaps short-shorts is more appropriate – the book comes in at under 100 pages) are all set on one road in Nairobi’s Parklands.

The protagonists of Musita’s stories all find themselves having to navigate different elements of adulting.



3. Rebirth of the biography

After nearly 30 years of obscurity, the Kenyan biography appeared to enjoy a rebirth this year, with the publication of For The Record: The Inside Story of Power, Politics, Lawmaking & Leadership in Kenya, ghostwritten for Kenya’s defence minister, Aden Duale.

A foreword is authored by the Kenyan president, William Ruto, and it prologues the crux of the story: a peep into the machinations that define Kenyan politics, with a particularly penetrating gaze into the fallout between former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta and his successor.

For The Record: The Inside Story of Power, Politics, Lawmaking & Leadership in Kenya, ghostwritten for Kenya’s defence minister, Aden Duale.

Unsurprisingly, the book found immediate traction with readers soon after its release in the middle of 2023, following its serialisation in the local press, precipitating five reprints in six months.

A book cover with a photo of a smiling African man in a suit and tie.

Still, the Kenyan biography represents a literary oddity: it’s often staid and formulaic, parroting a predictable trajectory to explain successes, never failures, of politicians and technocrats, as they look back on their lives.

In Duale’s For The Record, we come close to approximating the truth of his political motivations and his quest for power, even though we cannot infer what he intends to do with the power, now that he’s among the most powerful men in the land.

The sprightly diction deployed in the narrative could help buffer readers from the obvious flaws in a story that’s peppered as a rags-to-riches fable, even though his trading parents were people of reasonable means, within their context.



4. Uganda’s action-packed memoir

If the new memoir by the Buganda queen is anything to go by, Uganda took literary candour a notch higher in 2023. In The Nnnabagereka, Queen Sylvia Nagginda Luswata, the journalist-turned-monarch, recalls her eventful journey from New York, where she lived through most of her childhood, to her unconventional dating of Prince Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II of Uganda. The tale includes a proposal via email.

In The Nnnabagereka, Queen Sylvia Nagginda Luswata, the journalist-turned-monarch, recalls her eventful journey from New York.

“Dear Sylvia, I think I am ready if you are,” Mutebi is reported to have written to his future wife. Another elliptical line in the memoir records another milestone, thus: “On December 6, 2010, I was blessed with two more girls Jade Nakato and Jasmine Babirye born in Kampala… They’re two amazing kids.”

The phraseology does not indicate if they belong to the Kabaka (or king). A statement from the Buganda king’s office clarified the twins did not receive the special drum sounded to herald the Kabaka’s biological children, which fanned online speculation about their paternity. The royal family is blended as the Kabaka has three other children from three different women.

Here’s hoping 2024 will be just as lively.

Big plans for ailing Mombasa Stadium,"Mombasa County Speaker Aharub Khatri has announced plans to renovate the county stadium this year to ensure is ready to be used for local and international matches.

The long overdue renovation will also include the construction of playgrounds in each of the county’s 30 wards to harness talents from grassroots levels.

“We agreed to make sure that each ward has a seven-a-side playing ground,” said Khatri.

Speaking after the final match of the Kitui Flour Mills Company-sponsored Shibe Fest Beach Cup tournament at Pirates ground on Sunday, Khatri said ward representatives and himself have agreed to make sure the county stadium is renovated and put into use.

“It is a great shame that the renovation of the stadium has not been completed for so many years. We’ve agreed with all Mombasa ward representatives to ensure that the stadium is completed this year so that it can be used to benefit not only the players but even business owners,” said the Speaker.

Khatri said they have been hiring playing grounds in many of the tournaments they sponsored with fans paying entrance fees to watch matches.

“We want our stadium to be ready and utilised in uplifting the standard of play of our youths,” he said.

Khatri said together with ward representatives, they will be working to make sure there is a standard playing ground in each ward and that there will be a seven-a-side field in each ward.

Kitui Flour Mills Company representative Shariff Abdalla said they have sponsored the tournament this time around so that the youths play beach football and raise their talents in the sport.

“We want beach football to become popular in Mombasa and Coast as a whole,” said Abdalla.

The Fetuwe FC won the tournament by beating Sao Paulo 1-0 in a thrilling final match with the lone goal scored by Shafi Dawud.

Fetuwe were awarded a trophy, Sh100,000 in cash and medals to players and officials while Paulo got a cup, Sh70,000 and medals. El Control FC finished third place by defeating Kadzandani FC 2-0 and were awarded a trophy, Sh30,000 and medals.

Biographies released in 2023 reveal the rarely seen side of VIPs,"From very personal recollections to revelations of previously unknown facts, the new biographies and autobiographies of 2023 offer rich insights into the workings of the government and the people in charge — plus the chaos that exist at every level.

British writer and biographer Philip Guedalla once noted that biography is “a very definite region bounded on the north by history, on the south by fiction, on the east by obituary, and on the west by tedium”.

His description of the books that tell stories of individuals was spot-on when one considers the biographies released by big names in Kenya in 2023.

Among the persons who released their biographies this year is Issack Hassan, the former chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), who penned a voluminous book titled, Referee of a Dirty Ugly Game: In the Theatre of Kenya’s Elections — an Insider’s Account.

Then there was Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale who went to town with an autobiography, For the Record: The Inside Story of Power, Politics, Lawmaking and Leadership in Kenya.

Former Cabinet minister and nominated senator Beth Mugo also released her memoir, Early Bird, in which she lays bare the story of her life and her odyssey with the country’s echelons of power.

Dr David Silverstein, the physician who treated many VIPs in Kenya, among them former President Daniel Arap Moi and former Attorney-General Charles Njonjo, also released his biography, Heartbeat: An American Cardiologist in Kenya, in 2023.

Then there was the former Head of the Civil Service, Dr Francis Muthaura, who released his memoir, A Moving Horizon.

Others who released biographies are

Reading the works reveals another side to the personalities whose tough side Kenyans are accustomed to seeing on television screens.

For instance, who would have imagined that someone like Beth Mugo, a niece of Kenya’s founding president Jomo Kenyatta, could be conned by land fraudsters? In a chapter where she describes how she fought for public land in Dagoretti when she was the area MP, she says that she once fell prey to cons.

“I have been a victim of land swindling. After taking a loan from Barclays Bank in 1995 to purchase land in Likoni, the land company happened to have a fraudulent scheme and I never got the land after servicing the loan for many years,” she writes.

Dr Silverstein’s book illustrates how the persons we consider larger-than-life have their very human moments. He discloses that he treated former South African president Nelson Mandela in Nairobi in 1990, where he performed a chest X-ray and drew his blood for tests. When he later met Mr Mandela about nine months later, the South African icon told him, “You are a much better doctor than you think. I’m still alive!” Then they laughed and shook hands.

And whereas the public was used to a stoic, often hard-to-please Moi, Dr Silverstein reveals a man who, in his sunset years, got very excited when visiting the burial site of Jesus in Old Jerusalem and who so much treasured a brand of sparkling water sold in Israel that he brought some in Kenya to consume. In his last days, Mr Moi would also regularly watch videotaped sermons of evangelists such as Billy Graham.

How Dr Silverstein became Moi's doctor

Through his description of the last moments of Mr Moi and Mr Njonjo, Dr Silverstein opens the veil into the inevitability of death that applies to all human beings — whether you are a sophisticated, wealthy and well-guarded personality or a random pauper.

“(Mr Njonjo’s) directives on his last days were already known to all of them (his family). He did not want to be hospitalised. He did not want to suffer. Once his condition was irreversible, he wanted to be left to die peacefully,” he writes of Mr Njonjo.

However, Mr Njonjo chose a unique way of departing the earth, perhaps a final edict that he never wanted to be grouped with the mortals.

“He had made it clear that his death should not be announced until after his cremation. He did not want his family to be pressurised by the Kikuyu community to bury him,” writes Dr Silverstein.

Dr Silverstein also reveals his personal tribulations after he was accused of negligence following the death of one-time Chief Justice Zacchaeus Chesoni who was his patient. A reader can feel the relief he felt when Mr Moi, despite the questions about his competence, assured Dr Silverstein that he would remain his doctor. The doctor would later be cleared of any malpractice.

Mr Muthaura, in his book, discloses some very human challenges that have plagued his life, some that are health-related. The steely career civil servant and diplomat shares about a long health complication from a stomach ulcer that lasted from 1959 to 1972. He also describes the open-heart surgery that he went through in South Africa when he was the Head of Public Service and the Secretary to the Cabinet.

And whereas Kenyans know Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale as an abrasive leader who used to fire from the hip when he was in politics, his book reveals a more timid young man, especially in his formative years. As a Form One student at Garissa High School, he reveals that he used to be bugged by bullies who would take all his money and demand that he make their beds. He, however, found a “godfather” who put an end to his tribulations.

Mr Duale’s book also reveals the harsh life led by Kenya’s elected parliamentarians when they fail to recapture their seats.

How Moi doctor, Dr Silverstein, came to Kenya

“I had seen how some had ended up badly after one term in Parliament,” he writes of young lawmakers, noting that there are also seasoned parliamentarians who are “now broke and needy” and who “idled on the corridors of Parliament begging for lunch or fuel money from the sitting lawmakers”.

“It is not a nice picture for a former prominent leader to be reduced to penury,” he writes.

Then there is Mr Hassan’s book where the former IEBC boss admits that he bore hatred for opposition leader Raila Odinga, the media and several officials following his ouster from office in 2017. Known for his calmness and non-confrontational speeches, Mr Hassan pours his heart out in the “reflections” part of his book.

“I must say that it is also hard not to harbour some resentment against those that you believe persecuted you. For me, they were the Cord (Coalition for Reforms and Democracy) principals led by Raila, the Auditor-General, the media, as well as the chairman and 16 members of the Public Accounts Committee who appended their signatures on the witch-hunt report. You can forgive your enemies, but never forget their names,” writes Mr Hassan.

He also reckons that life changed dramatically after his exit from IEBC.

“You quickly find out who your true friends were, and those whose friendship was with your office, as soon as you exit. Sometimes your call will not be picked up or returned, and you realise that it is not personal. You are no longer in office, and your usefulness to some is over. It may be shocking to realise that many of these people were only fair-weather friends,” he writes.

The books are also a commentary on very human reactions to events. What do you do when a social media post alleges you are languishing in disease whereas it is a big lie? Mr Hassan discloses how he responded to posts about his health; posts that claimed he was suffering after leaving IEBC while it was all a lie.

Read: The history of mistrusting opinion polls

Mr Steadman, in his book, discusses how he handled a situation ahead of the 2007 General Election when lawyer Miguna Miguna, then a diehard of the Orange Democratic Party, became fiery and confrontational during the release of opinion poll results. Ms Mugo, on the other hand, discloses how she reacted to news that she had breast cancer and how she craftily evaded arrest under President Moi for attending an opposition rally in July 1990, while Mr Muthaura reveals how he reacted to news about him being a suspect at the International Criminal Court.

From very personal recollections to revelations of previously unknown facts, the new biographies and autobiographies of 2023 offer rich insights into the workings of the government and the people in charge — plus the chaos that exists at every level.

Peter Nduati named winner of the 2023 Book Prize,"Engineer Peter Nduati is the winner of the 2nd edition of the Afrika Redefined Indie Book Prize. In his book Gooka from the Village to the City, he describes his experiences and his love for the elderly. The ceremony was held at the Alliance Française de Nairobi Multimedia Library on December 15, 2023.

In his acceptance speech, Eng Nduati, 70, said: ""This prize is a challenge to grandfathers and grandmothers. They are sources of wisdom and experience. They are trusted and believed by their grandchildren. We can pass on this wisdom to the grandchildren,"" he said.

""We have an opportunity to instil in them the true values of education, hard work, generosity, respect for elders and integrity, and change the trajectory of this nation,"" he added.

The runner-up was The Leaves of May, a novel by Muthoni Maina, while the second runner-up was Back-Fence Talk and Other Stories by Caroline Kinya Mbaya.

The 2023 winner will receive a cash prize of Sh30,000 which is an increase from 2022 where the winner received Sh20,000.

The award ceremony was presided over by Ms Margaret Lesuuda, Director of Education at the Ministry of Education.

The book, Gooka from the Village to the City, is a memoir that captures the author's daily experiences intertwined with the past, making the narrative both semi-biographical and a social commentary moulded in historical, scientific and mathematical satire.

The winner of the second edition of the Afrika Redefined Indie Book Prize is a writer who exudes energy and vitality for his age.

The prize aims to recognise independently published books by Africans, with a focus on stories that address Africa's present and future (Afro-currency and Afro-futurism).

It is awarded annually and is administered by the Kenyan pan-African publishing house Mystery Publishers.

During the event, Dr Emmanuel Shikuku Tsikhungu of Kenyatta University said, ""As Africans, we should continue to write about ourselves and our cultures because if we do not write ourselves, others will, and the result could be so disastrous"".

The event saw a fusion of art, literature and open mic performance. The audience was entertained by open mic performers Oyamo Richard and Abanu (Bryan Bundi). The guest of honour urged artistes and writers to keep writing to be global citizens as envisaged in the African Union's Agenda 2063 'The Africa We Want'.

Ms Lesuuda also urged writers to write in African languages to preserve our culture.

According to the chairperson of the judges, Lexa Lubanga, who is also the founder of Kenyan Readathon, an annual reading marathon that encourages readers to read only Kenyan writers/books, the winning book must score over 90 per cent (judges' score) in the professional assessment. For a book to be considered good on Afro-currency/Afrofuturism, it must score over 80 per cent. For runners-up, books must score between 80 and 90 per cent in professionalism.

""Different books scored differently; some would be strong in writing style but fail in professionalism and theme; others would be strong in professionalism but fail in theme; while others would be good in theme but fail in writing style and professionalism,"" she said.

""It is therefore up to us to support such initiatives, as it will be a challenge to recognise them without the necessary support, resources and systems,"" appealed Vincent de Paul, CEO of Mystery Publishers.

The speakers encouraged independent writers to invest in their writing, to preserve our (African) art and culture in their works, and to be humble in their endeavours.

""From 2024, the prize will be open to all African writers living on the continent or in the Diaspora,"" said Vincent de Paul.

The Director of Alliance Française de Nairobi, Mr Charles Courdent, said that Alliance Française de Nairobi will continue to support linguistic diversity and self-published authors. In 2023, the Alliance Française de Nairobi supported over 50 book launches by Kenyan self-published authors.

A chat with Wole Soyinka during Chinese literary festival,"“You look well and sprightly,” I say, as we warmly shake hands with Professor Wole Soyinka, 89, the first African, and still only wholly one of negritude extraction, to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.

It is, I believe, fairly common to feel a tremor of intimate recognition on your first glimpse of Wole Soyinka (although, in all fairness, I have met him twice before, at a North American literary festival in 2005, and at the Storymoja Hay Festival of 2014, where he had come to show support after the death, the year before, of diplomat-poet Koffi Awunoor, during the attack at Westgate mall). Like most literate residents of the planet, you have known this presence - calm, professorial, slightly self-ironic - all your reading life.

And now here he is, here we are, at a cosy self-contained lobby at the Grosvenor House in Shanghai, China, with its old world charm and warm and polished and burnished wood décor.

If Wole Soyinka was the interior of a building, he would be this lobby. But he is an institution of world literature, and instantly recognizable – that face with its old lion of literature mane, the intelligent eyes with their slightly quizzical look, but especially that world-famous Wole Soyinka afro, now white, that literally looks like a halo.

“Hallo, again,” he smiles. “I may look well on the exterior, but inside, I do feel incredibly old.”

This Yoruba man from Abeokuta, Akinwande Oluwole Babatunde Soyinka was born in 1934 in Nigeria, and has had quite an eventful life, outside of the literary arts (as poet, playwright and novelist). In 1967, he was sentenced to two years in solitary confinement during the Biafra War by the government of General Yakubu Gowon, for appointing himself a non-State mediator.

The poet Christopher Okigbo, a contemporary of Soyinka, was shot dead during that Civil War, for picking the pistol over the pencil, in a conflict where some chose the bullet over the ballot.

Quarter a century later, Wole Soyinka, although now a Nobel Prize winner and a teacher of literature at the Obafemi Awolowo University would find himself crossing the border on a boda boda. He was a wanted man by another ruling General, Sani Abacha, aka the ‘Butcher of Abuja.’

Having sentenced Professor Soyinka to death in absentia, Abacha went on to hang the famous writer Ken Saro Wiwa in November of 1995, ignoring world pressure to release the man of letters. Saro Wiwa’s crime had been to question the environmental exploitation of the Ogoni homelands as Abacha, like an ogre, plundered it for its oil. By the time of his poison death in 1998, Abacha had embezzled over $3 billion (Sh500 billion) from state coffers.

In 1999, Wole Soyinka made a triumphant return back to Nigeria.

And now here we are, in the December of 2023, as the only African participants in this Chinese literary festival in Shanghai that seeks to answer the question of the Arts in the Age of ‘AI.’

Read: First tour of Nigeria and a moment with Prof Wole Soyinka

“I reject the term ‘Artificial Intelligence.’ All knowledge is a creation of human beings, including language, so that as a Yoruba, I will not presume to translate what AI means in English, as it is not my original language. I only have ‘artificial knowledge’ of the English language, do you see?”

I can see how this conversation is life imitating art intimating artificiality of language, but I also do know that Soyinka has been a visiting professor at both Oxford and Cambridge, those most English of places that not only compete in boat races but in giving us dictionaries (I’m Oxford).

As well as having actually taught for stints in American universities like Cornell, of course Emory, Loyola in LA, as well as UoN (University of Nevada) with visits to Duke, Harvard and Yale.

“Shall we call it not ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ but Surrogate Intelligence?” Wole Soyinka suggests.

“Chatbots, for instance, are the work of human beings, and not an act of science by AI. It did not fall like manna from the heavens, it was programmed by man. So I celebrate the human intelligence that created Surrogate Intelligence.”

“You do not see it, at all, as a threat in any way?”

Read: Everyone says Achebe is father of African literature, except Soyinka

“We can make up new phrases as we go along, like this Surrogate Intelligence, just as humans create new scientific systems as they go on along,” Soyinka says, deftly sidestepping the question. “I believe you are old enough to remember when telephone conversations were conducted through telephone operators?”

I nod, thinking of the mostly female voices from the 1980s at some Tele-Posta places across space, as one held on to be connected from a town, another country, to a different continent.

“We had fixed locations,” Wole Soyinka says. “Button ‘A’, Button ‘B,’ Button ‘C,’ Button ‘D,’ etc.

Robots do not suffer from insomnia, so they eventually replaced the Operators. Then we replaced the entire phone system. From the static, we went mobile. Satellite. Star Systems. Now we are our own operators, thanks to our artificial knowledge(s) and surrogate intelligence.”

When I remove my smartphone for the inevitable ‘selfie’ with Wole Soyinka, he becomes courteously and objectionably old school.

“Sorry, son, I don’t do selfies!”

Instead he asks the Polish Professor Dariuz Tomasz Lebioda who is there with a proper camera, carried like a bazooka, if he could do us the courtesy of an old school ‘photograph,’ us being Prof Soyinka, myself and well known Chinese poet Zhao Si, whom as Vice President of the European Medal of Poetry and Art, is there to present Wole Soyinka with the Homer Medal for Literature, for being the ‘African Shakespeare across literary genres for many decades,’ beginning in the mid-sixties with the play ‘The Lion and the Jewel,’ the novel ‘The Interpreters’ and ‘Poems from Prison.’

Just the day before, Professor Soyinka had been awarded the Golden Magnolia Poetry Award ‘for poetry that speaks to our innate humanity’ by the President of the Arts Council, Mr. Zhao Lihong.

“It is not the best of times in the world,” Soyinka says. “But then when could we last speak otherwise?”

Looking back, indeed, from the current conflicts in Ukraine by Russian invaders, the conflagration in the Congo, civil war in Sudan and Israel’s pulverization of the Gaza Strip, there are many things gone wrong with the world today, or as sings Steve Tyler in ‘Living on the Edge,’ “there something wrong with the world today, the lightbulb’s getting dim, there’s meltdown in the sky” (that one’s prophetically about global warming and climate change today)

“Still, in-spite of the fault lines, we exuberantly celebrate Humanity,” the Nobel laureate says, and then frowns. “What is human? When does ‘human’ happen? Poetry is simply the quest for ‘Human,’ and art the quest for humanity – across ideology, race, gender and religion – in us all.”

After a short pause, he adds: “It is a challenge for the poet, the writer, the playwright – and therefore our creative mission.”

“What do these awards, the Golden Magnolia, the Homer Medal of Literature, mean to you?”

“If I were to give voice to these awards,” Wole Soyinka says, “it would be that any honour be dedicated to the embattled children of the Middle East, the endangered species of the future.”

Around 12,000 infants and children have been killed by Israeli air and artillery attacks on the Gaza Strip since early October, with many dying trapped under the debris of destroyed buildings.

“The State that endangers these kids, and the States that are united in their support of it, the former must ask ‘Is what we are doing human?’ and the latter then have a fundamental responsibility to guide them back into the renewal of that quest, of what it is to be human.”

The inevitable black SUV is outside to take Professor Wole Soyinka for the next engagement.

The Polish Professor, Dariusz Tomasz Lebioda, is curious as to where Prof Wole Soyinka keeps his Nobel Prize for Literature medal.

“Actually, I lost it,” Soyinka reveals.

“What do you mean ‘lost’ it, sir?” Zhao Si cannot help it.

“To be more accurate, my publisher lost it,” Wole Soyinka says, graciously not revealing which of his many publishers. “They borrowed it, maybe to represent me in absentia, for an event. It disappeared, completely ...”

“Have you tried looking for it on e-Bay, Prof?” I risk the joke.

The Nobel Lit Laureate regards me with a wry smile. “I keep meaning to ask the academy in Stockholm to send me a replacement,” then he shrugs at his wife Folake Doherty as if to say ‘I forget.’

She is his third wife, his first one having been a British writer British Dixon that Wole Soyinka married young in 1958, with them divorced four years later.

He met his current wife when she was in university as a student, and he was a professor there.

They married in 1989, and it has been a lifelong union of love and companionship, a marriage that has borne three sons, and in spite of the three decades in age that separate them, they seem inseparable, so third time’s a charm.

It is also she who reminds me to get the autograph of the Soyinka novel I have been carrying, “Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth” (and, no, it has no Finns in it), the book he wrote when Covid-19 had them in isolation, and his first novel in almost 50 years.

Later I will look at the book dedication above his magisterial and sweeping signature – “to the memory of DELE GIWA, investigative journalist, and BOLA IGE, politician sans pareil, both cut down by Nigerian assassins. And to FEMI JOHNSON, a thorough rounded human being and rare species of the creative joie de vivre,” and realise the trio embody Wole Soyinka’s interests – creativity, politics and the kind of investigative journalism that exposes the ills of Africa.

After all, it is the continent with the unhappiest people on the planet ...

“See you in 2032,” I say, by way of farewell, to Wole Soyinka. Seeing his perplexed look, I add: “It seems I get to see you every nine years, sire. 2005. 2014. 2023 ...”

“Life is mathematical, is it not?” and then we three are waving at our reflections on the rolled up windows of the car taking the Soyinkas to the poetry recital at No.300 Hehuan Rd, Pudong.

He will read his poem there, that one that goes “the human gaze be raised skyward/ not in fear or supplication, but to hail the fall of those who spew, what in its after-burn becomes ashes ...”

They will not join us that evening for the night cruise on the Huangpu River that the Shanghai International Poetry Festival has arranged for the 22 literary folks invited to this world bund.

Going to get my jacket that evening at the Jin Jang hotel, for it is chilly if beautiful in reception and perception, like some women, that Huangpu river in December, I come across an item on Al Jazeera. The Israeli Defence Forces, as they search for Hamas terrorists, have attacked Al Shifa hospital and killed dozens, many of them children.

Aghast, I will pick the pen and paper by my writing table in that Shanghai suite, and with Soyinka’s recited poem earlier that afternoon still echoing in my mind, write my own continuation: “...vessels that bear man, and Artificial Doom/ that seed what hews the human, post-humus / and in their aftermath (math of Hamas), a catacomb of Gaza’s children’s tombs.”

COP28: Big win for Africa as Sultan Al Jaber ensures developed countries are accountable on adaptation,"In Dubai, UAE

COP28 President Dr Sultan Al Jaber's final text sets a long-term goal for climate resilience and for the first time prioritises key issues raised by the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on water, food, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, poverty and culture.

After more than 24 hours of stalemate on the final day of the world's largest climate meeting, which saw the COP28 negotiations go into overtime, the AGN had expressed disappointment and frustration on Tuesday morning.

""Let me reiterate, as we have said before, that adaptation is a key issue for Africa and an outcome on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) was our key demand.

We will not agree on anything here unless Africa's top priorities are met, which for us is a GGA framework. If we are serious about saving lives, livelihoods and protecting ecosystems, then the GGA framework must have ambitious, time-bound targets with clear means to support implementation,"" said Collins Nzovu, Minister of Green Economy and Environment of Zambia and Chair of the AGN.

According to a senior official in the COP28 presidency, who attended a high-level briefing on Wednesday morning and is privy to all the ongoing negotiations but is not allowed to speak on behalf of the presidency, there are three outstanding elements of the final text for Africa.

""We are waiting for the final text to be made official, but I can give you three key things in it.

For the GGA, which the AGN talked about yesterday, the text has set a long-term goal for climate resilience with thematic priorities for the first time, key thematic priorities that make it much clearer what we are trying to target and focus on in terms of water, food, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, poverty and culture,"" he revealed.

""The GGA text also establishes an annual ministerial dialogue on the issue and calls for an annual report from developed countries on the delivery of the doubling of adaptation finance, people will be held accountable.""

The text also emphasises ""the importance of the collective well-being of all people, the protection of livelihoods and economies, and the conservation and regeneration of nature for present and future generations"".

Another hot potato for the COP28 president is the total phase-out of fossil fuels.

""The text includes an unprecedented reference to a transition away from ALL fossil fuels, enabling the world to reach net zero by 2050.

Remember this is significantly the first time fossil fuel language has been included at this level, previously it referred specifically to coal, but now we see a transition away from fossil fuels to reach net-zero by 2050,"" he revealed to the Nation.

Thirdly, the final text takes significant steps forward and steps towards the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

"" It encourages Parties to come forward with ambitious economy-wide emission reduction targets. Key here historically, NDCs to be across the economy with focus on developed countries, the only developing country that had economy word NDCs was Brazil, now they are encouraging it across all countries,"" the senior official said.

According to the COP28 Presidency during the briefing, this borders on the momentum of the financial architecture reform agenda, which for the first time recognises the role of critical rating agencies.

""This is important for Africa and calls for an increase in concessional and on-the-ground finance, because we have seen that finance has become a key focus for Africa on the ground, and we have seen significant commitments on loss and damage (L&D), for example, and this is really a fantastic development in terms of the latest text.""

The senior official goes on to reveal that the text also includes a new specific target to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency by 2030.

""Again, finance is key for Africa to be able to achieve this, but this is significant and progressive language that is in the text.

When we go to adaptation, we know it's significant for Africa that a key focus, here we see it goes beyond the doubling of adaptation finance as agreed at COP26 by recognising the need to significantly scale up finance beyond the doubling to meet urgent and evolving needs,"" he said.

On Tuesday, African experts had pointed out the gaps in an earlier second version of the text, which Ambassador Majid Al Suwaidi , COP28 Director General, said was only meant to be a talking point so they knew where parties' red lines were.

""The latest one is much weaker than the previous one. It doesn't set clear targets for adaptation, nor does it address the huge adaptation gap between what is needed and what is currently available (in the GCC). It simply repeats the commitment to double adaptation finance from COP26 in Glasgow.

As we've seen in the UN's Adaptation Gap report, doubling adaptation finance would still leave adaptation needs five to ten times greater than available finance. Setting such a low target before the long-term finance goal is decided next year would effectively marginalise adaptation,"" said Mohammed Adow, founder and director of Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think-tank that mobilises climate action in Africa and hopes to shift climate and energy policies to zero carbon.

‘The Long Way Home’ exhibition a must-see,"It was a billboard on Nairobi's Limuru Road just after the UN turnoff and before Village Market that told us that there was an exhibition of Chelenge’s art further down the road at the Rosslyn Riviera Mall.

Chelenge Van Rampelberg, to give her full name, is an old friend. She is not old, but the friendship is. So we went.

The exhibition is in the gallery of NCAI, the Nairobi Contemporary Art Institute. We were surprised by the scale of Chelenge’s work: the number and variety of her sculptures, woodcuts and paintings.

The sculptures, particularly, are beautiful – in their textures and their lines. And the stories they tell are intriguing, provocative and, sometimes, disturbing.

To hear more about their stories, we rang Chelenge and arranged to meet her at the gallery a few days later.

The exhibition is called, ‘The Long Way Home’. My first question, when we met, was, ‘Where is home?’ ‘It is here,’ she said. ‘It is now. I feel at home.’

To reach this feeling, she has gone a long way back: to the place where she grew up, and even to the Garden of Eden. It has been a long journey, and the coming has not been without personal and professional difficulties to surmount.

I challenged Chelenge when she said that she had had no training for her work. True, she has been to no formal school of art. But, according to what I have read, as a very young child, she joined her father in his weekend hobby of making traditional three-legged stools.

From him, she learnt how to use homemade chisels, saws, hammers and sharpened nails. But when her father said that she ought to have been born a boy, she was hurt.

Many of her sculptures are about what it means to be a woman. In ‘Black Beauty’, for example, she has carved as Okot p’Bitek wrote in ‘Song of Lawino’. Remember when Lawino sings the praises of the traditional dance:

‘It is danced in broad daylight,

In the open…

Her eyes sparkle like the fireflies,

Her breasts are ripe

Like the full moon.’

But Chelenge also has sculptures that show the pain of giving birth and the weight of children women carry after giving birth. ‘And I quarrel with God,’ she said.

She remembers the time she went to church as a child – how Christ on the cross was white and the men surrounding him with spears were black. She didn’t go to church again. A few of her sculptures are of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. ‘Why is it always Eve who is to blame for giving Adam the forbidden fruit?’

It was wonderful to hear her explain the therapeutic process of bringing her sculptures to life. She talked of the initial efforts of wielding the chisel – blow after blow. She talked about the finishing strokes of the sandpaper.

I asked if it was often difficult to finish a piece. ‘Always!’ she said. It sounded like a mother explaining how difficult it is to let her child go.

She talks with her sculptures as she is shaping them. She admitted it is often difficult to let them be sold. For this exhibition at the NCAI, most of the sculptures have been lent by individual owners, hotels and other places where they are displayed. A few have even been shipped back from Japan.

Chelenge told us that before the launch she was alone in the gallery with all her sculptures. I can imagine the kind of conversation she had with them.

The exhibition is on at the Rosslyn Riviera Mall till February 17. I hope that some of you will go. If you do, your journey will be much shorter than the journey home Chelenge will be telling you through her work.

Marital rape: Day women refused to suffer in silence,"In 2019, Roselyne Belinda Achieng’ walked out of her marriage after living with her husband for only four years. She was 22 years old.

This is not what the now 26-year-old envisioned when she met her husband a couple of years ago in church. The two later got married.

Ms Achieng’ had enrolled at Kenya Institute of Mass Communication for a Broadcast Journalism course in 2014, but dropped out for lack of funds.

All seemed rosy until one evening when she had just come home, having been discharged from hospital after delivering their second child.

A few hours in, her husband demanded that they get intimate, a request she turned down as she was still nursing some wounds and was also tired.

He would hear none of it. “I just felt him on top of me and had his way with me,” says Ms Achieng’.

On several occasions in the past, he had forced himself on her claiming it was his conjugal right.

Ms Achieng’ invited her husband’s brother to discuss the issue, but this did not help.

“On the following day, his brother said it was something they did to wives, and perfectly normal,” says Ms Achieng’ who adds, however, that as far as she was concerned, her husband raped her.

Nevertheless, she chose to stay; her children needed a present father while the last born was also only days old.

The violence did not, however, stop, and though she wished to share her ordeal with friends, she knew not how to start.

Her next option was to seek help from the church, because this was where it had all begun.

The spiritual leaders advises the couple to resolve their issue amicably. What pained Ms Achieng’, however, is that no one spoke about the fact that she had been raped severally by the person she trusted most.

She felt like the church was siding with the husband instead of solving the real issue.

One day, her husband turned violent and she screamed, attracting neighbours to her rescue.

Events of the day left her husband ashamed while the bond between them grew weaker with each passing day.

Eventually, she walked out of the marriage. Her last-born son was already a year old as she moved in with her parents in Manyatta, Kisumu County, trying to figure out her next move.

“One time, I came across women huddled in a group speaking about rape in their marriages. While I did not join in, I realised I was not alone. There were more silent sufferers in matrimonial homes,” says Ms Achieng’.

She adds: “That is why I later decided to speak up. There are women across the world who have gone through similar experiences but afraid to speak up.”

She then made it habit to share her story of abuse with other women in the slums hoping she could help them open up and share their struggle.

Together with a group of friends, Ms Achieng’ would counsel the women who approached them. The group gave birth to Slum Women Foundation, a non-government organisation championing women’s rights.

It focused on ending intimate partner violence among married couples by making women understand that intimacy also requires consent, married or not.

The forum created a safe space for women to open up and share their stories in order to heal, and create awareness that rape in marriages does exist.

The organisation founded in 2019, would also donate food, sanitary towels and face-masks to women and children during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Initially, she realised that some women were afraid to speak up, they would instead be given papers to anonymously write their concerns without writing their names. This would be followed by counselling, done in groups.

“Our efforts gave birth to the Kisumu Women Writers Association,” says Ms Achieng’.

Nakuru’s calligraphy king: 62-year-old Mike Okal still at it 37 years later,"Advancements in technology have significantly impacted on the art of calligraphy, with computer aided designs resulting in better quality artworks over the long period.

It is a job not many would prefer but 62-year-old Mike Obong’o Okal, also known as Balozi, has been a calligrapher in the streets of Nakuru city for over three decades, and is not about to down his tools any time soon.

Nestled in Nakuru city's Kanu street near Bondeni Post Office, Balozi's workshop is a vibrant space filled with quill pens, reeds, erasers, oil, canvas, papers, and various calligraphy instruments.

Balozi has been a calligrapher for 37 years, a skill he self-taught when there were no specialised courses available when he started the job.

His workshop reflects a treasure trove of artistic materials, offering a diverse range of artwork, including draughtsmanship, cartoons, portraits, and illustrations.

However, calligraphy remains his standout expertise.

The rarity of the art, which reveals a complex thought process, is what has kept him in the business for long, a superlative skill he has perfected over the years.

He writes deceptively, suggesting simplicity yet the work conveys punchy social commentary probing local issues such as politics, religious differences, history and other social issues.

What sets Balozi apart is not just his longevity in the field but the depth and complexity he infuses into his art.

His calligraphy conveys powerful social commentary on issues ranging from politics and religious differences to history and societal challenges.

Balozi's artistic journey has been solitary yet steady, with his hands crafting thousands of pieces that bear handwritten messages of hope, education, and advice.

His working area, nestled in a shared space, is a testament to his dedication to his craft.

Describing his process, Balozi explains, ""I start by buying manilla papers and cutting them into an A4 size. From there, I choose the information I would want to put down from my exercise book where I write all my creative thoughts.""

He meticulously crafts each piece, considering the reader's demographic and finishing with coloured pens to bring the message to life.

“My messages are inspired by what I see, hear and feel. I pick up a lot from conversations with people, the radio and generally what I see happening around society. From this I have generated thousands of messages in which many have in their homes in different parts of the country,” says Balozi as he stares at the bunch of copies he has placed on his laps.

His abstract paintings, although seemingly straightforward, delve into intricate subjects that demonstrate his mastery.

From his early days in Mombasa to his move to Nakuru in 1999, Balozi has witnessed the transformation of his art.

“Life was not easy with the menial jobs I was doing then. I said to myself that was something I could take up since I was good at handwriting and styling letters. In my village I would be paid by young boys to write beautiful love messages to the girls they were courting or those exchanging letters with their pen-pals,” he says.

""I used to be a very bright student, in fact, this is where I got the name Balozi. I represented my school in various academic competitions in which I topped. They ended up calling me ‘Ambassador of the school’ which translated in Kiswahili is Balozi,” he says as he reminisces about his primary school days in Kisumu.

He worked at a time when there were no coloured inks and only when brown paper sheets sold at the same time while learning about sketching, painting and getting dimensions right.

The era of photocopying, laminating paper and coloured pens and internet virality of content was unheard of back then.

Adapting to technological changes, he embraced laminating and framing when plastic bags were banned, and he now displays his vibrant copies in the streets of Nakuru for sale. Balozi's dream is to pass on his art to others, emphasising the need for passion and dedication.

He envisions teaching more people the art of calligraphy, especially those seeking alternative sources of income. His legacy is not just in the pieces he creates but in the potential for others to discover and flourish in the world of calligraphy.

Despite his humble beginnings, Balozi's art has provided for his family, educated his four children upto secondar school, giving him a sense of fulfillment.

Through his dedication and skill, Balozi has not only created a livelihood for himself but also paved the way for others to tap into the artistic richness of calligraphy.

Battling GBV in Nakuru: Fidelis Wambui’s inspiring story hope in face of challenges,"For five years, Fidelis Wambui Karanja has fought tooth and nail to end discrimination against women and gender-based violence (GBV).

Despite the many verbal insults and threats, Ms Karanja is not about to give up.

Talking to her as one of the heroes in the fight against GBV in Nakuru is like reading a story of hope and willpower.

Ms Karanja’s story is of hope and resilience. She has given girls and women in the slums of Free Area, Bondeni and Kaptembwa tips on protecting themselves from perpetrators of violence.

And it is not just the wretched of the Earth in the slums who are getting the services of Ms Karanja.

A big number of the women she helps are in the middle and upper-classes. Some are professionals who rarely talks about GBV in their homes.

“A majority of middle and upper-class women rarely talk about meted on them by spouses,” she says.

“Marriage is not supposed to be a death sentence. When you feel you’re not being treated like an equal shareholder in the union, the best thing is to seek freedom elsewhere,” she says.

Ms Karanja confidently talks about the highs and lows of her daily work, comparing it like a driver who is sure the vehicle’s tyres remain in contact with the road.

She says the driver must steer the vehicle properly and apply brakes properly, sure that the shock absorbers will work.

It is these “shock absorbers” that Ms Karanja says have kept her going, adding that they have optimally helped to keep women and girls safe.

“Being a shock absorber of women and girls in slums and posh areas who suffer daily violence means you absorb the impact of abuses, disagreements, pain, torture, tears and tension,” she says.

“My greatest joy is when I reduce the tension in the life of a girl or woman by showing her the right way to fight GBV at home, work place or any other place.”

Ms Karanja says she is always ready to absorb the negativity, stress and the anxiety that comes with her work to lessen it for victims of GBV in the cosmopolitan city and surrounding areas.

“I know my life is at times in danger because of the many threats but that will not stop me from advocating for a just society through ending GBV,” stated Ms Karanja who is the founder of Young African Women Initiatives (YAWI), an NGO.

She says her work has had a positive impact on society “as it makes many feel better and comfortable”.

“It is tough to place other people’s needs before yours. That can have an impact on one’s mental health and overall well-being. Because I feel like a shock absorber, the fight against the violence must be sustained,” she added.

Ms Karanja who her upbringing helped shape her perception towards life.

“Domestic violence was the order of the day where I grew up. Because of that, I swore to champion the rights of girls and women on becoming an adult. I am happy to be living my dream,” she says.

The journey has not been easy, she says.

“Some victims are compromised by their tormentors and corrupt administrators like chiefs to withdraw the cases,” Ms Karanja says.

“I can sometimes pursue a GBV case when about to reach the end for the abuser to be apprehended, the victim withdraws.”

And that is not all. Ms Karanja has had to deal with situations in which victims come to the defence of their abusers.

“One woman even told me her abuser was mentally ill and that she had taken the decision to forgive him,” she says.

“This was a nurse who almost died at the hands of her abuser. The man attempted to strangle her with a mosquito net. She was ready to withdraw the case against him despite living on borrowed time.”

Apart from the above challenges, Ms Karanja has had to face accusations of being a home and marriage-breaker.

“Some men blame me for being a homewrecker yet it is their girlfrirends or wives who report these cases to us,” Ms Karanja says.

“They do not choose to report to police but come to YAWI. They are comfortable opening up at YAWI instead of police since we cannot be compromised.”

A woman once sought refuge at YAWI offices when her husband threatened to throw her in a dam for refusing to reveal where she was getting help.

“These kinds of threats are mostly from wealthy husbands who fear being exposed in courts of law,” she says.

Some of the cases YAWI handleS are intriguing. Ms Karanja cites a woman she offered psycho-social support after her husband of 30 years.

“This man was not comfortable with the fact that his wife was not a virgin when they met. The violence against her may not have been physical but was emotional for he kept using unprintable words against her ,” says Ms Karanja.

“This clearly shows many sufferin women have not identified GBV red flags. Victims of GBV – both women and men – should walk out of such unions. They should not be bound by factors like property as that might translate to death.”

The progress Ms Karanja has made in ensuring the right of women and girls to live free from abuse has kept her going.

“I have never felt like I want to quit. I feel great when when people get justice,” she says.

“I will continue stepping on the accelerating pedal to help identify, prevent and remedy violence at home and in the workplace, with a strong focus on gender.”

Her work faces many hurdles, chief among them being delays in courts and police stations.

“Barriers to justice are concentrated in the corridors of justice. It is annoying to see an officer demanding a birth certificate to prove that a 13-year-old girl was raped by a 50-year-old man,” Ms Karanja says.

“Sexual misconduct, assault, child abuse and related crimes do not require a birth certificate for proof.”

Part 2: Turkana and Oil,"

In this second installment of Natural Justice, we delve deep into the frustrations of the Turkana community, a result of empty promises made by the government. Gabriel Ekwe, a voice featured in this episode and a community organizer in Turkana, describes the community's initial excitement shortly after the announcement of the discovery of oil in Turkana. However, this enthusiasm took a different turn when promised job opportunities came with low pay, and decisions were made without any community involvement whatsoever.

How could something so hopeful, so promising, turn so painful and cause so much despair?

Natural Justice is a narrative podcast that  follows individuals in communities forced to the frontline of climate change conflicts around the lake region as they push back using Kenyan courts to preserve their dignity and communal lands. They face huge challenges and are sandwiched between  big government, Chinese contractors and Western corporations.

"Philip Kinyinga M’Inoti: Behold the reverend, Njuri Ncheke elder and strict colonial chief!","The introduction, growth and development of the Methodist Church into the predominant religious institution it is today in the Meru counties on the slopes of Mt Kenya was the work of white missionaries with the stellar contributions of their pioneer African converts.

The history of this Christian denomination is also the story of one of the early converts, Philip Kinyinga M’Inoti.

In this book titled, A Saint to Behold with Rev Philip Kinyinga M’Inoti, co-authors Kiriki Mwithimbu and Kimathi Kinyinga, the latter being this great man’s son, have chronicled everything as it panned out from the very beginning in the early 20th Century.

Fondly known as Biribu, a corruption of his English name Philip, the man packed a lot in his nearly five-and-a-half decades of life that ended in a tragic road accident.

This biography of the Reverend M’Inoti is also a rich and well-told account of the history of the colonialisation of Kenya, and the Christian missionaries’ onslaught against cultural traditions. European colonisation wrecked traditional African societies and exploited economies.

The so-called “white man’s burden” was used to justify imperialism and consisted of the three Cs: Civilisation, Christianity and Commerce.

From early in his life, M’Inoti had showcased leadership qualities, emerging as a champion wrestler, getting converted to Christianity and escaping a church fire in 1914 set by Meru warriors opposed to the new religion, his work as a church minister, a traditional Njuri Ncheke elder and the Chief of Miiriga Mieru before his before his death in a road accident in 1952. He was one of the five survivors of the attack on a dormitory that had 11 youth.

One of his most pivotal contributions in the 1940-1950 decade was in promoting education. This saw the emergence of Kaaga Girls School, and Meru Teachers College, with the Rev Biribu effortlessly combining his roles as a religious leader and a colonial chief.

As the authors explain, he found himself as confidant on both sides of the divide – as a reverend and a Njuri Ncheke elder but executed both with dexterity.

In the foreword, Prof FX Gichuru, writes that the foundation of the Methodist Church in Meru is seen in this narrative. It helps one to understand the culture of the Amiiru, and their interactions with the missionaries and the effects of colonisation on the people.

M’Inoti was born in 1895. In about 40 years, until his death in 1952, he served as an evangelist and an ordained minister. He was also a councillor in the Local Government, a secretary of the Njurincheke Council of Elders, and finally, the Chief of Miiriga Mieru (1948 to 1952).

Upon his death, most of his well-preserved records and research materials were taken away. His church and colonial government associates picked the best. Indeed, this was the modus operandi of the colonialists and explains how Africa’s treasured sculptures and artifacts ended up in museums in Europe.

An ally of colonial administrators

Under pressure from Africans after independence in the 1960s, some were returned but many, including the skulls of some anti-colonial heroes such as Kenya’s Koitalel Samoei, are still hidden in European vaults or are on display in libraries and museums.

M’Inoti, the authors state, was an enigma, in fact, a Meru legend. He contributed immensely to preserving Amiiru culture, promoting literacy and religion and colonial rule. He became an ally of the colonial administrators, and adopted their ways, building a stone house and buying a car in the 1950s. He also wrote several books on Meru history and culture.

His unpublished manuscripts were carted away to the United Kingdom and United States. His Wuui wiji atia! a classic Kimiiru must-read of the 1950s and 1960s, was one of his major works.

A legacy of the Methodist Church and the Rev M’Inoti lives on in schools and hospitals. Kaaga, where the Methodist Mission was first established in 1912, is today the epicentre of learning and medical care. It has primary and secondary schools, the Main Campus of the Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) and Level Five Hospital at Maua.

The story of Kaaga Mission starts with colonial District Commissioner Edward Butler Horne, the man the Amiiru nicknamed Kangangi, meaning the wanderer, for his footloose style, allocated the land for the Methodist Church Mission in 1911. This is where Kaaga Boys Secondary School stands today.

In 1908, when DC Kangangi arrived, M’Inoti was only 13. He had undergone traditional rites and was already a stickler for cultural edicts, including that forbidding boys from entering their mothers’ houses. His father had passed away when he was barely five years old.

He would later play a major role in the translation of the Bible into Kimiiru. In 1941, he was bestowed with a certificate of recognition for championing the translation of the Bible by the British Foreign Bible Society.

Philip, who had a good command of English, also tested his Kiswahili knowledge by writing his first book, Asili ya WAmiiru na Desturi Zao. This very first book written by a Meru was published in 1931.

In 1931-32, he obtained a diploma in theology and on September 29, 1932, became the first Meru Methodist Church minister.

On May 4, 1939, he bought his first car, a Ford, for the then princely sum of 1,200 shillings. He had relied on his sturdy BSA motorbike that was best suited for the cattle-trail roads of the day.

On August 28, 1948, he was appointed the Chief of Miiriga Mieru. At 55, his next door neighbour was a Mzungu DO. He built a colonial style bungalow and children were driven to and from school and his homestead guarded by fierce Alsatians.

As the Senior Chief, his flagship education project was the upgrading of Kaaga Girls School. On 15th March, 1952, Chief Biribu Kinyinga perished in a road accident. He was 57. He had been fighting traditional beer (marwa), whose imbibing was regarded as a cultural norm, and the circumcision of girls.

He was, according to the authors, “tied to the Beberu (colonialist) like the proverbial tick to a cow” and fought against the Mau Mau and thus the struggle for independence.

This book accurately showcases M’Inoti’s service to God and humanity, and his solid contributions to building the Methodist Church, schools, colleges and hospitals in Meru.

Muthaura’s memoirs and images of Kibaki,"‘In the narrative books of the Bible, ‘Zion’ refers to a particular geographic region of Jerusalem — the section where King David built his residence. However, in later books of the Bible such as the prophets, ‘Zion’ shifts from a concrete referent to something more metonymic as it comes to refer to the entire city of Jerusalem.

The way, for example, ‘Hollywood’ might refer to an area of Los Angeles or, more abstractly, the movie industry generally. This is interesting to the rabbis… They note that ‘Zion’ might echo the word “zayon”, which refers to a dry and ruined place.

Therefore, the reasoning goes, ‘Zion’ becomes a shorthand for Jerusalem only in the later books of the Bible that emerge during exile. Only when the city is lost… only when its fields are salted and its people in bondage — only then is Jerusalem called ‘Zion.’… The city is ruined, the Temple is smashed, the people are scattered. In that absence, your longing may flourish into a new song, one that lives inside your heart. Call that place Zion — the place we love from afar. My lover is mine, and I am my lover’s, but only at a great distance,” so poignantly wrote Rebecca Sacks in her novel, The Lover, on the desire one has for a better country — one that is gone — whisked back into the past.

I thought of these words when Ambassador Dr Francis Muthaura launched his memoirs entitled, A Moving Horizon, on November 3. Serving in his time as Head of the Civil Service and Secretary to the Cabinet, he and the then-President Mwai Kibaki tried to build Kenya into a “Zion” but many Kenyans didn’t understand it at the time.

He writes that they were baffled by Kenyans, especially when the government lost the “banana vs orange” referendum of 2005. He writes that, “Since the banana campaign was led by 21 ministers plus the President and his Vice President and the orange side was led by only six ministers under the leadership of Raila Odinga, the banana campaign was optimistic that it would win because its leaders’ influence had a wider population cover than the six.

“The orange side had teamed up with the opposition Kanu to oppose the draft Constitution in the referendum. When the referendum was held on November 21, 2005, the government side lost by garnering 42 per cent against 58 per cent... What was even of greater concern was the political division within the country. It was ironical that while the economy was doing very well the political division in the country was getting wider. Indeed, the outcome split the country into two…”

While there are most likely many legitimate reasons why the referendum flopped, that part “while the economy was doing well” is a place every Kenyan would wish to return to (holding everything else constant). It’s like the Zion novelist Rebecca Sacks describes as a place we long for only when the city is ruined, the temple is smashed, and the people are scattered.

A Zion we didn’t see as a great homeland then because we complained a lot under Kibaki (maybe he wasn’t a great politician). Now, the bloom is off the rose, and we are having our own version of Armageddon — over-taxation and the high cost of living has hit us with the force of a thunderclap — we are a nation in a bruising rendezvous with destiny.

I doubt anyone can read the memoirs without thinking about Kibaki, whose presidency many now acknowledge to have been great, and some even romanticise. In retrospect, Kibaki’s presidency was like sweet musical notes that wash over sheets of silk, notes as soft as cashmere, floating melodies that carry the promise of good days — a world of lightness, ease, and great economic growth.

Any Head of State after Kibaki will always have a harder time because he presided over a vibrant economy — the envy of any President even though every leader faces a different set of challenges. Muthaura has done Kenyans and generations to come a favour by documenting his life journey from his childhood on the slopes of Mt Kenya to his retirement from public service. He has served Kenya in various positions from taking on diplomatic assignments in Europe and at the United Nations to returning to the Civil Service where he rose to the office of Head of the Civil Service and Secretary to the Cabinet.

He also covers the not-so-glossy parts of his life when he is indicted for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Since Ambassador Muthaura was Kibaki’s “Fixer”, the former President, even when not mentioned, still looms large as many Kenyans remember him and his government (at least looking back) with kindness. Maybe that happens to all presidents. Maybe not. Whatever. We look forward to better days. May the future be kind to us.

In Rebecca Sacks’ earlier-mentioned novel, a character in exile says forlornly, “This year we are slaves, next year may we be free in Jerusalem.” Most Kenyans, this year, are like slaves to tough economic times, next year may we be free in our own “Jerusalem”– the place we have always dreamt to be.

"Anti-black racism is rising in EU countries, led by Germany, study finds","Racism towards Black people is growing in Europe, with Germany, Austria and Finland showing the highest rates of discrimination and harassment, a survey of first- and second-generation Black immigrants in 13 EU countries published on Wednesday found.

The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which commissioned the survey and analyzed its findings in a report, said that in the space of six years since the previous study, the proportion of respondents who had felt racially discriminated against in the past 12 months had risen by 10 percentage points to 34%.

In Austria and Germany the proportion was 64% - almost twice the previous level of 33% in Germany and a significant increase from the 42% recorded in Austria six years earlier. The next worst was Finland with 54%.

""It is shocking to see no improvement since our last survey,"" FRA Director Michael O'Flaherty said. ""Instead, people of African descent face ever more discrimination just because of the colour of their skin.""

The proportion of respondents who reported feeling racially discriminated against over the past five years rather than 12 months rose to 45% across the 13 countries surveyed, an increase of six points from the previous study. The top three were the same, with Germany's rate the highest at 76%.

The poll carried out by Ipsos for the FRA was a sweeping survey of 16,124 immigrants and descendants of immigrants across 15 countries from which several FRA reports will be produced - on other ethnic minorities and Muslims. It was conducted between October 2021 and September 2022.

This report, entitled ""Being Black in the EU,"" is the first produced from that wider survey. It focuses on 6,752 people born in sub-Saharan Africa or with at least one parent born there living in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

The proportion of respondents who said they had suffered racist harassment in the past five years was unchanged from six years earlier at 30%. The highest national rate was 54% in Germany, followed by Finland and Austria.

Portugal and Sweden were the countries with the lowest rates of harassment and, along with Poland, they had the lowest racial discrimination rates, according to respondents.

The FRA report included a series of recommendations for EU member states such as properly enforcing anti-discrimination legislation and considering a motivation based on racial bias as an aggravating circumstance when setting penalties for crimes.

World Bank warns automation of KRA systems may limit tax compliance,"The ongoing rapid automation of Kenya Revenue Authority(KRA) systems risks hurting compliance by individuals and businesses by locking out large groups of disadvantaged people such as the visually impaired, those without smartphones, internet connectivity, and limited technological know-how.

The taxman has recently gone big on automated systems including the filing of tax returns and real-time monitoring of sales transactions through electronic invoicing in a bid to maximise revenue collections.

The World Bank, however, cautioned that the shift to automated systems risked secluding sizeable groups of taxpayers with negative consequences on compliance.

“Automation of tax measures will potentially lock out segments of the public including VMGs (vulnerable and marginalised groups) and other disadvantaged groups, due to digital illiteracy, lack of smartphones, poor electricity, and internet connectivity.

This will likely lead to non-compliance by individuals and businesses” the multilateral lender said in a note on its backed programme for strengthening governance for enabling service delivery and public investment in Kenya.

Low access to smartphones remains a concern in Kenya even as the government migrated more services to digital. For example, the Central Bank of Kenya put proposals for a digital shilling on the back burner mainly due to low access to smartphones which risked locking out many.

The latest data by the Communications Authority of Kenya for the quarter to June shows that the country has about 30.8 million smartphones—a contrast to the country's overall population of about 50.6 million. It is also important to note that some individuals hold multiple smartphones.

The World Bank urged KRA to enhance tax education and ensure its tax systems accommodated all populations.

“Decentralise stakeholder engagement, and sensitise the public on the tax administration measures, including VMGs and other disadvantaged groups, and implement targeted measures to access those with disability, literacy, and mobility challenges” it recommended.

“Simplify tax education to be understood by all segments of the public and ensure tax systems accommodate all populations such as those with no or limited digital know-how, lack smart-phones, those residing in areas with poor electricity and internet connectivity” it added.

KRA’s new digital system requires trading companies to send real-time data on their daily sales via internet-enabled electronic tax registers

A review of the KRA online and virtual sales control unit shows that traders are required to give detailed information including their business name, physical addresses, and personal identification numbers(PINs) as well as those of the corresponding buyers, the item description, unit price, quantity, total price, and tax designation before any sales transactions would be approved.

The issuance of a buyer’s PIN is however optional on KRA Online & Virtual Sales Control Unit (OSCU & VSCU) -- is a software module that links the Trader Invoicing System(TIS) to KRA for processing of sales receipts.

The KRA system further demands that sales invoices detail the discount percentage offered, the total price of an item with a discount as well as the negative value of the total discounts given as part of a strategy to seal leaks.

A sales invoice will also display the total amount computed before the discount, the total tax-exempted amount, the total amount without tax, the total amount of tax to be paid and the total price to be paid. Further, the invoice will contain the payment method, and the number of items sold and contain a tabular presentation of the various tax components including goods exempted from value-added-tax(VAT), those charged 16 percent VAT, zero-rated goods, non-vatable goods and those charged eight percent VAT.

The invoices will also list the date and time of the transaction, the serial number of the OSCU/VSCU equipment, and a unique signature receipt.

Kiprugut Chumo’s family welcomes move to rename Kericho Stadium,"The family of legendary athlete Kiprugut Chumo has welcomed the decision to rename the yet-to-be-completed Kericho Green Stadium in honour of the runner who won the first medal for Kenya at the Olympics.

While presiding over Mashujaa Day celebrations at the stadium on Friday,  President William Ruto said the 10,000-seater facility will be renamed Wilson Kiprugut Chumo Stadium in honour of the legendary runner.

Read: Ruto renames Kericho Green Stadium after legendary Kiprugut Chumo

The move was greeted by jubilation by over 10,000 people who attended the Mashujaa Day celebrations at the stadium which was upgraded in a record 45 days.

Close family members of the trailblazing athlete who passed away on November 12, last year at the age of 84 after developing breathing complications at his home at Kipchebor village in Ainamoi constituency, welcomed the announcement.

“Allow me to celebrate Kiprugut Chumo, the first Kenyan to win an Olympic medal by renaming the Kericho Green Stadium after him,” President Ruto said at the tail end of his speech during the Mashujaa Day celebrations held at the stadium.

“We are grateful for the recognition of our father who is a hero in sports locally and globally, by the president who has directed that the stadium be renamed in his honour, a year after he passed away,” Gideon Kipng’eno, who is one of  Kiprugut’s sons, said.

Some family members at the stadium were surprised when the announcement was made as they had no prior knowledge of the plans, even though they had been invited to the function as guests.

“The fact that the recognition comes a few weeks before the first anniversary of his (Kiprugut’s) death is a blessing to the family, the sports fraternity and the country,” Sarah Langat, who is one of Kiprugut’s daughter, said.

Kipngeno and Sarah both said the family members were taken by surprise by Ruto’s pronouncement, just like all others who attended Mashujaa Day celebrations. Kiprugut lost his wife Ruth on October 20, 2020 after which his health started deteriorating. He passed on at Siloam Hospital in Kericho where he had been  rushed for treatment.

He became the first Kenyan to win a medal at the Olympic Games where he  claimed bronze medal in the 800 metres race (then known as 880 yards) at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

In the 1968 Summer Olympics, he claimed silver medal in the 800m after clocking 1:44.57, coming second to Australian Ralph Doubell.

Work on Kericho Green Stadium to continue after celebrations,"The upgraded Kericho Green Stadium has been handed over to the government and will host the Mashujaa Day celebrations.

Nation Sport understands that the facility, which will host various athletics and ball competitions, has been upgraded by the national government at a cost of Sh400 million and has a seating capacity of 10,000 people.

However, the construction work is not complete. The upgrade expected to continue after Friday’s Mashujaa Day celebrations that will be presided over by President William Ruto, and Angolan president Angola President Joao Lourenco who will be the chief guest.

Cabinet Secretary for Youth and Sports Ababu Namwamba said the government was committed to upgrading sports facilities in the country so as to nurture talent among youth.

“The stadium has a seating capacity of 10,000, and the VIP Pavilion holds 2,000 guests. It has changing rooms, offices, VIP lounge and other facilities that have been constructed from scratch,” Namwamba said Thursday during the handover ceremony by the contractor Modern Precast Kenya Limited in the company of Kericho Governor Erick Mutai, and Sports Principal Secretary Peter Tum.

In the 45-day upgrade, the number of gates at the facility was increased to three from two, while all the pavilions were brought down and seven new ones constructed.

“We have turned a dilapidated, forgotten and ignored ground into a facility that befits a stadium.We have done the upgrade in memory of the athletes. All league matches will be held at the stadium,” Namwamba said.

“This facility was called Kericho Green Stadium but in reality, there was no stadium in place. We now have one.It is now in the hands of Sports Kenya which will allow Kericho County government to use it.”

Namwamba said the athletics track which was removed during the upgrade will be replaced in the coming weeks.

“A tartan track will be laid inside the stadium, after the one that was installed in 2019 was plucked out to pave the way for the ongoing upgrade of the facility,” Namwamba said during the handover ceremony.

The county government laid the artificial track inside the facility in 2019 under the leadership of former Governor Paul Chepkwony but was in tatters when it was removed two months ago as athletes risked injury during competitions and training.

Kericho County Government had spent Sh110 million in upgrading the stadium, and Sh35 million in laying the artificial track, which was the most prominent feature at the stadium at the time.

“The stadium is now available for use by the immense pool of talent in athletics in the region in honour of legendary athletes from the region, led by Kiprugut Chumo, who won Kenya’s first medal at the Olympics (in 1964 in Japan) and opened the floodgates for Kenyan medalists at the Olympics,” Namwamba said.

“Kiprugut passed away last year at the age of 84, leaving behind a formidable heritage for Kenya as the home of sports men and women.”

Namwamba said the national government was working with the 47 counties to upgrade stadiums so as to promote talent among youth so as to make sports an industry.

“Within one year, with the handover of Kericho Green Stadium, we are celebrating our second regional stadium after Moi Stadium - Embu which was delivered in five weeks. There has been talk of white elephant stadiums, but that was under a different administration. Dr (William) Ruto’s administration will not have white elephant projects,” Namwamba stated.

The government is rolling out the renovation programme under a sports infrastructure master plan that also involves the upgrade of Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, and Nyayo National Stadium. It also involves the proposed construction of Talanta Stadium to international standards.

Namwamba said each of the 47 counties will benefit from the upgrade of sports facilities, while community grounds will be transformed into local facilities for scouting and improving talent.

In collaboration with Kakamega County Government, the national government is upgrading Bukhungu Stadium to international standards.

“We are in discussion with Kisumu County Government over the upgrade of Jommo Kenyatta grounds, and Moi Stadium. The same applies to Marsabit Stadium (Marsabit County), Olkalau Stadium in Nyandarua, and Bomet IAAF Stadium in Bomet County,” he said.

“The government will elevate sports into an industry and that is why the counties are competing to host 2027 Afcon matches when 11 months ago, we did not have football to talk about. The government worked with speed to have the Fifa suspension on Kenya lifted and football is truly back in full swing,” Namwamba said.

Renovation work outside the playground is not complete. The contractor did not finish work on the perimeter wall, parking area, public toilets and other facilities due to tight constraints.

“Work is till going on at the stadium. We have brought forward the handover ceremony because of Mashujaa Day celebrations. It is still a construction site with the upgrade proceeding after the celebrations,” Namwamba said.

Kapkatet Stadium is in the list of priority regional facilities that will be upgraded on merit as it is an historic ground with good location and is a hotbed of athletics talent, Namwamba said.

Governor Mutai said the government had shown it has the ability to deliver projects within deadline, including those considered white elephants.

“With the two months that this project has been delivered, is a clear manifestation that the government should not be having incomplete projects. All the projects can be completed in record time,” Governor Mutai said.

"Government to build brand new stadium as Nyayo, Kasarani set for spectacular facelift","The government will put up a multi-million football-rugby only 50,000-seater, Talanta Stadium, at the Jamhuri Sports Complex, Nairobi, Sports CS Ababu Namwamba has announced.

In what could be Kenya Kwanza government's first major sporting infrastructural undertaking costing billions, the Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani, Nyayo National Stadium and Kipchoge Keino Stadium will also undergo major refurbishment, giving the historic arenas a completely new look.

The new Talanta Stadium and the renovations of three stadiums are part of the country's plans to host the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations.

Kenya is bidding to co-host the championship with Uganda, and Tanzania while there are individual bids from Algeria, Botswana and Egypt.

Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Youth Affairs and the Arts, Ababu Namwamba said Tuesday that the ministry of defence will be the lead supervisor of the projects for “precision in execution and delivery” while his ministry will provide funds.

Namwamba, who was accompanied by Sports Principal Secretary Peter Tum, handed over the four projects to Defence Principal Secretary Patrick Mariru on behalf of the Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale at the Jamhuri Sports Complex.

Namwamba, who declined to disclose how much the projects will cost his ministry, offered that there was enough money to complete all the four projects.

Mariru promised to deliver the projects on time. He said work will start immediately with the closure of the arenas next week. “It shall be done and our work is to go backwards so as to finish before time,” said Mariru.

The Talanta Stadium project that will have several training fields for football, rugby, hockey, tennis among others, will be completed in two years.

Namwamba said the design of the Talanta Stadium that has three levels draws its concept from the shield and two spears that are Kenya’s national emblem.

“Talanta Stadium will only host football, rugby and concerts and not athletics,” said Namwamba.

However, Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret will have an increased capacity of 15,000.

All the designs of the four stadia that put into consideration the green renewable energy were done by the University of Nairobi's Enterprises and Services Limited with Professor Erastus Abonyo as the lead consultant.

If successful, it will be the first time the country is putting up a new international public stadium since the construction of the 60-seater MISC 36 years ago and the Nyayo National Stadium 40 years ago.

Speaking during the live NTV 7pm Swahii news “Hatma Ya Michezo Nchini” hosted by Frederick Muitiriri on Monday, Namwamba said he was confident that the joint Afcon bid will win

“We have brought in the ministry of defence because it has been tried and tested,” said Namwamba, adding that they will focus on three things -- speed, cost efficiency and standards.

The entire Nyayo National Stadium will have a modern canopy with energy saving lighting system while the main operation centre will target the pitch that will be overhauled with a new drainage system put in place.

The stadium will also get a new tartan running track that meets the World Athletics standards.

The media centre at the Nyayo National Stadium will be redone with the VIP area capacity increased to international standards.

The changing rooms for athletes will be remodelled to state-of-art besides the public toilets though the training venue for the Nyayo National Stadium will be at the Ulinzi Sports Complex.

“The renovations at the Nyayo National Stadium will be extended to the gymnasium and the swimming pool areas,” said Namwamba. “These are category four for renovations based on Fifa’s 2022 standards.”

Besides getting a full canopy with green renewable energy lighting system, the MISC will also get two training pitches with modern running tracks. The current pitch, running track, changing rooms and public ablution will be overhauled.

“Kasarani will have a World Athletics-approved running track since our intention is to bid for the 2030 World Championships,” said Namwamba.

Kipchoge Keino Stadium, which is a category three facility like Nyayo, will have a full canopy with modern lighting system, a modern playing and training pitch that will have underground drainage system.

Abonyo said they have designed all the arenas for easy access for everyone, both able bodied and physically challenged. ""These masterpieces will be a marvel when completed,"" said Abonyo.

"Kenya’s food, beverage sector records 5pc growth","The Kenyan food and beverage industry continues to grow with the sector recording an annual growth of five per cent driven by growing incomes, rising urbanisation, and increased consumer spending.

At least 2,500 stakeholders drawn from East Africa met in Nairobi for the annual Kenya Food Event, an event that saw 60 companies showcase their products.

The three-day event, held at Sarit Centre between September 5 and 7, 2023, attracted exhibitors across food and beverage, hospitality, manufacturing, producers, and processors.

Among the standout exhibitors at this year's event was Go Pro Foods, with its leading brand, BHEEMS.

Go Pro Foods Managing Director Raj Ram said Kenya alone boasts approximately 1,200 food and beverage manufacturers, ranging from small-scale enterprises to multinational corporations.

This makes, he said, the country a premier destination for businesses seeking to explore new opportunities, connect with industry leaders, and discover the latest products.

He said there is immense interest from international buyers and distributors looking for Kenyan products with Nairobi leading the charge with the highest consumer food and beverage spending power, further highlighting the region's potential.

“The Food Expo has not only allowed us to expose our products and brand to local distributors and international buyers, but also allowed us to meet fellow exhibitors, and learn about their experiences, the products they offer, and discuss the possibility of collaborating or partnering on business opportunities,” said Mr Ram.

He said that at Go Pro Foods, they are driven by a mission to transform and enrich the lives of people and communities across Africa, riding on the adage of “farm-to-table” to ensure that it provides nutritious food to its customers at an accessible price.

“Enrichment of life must start from your health. We look forward to getting involved in local sustainable projects surrounding farming, water, cooking, education, and health,” he said.

The MD said at BHEEMS, they put a strong emphasis on quality and safety in its food products with their facility comprising second-generation plants.

Consequently, their products are in major modern trade networks and they are looking forward to future collaborations as well as extending their distribution network in the general trade.

“We process our products twice to ensure maximum impurities are removed. Furthermore, we have an in-house quality assurance manager to ensure all products are tested rigorously upon entry into the premises, throughout processing, and batch tested following packaging ready for dispatch,” he said.

Teaser: Natural Justice,"

Kenya is one of the Lake region countries that is vulnerable to climate change. A slight weather change pattern means communities are faced with drought and flooding. On the other hand, the coastal towns face the risk of a climate change-induced sea level rise that threatens to submerge islands in a few decades.

Kenya is among the first African states to establish progressive climate legislation but the country also continues to support investments in extractive industries in support of development, the effect is that these industries are destroying local communities’ livelihoods and keeping the country in an unsustainable path.

A conflict between the government's policies on development and Kenya’s constitution’s commitment to fighting effects of climate change finds an arena in many rural communities that are now invited to make hard choices for themselves and future generations.

In this narrative podcast series, Natural Justice, we follow individuals in communities forced to the frontline of this conflict as they push back using Kenyan courts to preserve their dignity and communal lands. They face huge challenges and are sandwiched between  big government, Chinese contractors and Western corporations

CDSC boss Nkoregamba Mwebesa resigns,"Nkoregamba Mwebesa has resigned from the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC), 3 years and 5 months after taking up the job.

CDSC General Manager for Business Support Services and Chief Finance Officer, Jesse Kagoma, has now been appointed to take over the leadership of the entity effective September 1.

Mr Mwebesa will be remembered notably for the launch of the Securities and Lending Borrowing programme in February 2022, a programme designed to unlock activity in Kenya’s capital markets through allowing investors holding stocks for the long-term to lend to those keen on short-term gains. The product has, however, struggled to register traction thus far.

Mr Mwebesa previously served as the CEO of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) during its boom years between 2005 and 2008.

“The Board of Directors of the Central Depository & Settlement Corporation Limited announces the resignation of Nkoregamba Mwebesa as Chief Executive of the Corporation. Mr Nkoregamba has been at the helm of the Company since February 2020 and has steadily steered CDSC through the persistent business headwinds during and after the Covid-19 pandemic,” a CDSC statement says.

“Mr Mwebesa exits to pursue other career interests. The Board appreciates his invaluable input and leadership and wishes him all the best in all his future pursuits.”

CDSC is a limited liability company which provides automated clearing, delivery and settlement facilities in respect of transactions carried out at NSE as well as holding of listed and non-listed securities, including other documents of title on behalf of investors.

Learning lessons from Covid will protect Africa and the world from future pandemics,"The 194 member states of the World Health Organization are currently negotiating the first pandemic accord. Acknowledging that the world learned many hard lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic, governments have agreed that effective mechanisms must be put in place to prevent, prepare, and better respond to the next global health threat.

The African region has been repeatedly subjected to the devastation associated with pandemics, natural disasters, and conflict. It is clear that we need to invest in responsive and resilient health systems, accompanied by strong community engagement. Strengthened health systems, societies, along with new tools and mechanisms will be invaluable in the development of the pandemic accord.

Africa has recently been exposed to multiple outbreaks of Ebola, cholera, and COVID-19, some occurring simultaneously. Despite our resource constraints, we have a wealth of experience with responding to multiple outbreaks. We have, however, been the last continent to receive supplies, despite being the one with the greatest needs. And the region continues to grapple with non-communicable diseases, and the ongoing challenges of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in the midst of Covid 19.

Nations now negotiating the accord include every country on the African continent. Further, the International Health Regulations (IHR), an overarching legal framework that defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies with the potential to cross borders, are also being amended in the wake of the pandemic. What do these developments mean?

First, it is not only the African region that needs the accord and stronger IHR. The whole world needs it, particularly to prevent outbreaks from becoming pandemics through rapid and effective collective response. But even that is not enough. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the world witnessed the best and worst of humanity. On the one hand, the development of vaccines and sharing of knowledge by scientists across the world were unprecedented. On the other hand, there was a lack of equitable access to these scientific endeavours, with countries being ostracised for sharing information.

The inequities of the distribution of Covid vaccines were more acute for many countries in the Global South, which had limited supplies and no capacity to produce vaccine to meet their needs, forcing them to the back of the queue. The sharing of pandemic pathogens and genetic sequencing contributes to risk assessment as well as prompt introduction of containment measures and R&D for new products. Such sharing should not lead to punitive measures nor be a disincentive for those who willingly provide such information.

A pandemic accord would enhance collaboration, improve the unity of the world’s response, address the equity with which that response is carried out, and increase the speed and efficacy of preparedness and response measures.

In addition to five negotiating sessions on the pandemic accord that were held by all Member States of WHO, with a sixth to be held in July, the African region has convened region-specific consultations and sessions devoted to specific topics such as equity. Three sessions on proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations have also been held with a fourth to be held in July.

The accord represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect the world from a future pandemic. It is vital that we heed the lessons of Covid-19 to make quantum improvements in the way the world prevents, prepares for, and responds to infectious disease threats.

These 194 sovereign governments—and they alone—can decide what should be included in the accord and how the International Health Regulations are amended. The accord and the amendments will be presented to the World Health Assembly in May 24.

Please join us in supporting your government to help determine the best possible measures to protect us all from the next pandemic. Everyone, from children to parents to health workers, all stand to benefit.

The H. pylori menace causing antibiotic resistance,"Last week, a member of the family fell sick and was taken to the hospital. She was complaining of nausea, vomiting, headache, fever and neck muscle discomfort. The doctor at the emergency department conducted a few tests, including a full blood count and a stool test for the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antigen test, which was found to be positive. She was sent home with a sack of medication to treat the H. pylori infection.

Two days later, her condition had worsened, with dehydration and weakness. A repeat consultation with malaria testing led to a positive malaria test and appropriate treatment for the same. Thankfully she is on the way to recovery.

In the same week, a patient of mine called for a second opinion. I have not seen her for some time. Last week, she visited an outpatient facility feeling nauseous, with general fatigue and body weakness. She was subjected to a battery of tests, including the H.pylori test. Despite requesting for a pregnancy test, it wasn’t conducted. With a positive H. pylori antigen test, she was sent home with her own little package of medications.

She gave up on the medication on the fifth day due to the side effects and proceeded to grab a commercial pregnancy test kit off the counter at her local pharmacy. The test was positive, prompting the call. She was worried about the effect of the medication on her developing baby. Her symptoms were simply a result of her first-trimester pregnancy.

Meanwhile, a friend called for a referral to a paediatric gastroenterologist. She complained that her daughter, who is barely six, is on her third course of H. pylori treatment in a year. She was fed up! She wanted to seek a second opinion because she was not convinced this is what her daughter needed.

All these calls came through in a span of less than three days. When the pharmaceutical industry cried foul over the misuse of H. pylori testing and treatment, many doctors shunned them and assumed they did not want to pay for the cost of care. However, it is becoming clear that, for a number of doctors and clinical officers in the emergency and outpatient departments, especially in the major towns, when there is no other explanation for the patient’s symptoms, then H. pylori infection becomes the fallback diagnosis.

What is disheartening is that most of these patients are not seen continuously by the same doctors or clinicians, hence they fail to note how these treatments are not even helping relieve the symptoms they were trying to alleviate.

The treatment for H. pylori is extremely expensive, ranging from an average of Sh6,000 to Sh14,000 for a course of medication. Throw in the consultation fees and the tests and a single visit will cost anything from Sh15,000 to 25,000.

To put this into context, evidence points to at least one in two persons walking around, harbouring this notorious bacterium in their stomach. It is fascinating to hear patients referring to the bacteria instead of the condition it supposedly causes. I have never heard of a patient reporting to be carrying Plasmodium falciparum infection. They simply state that they have malaria! So, what is different in this case?

H. pylori is a unique bacterium that has the ability to survive in the stomach, in a hostile environment where most bacteria are almost instantly pulverised by the high acid levels within the stomach. It is transmitted through the faeco-oral route, meaning one literally swallowed it in food or drink, contaminated by stool from a person infected by H. pylori. Children tend to get infected from age three to around five for the first time. The infection is more common among children than adults. One can get re-infected throughout life, even after treatment.

To this end then, what are the treatment guidelines? For children, test for H. pylori, only if the child demonstrates obvious symptoms. These include children confirmed to have peptic ulcers, children with a family history of gastric (stomach) cancer, and children with a special type of cancer called Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (MALToma). Minor symptoms of dyspepsia do not warrant testing for H. pylori.

For adults, the same guidelines apply, and in addition, patients <60 years, who have dyspepsia without a proper diagnosis of the cause, patients who require to be put on long-term treatment by a specific group of drugs called NSAIDS, and patients who have unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia.

The biggest fright with regard to the presence of H. pylori is that it remains a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer and MALTomas, hence the reason for patients with this risk profile being subjected to testing and treatment. It is important to realise that a risk factor is not a cause of cancer. Several other factors come into play, to determine whether a person ultimately gets cancer or not. An important caution with regard to the treatment of H. pylori is that this bacterium is responsive to a small range of antibiotics to eradicate it. The treatment is usually a combination of at least two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI - a drug that disables the stomach’s acid-making capacity, reducing acid and allowing the lining of the stomach to heal faster); the infamous triple therapy kit.

More importantly is that within this range of antibiotics, H. pylori has a very high rate of developing resistance. Unfortunately, most of these medications are also rather unpalatable, compromising the patient’s ability to comply with the treatment regimen. Many patients give up after sustained nausea, vomiting, metallic taste and itching.

The repeated incomplete treatments we are seeing across board are resulting in increased antimicrobial resistance; yet the patients being treated do not require the treatment in the first place! We need to put a stop to this menace! Antimicrobial resistance is our currently developing pandemic. We can avert this course if we put our foot down and say no to unnecessary triple therapy kits!

Keeping obesity at bay,"Dr Flo,

I am shocked by the revelation that half of educated women of reproductive age in Kenya are overweight or obese, according to the recently released Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS) 2022. I fall under this category and I would like to know how I can go about losing at least 10kgs in the coming months.



Dear reader,

The findings in the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey found that the incidence of obesity increases as one grows older, and the rates are higher in women living in urban areas and those who are educated beyond secondary school. There are many factors that could be contributing to these findings including increased consumption of processed carbohydrates and sugary foods/drinks and reduced physical activity. Other contributory factors include diet, age, environment, genetics, sleep and medications.

Weight management is important as either extremes of weight have associated health risks. Overweight and obesity increase the risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular illnesses, musculoskeletal problems, fertility concerns among others. Healthy living includes all components of a healthy lifestyle like regular physical exercise; healthy and balanced meals and feeding habits; taking adequate amounts of water; getting enough sleep; stress management; and healthy lifestyle choices, in addition to weight management. Overweight and obesity can be assessed using any of these:

i) Body mass index (BMI) derived by diving the weight in kilogrammes by the height in metres squared (kg/m2)

ii) Waist circumference

iii) Waist-to-hip ratio

iv) Skin fold thickness

v) Bioelectrical impedance

If you are overweight or obese, it is advisable to adopt a health plan that allows for gradual weight loss of about 0.5 to 1kg per week and that is sustainable over the long haul. It begins with setting a realistic goal and committing to it, and getting advice and support from reliable sources. Visit a nutritionist for healthy meal planning. For most individuals, weight loss requires having a calorie deficit, meaning that the calories consumed are less than the calories used up in the day’s activities and they can lose weight just by changing how much, how frequently and what they eat. The diet should have less refined starches and sugars and be rich in complex starches, proteins, vegetables, fruits, cereals, and fibre. In addition, it is beneficial to increase the amount of physical exercise to include at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week, and to take adequate water. Getting enough sleep also helps in the weight loss journey as poor sleep is a risk factor for adding weight. Quick weight loss diets, medications and cleanses are unhealthy and unsustainable, and skipping meals is also not advisable as it can lead to health problems and may even make the problem worse because of snacking or overeating due to the hunger.



Dr Flo,

I recently moved to another county and for the past one week, I have not passed stool despite eating a balanced diet. Is this normal?



Dear reader,

The inability to pass stools regularly or being unable to pass stools completely is called constipation. It may also cause the stools to be hard, unusually small or large or lumpy. It can happen due to a change in your eating habits and/or your routine. For some people, a new environment, new people and new toilets may psychologically make them uncomfortable enough that they are not able to open bowels regularly.

However, most of the time, constipation is due to lack of or inadequate fibre in diet, inadequate water intake and reduced or lack of physical activity. Other possible causes include some illnesses and medications.

To manage it, take a high fibre diet, plenty of water and increase the level of your physical activity. In addition, give yourself adequate time and privacy to pass stool. It may be beneficial to place your feet on a small stool as you sit on the toilet or use a squat toilet.

In case the problem persists beyond two weeks, or if there is abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss or rectal bleeding, then you need to be reviewed by a doctor. Any necessary tests will be done, and may include stool tests, abdominal x-ray and/or ultrasound scans amongst others. There are medications to make it easier to pass stools and relieve any peri-anal discomfort. If there is any underlying illness, it will be treated.



Last month I got my periods twice. I have not had them so far this month. What could be wrong with me?

Monica



Dear Monica,

The menstrual cycle normally lasts between 21 and 42 days, and the average is 28 days. If your cycle is normally shorter than 30 days, then this means that it is possible to have periods twice in one month. However, the menstrual cycle can be affected by hormonal changes, for example due to use of hormonal contraceptives and other hormonal medications, or pregnancy. Other possible causes of menstrual cycle changes include illness, environmental changes, stress, fasting or severe diets or eating disorders. When the period is early or late by a few days, or has any mild changes, then there is no cause to worry. However, if the changes occur regularly, or if they are significant, then it is advisable for you to be reviewed by a gynaecologist to check for any underlying disorders and for treatment of the same.

"Hadzabe, the Tanzanian tribe where women call the shots","Tap! Tap! Tap! A brown antelope calf hops across a smooth graded Karatu-Mang'ola road in Oldeani, a cool area in northern Tanzania covered in maize, sunflower, beans and coffee plantations.

Past Oldeani, it gets hot and windy. It's dusty too. As we get closer, we notice bushes, shrubs and indigenous trees scattered all over.  We are headed to meet the Hadzabe in the depths of forests of Yaeda Valley near Lake Eyasi in the Arusha region.

This hunter-gatherer community has also settled in Serengeti Plateau, on the side of Meatu District in the Simiyu region. The plateau borders Kenya. Others are spread across the forests of Mbulu and Kiteto districts in the Manyara region.

A section of Sonai settlement on June 2, 2023.

The Hadzabe are among about 130 ethnic groups in Tanzania. They are known by different variations—Hadzabi, Hadzane, Hadzape, Hadzapi, Hatsa and Watindiga. In the Kilimanjaro region, for instance, they are known as Watindiga. In Mtwara, they call them Wazabi.

Though Tanzania’s 2022 Census has not provided their population estimates, the United Nations says their numbers range from 1,300 to 1,500, a handful of the 61.7 million Tanzanians.

Endeko Endeko, a member of this community, is helping us locate his people who have settled in the Melekaa area.

There are no roads or signage here to give a sense of direction.

Slight change

Some progress though, the Hadzabe now own mobile phones, which they buy with the money visitors donate to them, or from their beadwork proceeds. The phone signal is, however, poor here.

A display of ornaments the Hadzabe sell to visitors at Sonai settlement, on June 2, 2023.

We access Melekaa from Mang’ola trading centre, a remote business area with only one hotel and a few shops. After diverting onto a bumpy road described as “hiyo barabara ya kwenda kwa wa Hadzabe (that road leading to the Hadzabe),” we manoeuvre through the rocks and shrubs.

We finally arrive at the foot of a huge baobab tree with a cave on its trunk. Before it, is a dusty open field surrounded by more baobabs and shrubs. On the right is a hillock of intimidating boulders resting on each other, forming a somewhat fortification for the community.

Shortly, a man in shorts and a brown sleeveless shirt walks down. Over his shoulder is a beaded skin. His foot is covered with grey tyre sandals and a knife is strapped to his shorts. He holds an arrow. This is Mambosi Jioja, the chairperson of the Sonai Hadzabe group.

The Hadzabe are communal, have a nomadic lifestyle and depend on game meat and wild fruits. For the last 30 years, however, they have never moved from here, Mambosi says. They live behind the hillock. Mambosi leads us up.

Mambosi Jioja inside a cave under a baobab tree trunk on June 2, 2023. He is the chairperson of the Hadzabe group.

As we crawl up, my heart freezes. A slide backward means an early visit to my ancestors. Furthermore, background research informed me that tiger and bark snakes are common here. I wonder if some are lurking under the rocks.

Mambosi is agile. I can't keep up with him. For a few seconds, I stand to catch a breath amid a whiff of nutty-burnt tyre air.

I ask him if a snake has stung anyone in the recent past. His response in the negative is consoling. He says they only bite if provoked. The Hadzabe don't eat snakes as many presume, Mambosi says.

We finally arrive in Sonai, where about 180 Hadzabe have settled in 35 brandy dome huts.

On a log under a towering baobab tree are men crafting sticks with knives to make arrows. A few yards behind them are women sitting on the ground watching over their merchandise lined up on makeshift display structures under the baobab tree.

Necklaces, bangles, earrings, headbands and ornamental gourds hang from the branches and hangers made from cactus, fixed on the tree. I later discover that this baobab tree, in the middle of the settlement, is a landmark serving as a special meeting point for the community.

I greet the men: “Hamjambo? (How are you?).”

I receive a rude response; they just smile and continue sharpening their arrows.

Although this community mainly speaks their native language Hadzabe, their Swahili is fluent. So they heard me. But apparently, I have broken their greeting code.

Mambosi shows me what I am expected to do. Their greeting is special. I shake their hand and say 'mtana' for hello. But the mtana is escorted with some kind of Maasai dance in the form of a rhythmic combination of sounds of kissing, clicking and mumbling like mwaah, knah, mmm, mtana!

Having mastered the art, it becomes easier to greet the women. I request to speak with the women and Katarina Hassan quickly takes the wings.

She welcomes me to her low-height hut built from branches and leaves of indigenous trees. It’s also covered with cream tarpaulin, white sack and canvas, materials left behind by visitors. It has no window—only a door of a coloured shawl.We sit down on a hide of a buffalo, covered with a coloured leso.

“What are the roles of a man and woman in your community?” I ask her.

“His work is to hunt and bring home honey for the family,” she explains. “A woman is to dig up roots and tubers and collect wild fruits.”

The environment has open patches, a clear sign of lost flora to accommodate fauna, their source of livelihood. The changing times has, however, not shifted the community’s expectations as is the case for modern society where women assume roles previously restricted to men.

“Our roles still stand. I can’t go hunting. Neither can he go collecting fruits or tubers; that is my work. That is how it is. That’s a culture passed down to us,” she reckons.

Katarina Hassan digs out a tuber on June 2, 2023.

They have, however, defied the kind of food they eat. She says the harsh weather conditions and conversion of parts of the forest to farms have disturbed the area's ecology, resulting in dwindled production and presence of their wild food.The wild animals they hunted—antelopes, wildebeests, baboons, dik-dik, buffaloes and zebras—have gone missing.

Special status

According to the UN, the Hadzabe are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer communities on Earth. In Tanzania, it is the only community allowed to source its food through hunting and gathering, says Zakaria Faustin, executive director of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum.

He says Tanzania’s first President Mwalimu Nyerere issued a decree recognising and protecting the community’s special status. The order stands, he says.

But the changing ecosystem threatens their special status. “Whenever they (animals) want to come here, they hear meee, mooo, owh, ting, ting and they run away,” Maliseli Sadiki, a young man who says he is 22, illustrates their frustration with the disappearance of the wild animals.

“These days, you walk for long until you get tired and hunger pangs and thirst overwhelm you. So, you’re forced to excavate tubers to eat. They are succulent and quench your thirst,” says Maliseli, whose dressing is like a billboard of the animals they hunt.

Katarina Hassan holds a tuber on June 2, 2023.

Hanging over his faded black T-shirt and blue knee denim short, are skins and hides of antelope, wildebeest, baboons, dik-dik, buffalo and zebra.

The community has embraced other food. “We eat rice and ugali with vegetables,” says Katarina.

“Usually, visitors bring us maize flour, rice, indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and cooking oil. If anyone gifts us with money, we use it to buy food and distribute it among ourselves.”

Togetherness

Here, nearly everything is done communally. It is the community chairperson who receives any gift on their behalf, including money and food, then he shares it out.

If it’s food, it has to be adequate enough to feed all of them. If it’s water, sourced from a borehole miles away, the money ought to be enough to buy at least one jerrycan of 20 litres for each household at Tsh1,000 (Ksh57.58).

True to Katarina’s submission, during my short time with the community, some foreign tourists gift them with maize flour, assorted indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and some money to buy cooking oil. Mambosi leads the distribution from the baobab tree, the special meeting point.

The women stretch their hands to receive the food. But there is something unique about this whole exercise.

I have witnessed food distribution exercises in Kenya’s Turkana, Baringo and Narok counties and I have never seen a man run to the house to bring a sack to the wife to collect the food. Maybe, I have not been that keen.

Gender power balance is so obvious here. In a generation where UN Women keeps calling for redistribution of household responsibilities, how this community does it is intriguing.

I ask Katarina about the power relations between men and women in their community. “Sisi ni wakali sana kwa wanaume. Sisi ndio tuna uamuzi. Uamuzi ndio wa kwetu. Tukiamua hii, sisi wanawake tumeamua, tusipoamua basi tunaacha (We are more powerful than men. We are the decision-makers and when we decide, our decision is final),” she says.

The power is rooted in marriage culture. Unlike in most cultures across the world where a woman moves into the man’s home once they marry, here, it is the opposite.

“Well, a man woos the woman but she only marries him if he accepts her terms and conditions,” explains Katarina.

“Once he accepts, she builds her house with the support of her mother and other women. The man then joins her. It is her house. Not the man’s,” she says.

The women also determine how much should be paid as reverse dowry. Years ago, they had to bring not less than three baboons, rolls of tobacco and honey, Katarina says.

A section of Sonai settlement.

But these days, due to scarcity of the wild animals, they are allowed to pay in many necklaces, as preferred by the women, and honey.

“The young man will make efforts to find honey, tobacco and necklaces,” explains Mambosi, the Sonai settlement’s chairperson. “The bride’s mother and sister to the groom will only welcome them into the house after the man has fulfilled all the dowry requirements.”

While the women help the bride to construct the house for the incoming husband, the men prepare the groom for his household responsibilities by giving him a honey bag, a skin or hide, knife and arrows, Mambosi says.

So in the case of divorce, the man only leaves with what he came with. That is his only possession. “The children belong to the women. They may have his surname, but it is the women who call the shots,” insists Katarina.

Apalii Saitoti Thufu, Katarina’s husband, proudly acknowledges the power of women here. “If she tells you to leave, you’ll leave. If she allows you to leave with the children then fine,” he says.

In jest, I interject: “But you can refuse to leave.”

He quickly counters: “How can you refuse to go, yet the house is hers. Even if you were to go with the children, where would you host them when you don’t have a house?”

“Is there a problem building a house for yourself and the children?” I ask.

He responds: “No, no! It’s not in our tradition for a man to build a house. That’s the work of women. If she chases you away, you return to your parents. And you’ll just sleep in the open or create some sort of a structure to sleep under.”

Apalii says he was born in Ghorofani, another settlement in Karatu District and moved to Sonai where his wife built a house. Together, they have two children.

I ask Katarina the main reason why women chase away the men and she says: “Kama nimechoka kuchimba mizizi si nitakuwa mkali? (How can I not be rattled if I am bogged down with excavating roots?)”

Maliseli is a victim. He was born here but had a wife in Endamaka, another settlement in Karatu district. They had two children.

But he says he recently returned to his parents, after disagreeing with his wife. She remained with the children. He says he hasn’t seen the children since he left, but given the chance, he can visit them.

He struggled to respond to the query of where he lives. “Mimi naishi kama mimi, kama mimi, kama mimi (As for me, I, I, I live).”

Unlike in many parts of Tanzania and Kenya, where female genital mutilation and child marriages are prevalent, among the Hadzabe, such harmful practices are zero. They are detested. However, girls go through a rite of passage.

A Hadzabe. Girls wear headbands once they begin menstruating.

“If a girl taints her clothes, we will know she has started her menses,” explains Mindi Saitoti, “or if she doesn’t know what’s happening, she will ask her mother.""

""The same day she makes the report, the women contribute beaded necklaces and a headband to decorate her. That shows she is mature.

""But it doesn’t mean she is ready for marriage. If a man intends to marry her, her mother must approve of it and they never do so unless she is above 18 years,” she says.

Mindi is married and has three children. She and her husband, Tabashi Chalesi, were born here. She built a house a few yards away from her parents’ and they live happily.

I am curious to find out if Tabashi finds it strange to live near his in-laws. But it sounds like a weird question.“Strange, how?” he asks.

“We are okay. What is the problem with that?”

I rest my case. Meanwhile, the men have their own way of telling when a woman is ready for marriage.

“You look at the chest. If the breasts are sagging and she has a necklace, you will know she is suitable for marriage,” says Mambosi.

Education

Although the Tanzanian government has made efforts to take its children to school, the Hadzabe who get an education still return to the forest to continue with their cultural lifestyle.

The case of Endeko. He got his secondary education in 2015 and later a diploma in governance and development through a scholarship.

But currently, he lives in his home in Yaeda Chini in Mbulu District in the Manyara region. He says forest life is less stressful.

Zakaria of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum describes the process of modernising the Hadzabe as complicated.“You help them get higher education but they still prefer to go back to the forests,” he notes.

His organisation has previously attempted to help them embrace sustainable means of livelihood but it ended in futility.

“In 2007, we supported them with goats so that they can shift from hunting to keeping goats. But during the dry season, they returned home, shot the goats and ate them,” he says.

My three-day trek in wilderness to escape abusive marriage,"Having been betrothed to a stranger husband at the age of 11 through an arranged marriage, Evelyn Kiyeny had endured occasional battering that left her weak, at times seeking treatment from health facilities.

The beating is a form of discipline reserved for women who dare defy instructions from their husbands in the patriarchal pastoral society.

The battery became worse after every child birth, when the husband would stagger home drunk, demand for food and if not ready, it translated to an instant battering. It persisted till her fifth child was born.

Unable to bear it any more, she decided to run away from her matrimonial home, but the estranged husband followed her.

“My former husband tried to convince my father that I should go back to his homestead since he had paid the dowry in full. I remained defiant and one day, he came in the company of 11 other men. They pulled me out of the house, took me to a bush and whipped me in turns until I blacked out,” recalls 29-year-old Ms Kiyeny.

Inner voice

She says after the beatings she was unconscious for a while and when she recovered, the men who had retreated some few metres away. Thinking she was dead, they came over, carried her and dumped her at a local health facility at Nginyang Township before disappearing without uttering a word to the medics.

Ms Kiyeny says while at the hospital, she heard an inner voice warning of an imminent danger and commanding her to get out of the health facility and run for safety.

“The only place I knew I had a relative was in Tangulbei Township. Though it was a long distance from our home in Nginyang, I opted to endure the hardships. I slept in the bush hungry but was lucky, the following day, to be offered shelter by a Good Samaritan,” she explains through an interpreter since she has never stepped in a classroom.

For three days, she trekked through the wilderness of Baringo County to escape from an abusive marriage she had persevered for 15 years.

She was literally running away from death, having a few days earlier experienced a severe beating by 12 men who left her half dead.

On arriving at her relative’s place, hungry, sickly and exhausted, she was taken to hospital where she was admitted for a week.

Through support from a women network, which has more than 2,800 members spread across Tiaty East Sub-county, she has managed to pick up the pieces, reunited with her children and now operates a grocery shop at Tangulbei Township.

The Action Aid project has helped her gain economic empowerment and is aware of her rights. She is actively involved in campaign on women rights through Village Savings and Lending Association (VSLA) groups where women meet weekly for a community savings and lending scheme.

Many women and girls in her Pokot community remain victims of the deep-rooted culture that subject them to inhuman treatment.

Many have been rescued from forced marriage by the women network.

“We desperately need a rescue centre in each of the six sub-counties in Baringo if the fight against retrogressive cultural practice that adversely affect the lives of Pokot girls has to be won,” says Ms Charity Lemejan, the vice secretary to Tangulbei Women Network.

Hostile and violent

“Girls are being abused day in day out. We have few children protection officers in the county with one serving three expansive sub-counties. At times, rescue missions abort since the community turns hostile and violent,” says Irene Chepkoi, a children officer based at Kabarnet Town.

The county also lacks enough charitable children institutions where rescued girls can be housed for safety, care and access education.

Ms Chepkoi says they are collaborating with other stakeholders to train child protection volunteers who can sensitise community at the villages and also report cases of child abuse.

“We have been supported by Action Aid to train volunteers based at the villages to educate the community and monitor cases of child abuse, since women who should be vocal about this vice, still believe it’s acceptable. Another approach we are using is reaching out to the community through community radio stations to educate the public on the rights of a child and how he or she can be protected,” she explains.

Ending GBV starts with teaching boys and girls about consent,"The fight against sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) can be won with proper upbringing of girls and boys, gender equality advocates say.

Miss Universe, 2019 and gender equality advocate Ms Zozibini Tunzi said normalising violence during childhood permeates into adulthood when it becomes worse.

“When you have pre-school boy and girl playing and the boy beats up the girl, the first thing that people say is ‘don’t worry. Oh he likes her?’” she said during a December 4, Fighting a Shadow Pandemic webinar convened by Foreign Policy.

“This is where it (violence against women and girls) begins. You are subconsciously teaching this young boy that love is violence. You are also teaching this young girl that to be loved is to be violated,” she added.

She said, boys and girls should be nurtured into understanding principles of gender equality. With the knowledge, the boys will respect and value the rights of girls and vice versa, she said.

“Start teaching girls and boys about consent (and) boundaries. We have to start today creating an army of men that we want to see in future,” she said.

Comprehensive data lacking

UN Women representative in South Africa, Ms Anne Githuku-Shongwe, identified lack of comprehensive data as a critical barrier to tackling SGBV.

“One of the challenges we have with data is the fact that less than 40 per cent of women report violence (and yet they are the main sources of data),” she said.

“We tend not to know what is really happening in terms of violence from country to country unless there is a full national prevalence survey,” she added.

In South Africa, she said, femicide stands at 12.5 deaths per 100,000 women which has earned its identities such as murder or rape capital of the world.

Globally, 137 women are killed every day with 50 per cent of murders committed by intimate partners thus implying that homes are not safe for women, she said.

Black Women Caucus, founder and chairperson, Ms Fatimata Moutloatse said rise in student movements has revolutionised anti-SGBV campaigns to bring to attention sexual harassment in higher learning institutions previously under the wrap.

Their activism in South Africa, for instance, catapulted President Cyril Ramaphosa into action against SGBV.

Understanding low blood pressure,"Dear doctor,

These days there is a lot of talk on high blood pressure and healthy lifestyles. Sometimes my blood pressure is high and sometimes its normal. My question is, is it better to have low blood pressure? Is there a way to get rid of it completely?

Richard



Dear Richard,

The blood pressure reading is a measure of the force at which your heart is pumping blood and the resistance to the blood flow within the blood vessels. These two measures give the two figures we use for blood pressure reading. Normal blood pressure is between 90/60mmhg and 140/90mmhg. Anything above 140/90mmhg is considered high blood pressure.

Normally, the lower the blood pressure the better, though a reading below 90/60mmhg is considered low blood pressure or hypotension. When hypotension is mild and there are no symptoms, then there’s usually no cause for concern. However, if there is reduced blood supply to the brain and other organs, then symptoms such as dizziness, fainting attacks, feeling tired, headache, neck pain, confusion, blurred vision and abnormal heart beat develop. When severe, it can lead to shock and even death. Symptomatic low blood pressure requires interventions, which may include medical treatments and lifestyle changes like taking more water and increasing sodium intake under medical guidance.

In a few people, about five to 10 per cent of those with high blood pressure, there is an exact cause for it such as kidney disease, hormonal disorders, pregnancy, anaemia, tumours, drugs or some medications. For these people, once the cause has been identified and dealt with, then the blood pressure can be sorted out.

In majority of the people, about 90 to 95 per cent of those with high blood pressure, there is no known cause why the pressure goes up. It goes higher with age and by the time it is being said to be high, it has been rising slowly over many years, and continues to do so. There are some things that are associated with this rise such as age (being over 40), being male, being African, having a close relative with high blood pressure, high-salt intake, high-calorie, high-fat diet; lack of exercise, obesity, taking too much alcohol, smoking and stressful lifestyle. Because the blood pressure rises over many years, it is not possible to cure it with medication taken for a short time. This is because the changes in the vascular system are not reversible.

Unfortunately, most of the time you cannot tell that your blood pressure is high unless it is measured. Therefore, you may be feeling fine, but the blood pressure is high and it continues to cause damage to the blood vessels and can cause stroke, heart disease, kidney failure and even loss of vision. To prevent these long term effects, you are put on medication to lower the blood pressure to normal levels. If the pressure readings are normal, then the medicine is working. If you stop taking the medicine, the blood pressure goes back up, which is why it is very important for you to keep taking the medicine.

In addition to that, reduce the amount of salt (sodium),  fat and starch in your diet to healthy levels, reduce alcohol intake, stop smoking, reduce weight to healthy levels, exercise, take a potassium-rich diet with lots of vegetables and fruits (avoid potassium supplements), have enough sleep and manage stress.

When the blood pressure readings are between 120 to 140mmhg systolic and 80 to 90mmhg diastolic, what is considered as pre=hypertension or high-normal pressure, the lifestyle changes can help delay or prevent development of high blood pressure. Additionally, if you are diagnosed to have high blood pressure stage 1 (systolic 140 to 159mmhg and diastolic 90-99mmhg), you may be advised to do lifestyle modification for six months while being monitored for lowering of blood pressure before being started on medication.  It is advisable for you to check your blood pressure and visit the physician regularly for monitoring, early intervention and to avoid complications related to blood pressure abnormalities.



I am 43 years old and I have been trying to get pregnant for some time. Can folic acid help improve my fertility? Phyllis



Dear Phyllis,

Folic acid is useful for different functions in the body, especially the formation of red blood cells. Folic acid/folate supplements (a form of vitamin B9) help to build up the folate stores in the body so that you have enough to “share” with the forming baby during pregnancy, and this is important to prevent development of disorders of the brain and spine (neural tube disorders). Because of this, it is advisable to start taking them once you intend to get pregnant so that once you conceive, the body already has enough stores, and to continue taking the folic acid supplements at least for the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy. The folic acid supplements, however, do not increase fertility.

For women, the highest number of eggs one will ever have are the ones present at birth and they decline over time. The “peak” fertile period is between the late teens and the 20s. After 30, fertility starts to drop, and this drop is most significant from around age 35. From age 40, the possibility of achieving a pregnancy is about 5-10 per cent with each cycle. This means that it is possible to get pregnant in your 40s, but it may take a bit longer. The other challenges with getting pregnant in your 40s is that there is a higher chance of abnormalities for the baby and a higher risk of complications during pregnancy.

The other possible causes of reduced fertility include abnormal ovarian function, hormonal disorders, fallopian tube obstruction and abnormalities of the uterus.

It is advisable for any woman above 40 planning a pregnancy to see a gynaecologist from before conception, and from very early in the pregnancy. In the case of delayed conception, the gynaecologist review can help isolate the exact problem and chart a course of management since different causes of reduced fertility have different treatments.

John-Allan Namu's letter to 24-year-old self,"

Award winning journalist, John-Allan Namu, talks about how the conflicts he experienced in his 20s lead him to be more intentional and compassionate in his personal and professional life.

Media personality John Allan Namu has opened up about life in his 20’s, and the lessons that shaped who he is now.

Speaking to content creator Wabosha Maxine, Namu explained: “I was always looking for someone in the ""it"" crowd mainly because of my own imposter syndrome. I felt that I was not enough on my own so I needed someone who was whole so that that fairy dust can just sprinkle itself on me. I wanted someone whose attention was on me so that I could dote on her, that was the kind of person I was looking for at the time.""

On his journey to discovery, Namu realised his idea of a relationship is as flimsy as  a house of cards with no semblance of a foundation. This is after he met his wife Makena.

""She is extremely attractive, very outgoing, very curious about the world, never afraid to ask the question that will get the conversation going and get you to learn,"" Namu said.

This has made him come up with what he calls the Makena posture.

""I will not act like I know everything, I will go and ask everything,"" he noted.

The media personality goes ahead to explain what unique 'X factor' his wife has that his exes did not.

Little angel gone too soon,"Lena* lay on her back, spent. She was barely conscious but she kept mumbling about her baby. She wanted to know why she could not hear her baby cry. However, she was so tired, her voice was barely audible. No one gave her an answer. They were focused on the baby.

The midwife finally cleaned Lena up and transferred her to the postnatal ward. Lena was exhausted. She gratefully sank into a deep sleep. She had been in labour for over 24 hours, with neither sleep nor nourishment.

With the introduction of the free maternity care under the Linda Mama benefits scheme in Kenya, many small private facilities signed up with the National Hospital Insurance Fund, now renamed National Health Insurance Fund, as service providers. However, the manner in which the fund was structured did not address certain important aspects.

For facilities to claim reimbursement for services rendered, they had to present evidence of the actual delivery. This means that if the facility monitored the patient for seven hours and the patient developed complications that required that the patient be referred for more specialised delivery services, the referring facility was not reimbursed for costs thus far.

This unfortunate oversight resulted in patients being held in facilities with the hope that they will deliver, causing unwarranted delays and unfortunate outcomes for the mother and baby. This was the case for Lena. She was kept at a level three private maternity home for 24 hours before she was referred to the level four public facility. Eventually, the prolonged labour resulted in severe consequences for her baby. Lena was dehydrated and exhausted by the time she arrived at the public hospital. The maternity team quickly initiated resuscitation and prepared Lena for caesarian section. She was transferred to the operating room but before surgery commenced, she was able to deliver vaginally, with assistance, using special equipment. But the baby was not so lucky.

The little one was unable to breathe well after delivery, having suffered birth asphyxia. During this prolonged duration of labour, baby was not able to get sufficient oxygen through the placenta and umbilical cord. This resulted in injury to the baby’s brain cells due to insufficient oxygenation.

Lena’s baby had to be transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit at the national referral facility. It means that Lena’s sleep had to be interrupted and she joined her baby in the ambulance.

It was tough 10 days while Lena watched her baby on a ventilator. Baby fought hard for her life but it wasn’t easy. The dominos began to fall. First it was the convulsions that would not let up, further aggravating her brain injury. She had to be put on anticonvulsants. Just when the neonatologists thought they had things under control, next came infection. Her antibiotics had to be switched to stronger ones. This was quickly followed by kidney failure. At a measly 3200g, she had to start on dialysis. Her body was struggling to balance the salt levels.

Lena cried so long, she had no more tears left. She would sit for hours at her baby’s bedside. Her mother sat with her all day and left in the evening. She tried to convince Lena to eat but it was in vain. She would take a few sips of uji throughout the day as her daily sustenance. She was ready to be a single mother after her partner succumbed to Covid-19 before Lena even knew she was pregnant, but she did not envisage starting out this way. On the fifth day, the doctors thought the baby was looking better. Her blood tests showed that the infection was coming under control and the convulsions were few and far apart. She had even started making a few drops of urine. This great progress lasted all of three days before things truly fell apart. The convulsions increased in frequency despite treatment and a new wave of infection (neonatal sepsis) set in. For the next 48 hours, it was all touch and go. Lena was besides herself with anguish. Her mother camped at the hospital all night with Lena until morning when the doctors concluded that there wasn’t anything else that could be done for her.

After a spirited fight for 10 days, baby finally let go. Lena only got to hold her daughter for the first time in death. She never suckled her baby, never changed a diaper, never gave her a bath, never got to dress her in the cute little clothes she had bought.

Her baby joined painful statistic of 21 deaths per 1,000 babies born alive, who lose their lives within the first 28 days of being born. This figure remains way too high despite having come down by a third over the past two decades. Even worse is that out of all children losing their lives before their fifth birthday, half of these deaths happen before they see their first month of life.

It is inevitable that there are babies we will lose in this period immediately after birth as a result of unpreventable complications such as congenital abnormalities that are incompatible with life, extreme prematurity and genetic abnormalities. However, the larger proportion of deaths is preventable and we must strive to avoid them. The race to save a life already compromised is one we do not easily win and one that costs thousands of shillings.

It is not enough that maternity and perinatal care is free to the mother. We must ensure that the care provided is of good quality and that the entire system of service delivery works properly. Financing maternity and perinatal care must be thought through to ensure appropriate, safe and efficient delivery of care without gaps that compromise these tenets and become a threat to life.

It is time we dried Lena’s tears; no newborn baby should die of preventable death!

Step up efforts to end preventable deaths of newborns.

Help! My wife blames me for her recurrent urinary tract infections,"Dear Doc,

My wife has been having recurrent urinary tract infections and surprisingly she blames me and accuses me of being unfaithful. Are UTIs sexually transmitted? And if not, what could be causing my wife this problem?

Kevo, Eldoret



Dear Kevo,

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are infections within the urinary tract, that is, either in the kidney, ureter, bladder or urethra. UTIs are quite common in women and in about 20 per cent of all women, the UTIs are recurrent — they keep coming back. Some people may have recurrent UTIs for no good reason, while in others, it may be due to abnormalities in the structures of the urinary system, or it may be due to pregnancy, steroid use, spinal cord injury, nerve problems, kidney stones or some immune disorders.

In most cases, the bacteria that cause UTIs are the ones that live in the intestines, and they can travel from the anus to the urethral opening (where urine comes out), since the two are not far from each other. Women also have a very short urethra (the tube that carries urine to the outside) compared to men, which makes it easier for bacteria to travel up to the bladder and cause infection there. The bacteria can also get to the urethra when using a dirty toilet due to splashing, and also due to the close contact during sexual intercourse. In addition to this, when there is a sexually transmitted infection, it can cause infection within the reproductive structures and also within the urinary system. Regardless of whether it originated from an STI or not, having multiple partners increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and breeds an environment of mistrust that can destroy a relationship.

Having a UTI may cause a burning or irritating sensation when passing urine, feeling very pressed, urine leaking out before getting to the toilet, going to urinate many times, even though very little urine comes out; change in urine colour and/or smell, blood in urine, lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, fever and chills, nausea, bloating and feeling tired.

It is important to note that someone can have UTI-like symptoms that are caused by inflammation of the urinary bladder (cystitis) due to other causes other than infection. These include some medications, radiation, other chronic illnesses and interstitial cystitis. UTIs are treated with antibiotics after a urine test. Due to the recurrence, she should also have a urine culture done. She may also benefit from a vaginal swab for analysis and culture. For recurrent UTIs, she may be given a low dose antibiotic to take over a long time. She may also be advised to take an antibiotic every time after sexual intercourse or take antibiotics for a short time (one or two days) every time she gets symptoms. She can also learn how to do a urine test at home every time she gets symptoms to make sure that it is a urine infection.  To prevent urinary tract infections, she can do this:

Go to the toilet as soon as she needs to and empty the bladder completely

Always use a clean toilet

Take a lot of water daily, not just when there’s an infection

Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting trousers

Avoid using scented soaps, feminine hygiene products and douches

Wipe herself from front to back

Both of you should clean the genital area thoroughly before sexual intercourse and urinate immediately after

Barrier contraceptive methods such as condoms, diaphragms and spermicides can cause irritation, so consider using another method. When using a condom, make sure you use a good lubricant.



I sexual intercourse with this lady a month ago and now she says she’s pregnant. I doubt it is mine since we used protection and besides that, I found out that the pregnancy is four weeks and a few days old. How do I get DNA done before that child is born?

K, Nairobi



Dear K,

In the first place,  it is possible for a pregnancy to occur even when you have used a barrier method/protection such as  a condom. This may be due to contact with pre-ejaculate fluid if the condom was not used throughout the encounter. The other reasons for this would be rupture of the condom or spillage during withdrawal/removal. It is possible to do paternity DNA testing during pregnancy by isolating the baby’s DNA from the mother’s blood between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. If the result is inconclusive, it needs to be confirmed by using amniotic fluid or chorionic villus sampling, where a sample is taken from the tissues surrounding the growing fetus. These procedures are invasive and may trigger a miscarriage so it is best to wait for the baby to be born. For any of these tests, you need the consent of the mother and the possible father(s) and you may require legal consent, and the tests require a complex medical procedure.

In regards to the reported age of the pregnancy, medical practitioners count the age of a pregnancy from the day the last periods started, not from the day someone got pregnant. For example, if someone got pregnant four weeks ago and they had their periods two weeks before that, the pregnancy is said to be six weeks old. This counting system, however, is not exact, so you cannot determine paternity definitively based on that.



What does the word genetic mean? Is it different from generic drugs?

Ali



Genetics refers to the biological make-up of an individual based on the genes they have. Genes are units of biological material found in our cells that “dictate” how our body develops and different traits that we get. We get a set of genes from each of our parents, which means that traits are passed down from our parents to us such as skin colour, hair colour, eye colour and blood type. Genes could also carry traits that cause disease or that make it easier for someone to get a particular disease, for example hypertension, diabetes, sickle cell disease, some cancers, some psychiatric disorders, among others. This means that there are some diseases that we are at higher risk of developing if our parents or other close relatives also had them.

The active ingredient in a drug is known as the generic name of that drug. This is different from the brand name, which is the name given to that drug by a specific company. For example, the active ingredient chlorpheniramine (generic name) is known by the brand name piriton, allergy relief, Nyquil, Chlorphen ...

Another use of the term generic is in reference to medication that is made to be similar to the original medicine that was developed by a specific company. This generic medication is similar to the original medication, but is usually cheaper since the company that developed the original molecule had to bear the cost of developing the drug, taking it through research and drug trials and seek approval from the relevant authorities.

The World Rally Championship drew both positive and negative headlines. The event that has been a major tourist attraction for eons and this year was no different. From President Ruto experiencing the thrill in a rally car, to Kenyans traveling from all over to witness a historic event.

However rally enthusiasts fear that the highs of the WRC may be hitting a low. Kenyan drivers were discriminated during the award ceremony in what has now been termed by KOT as racism.

When menopause comes too early,"Ayeema* sat forlornly across from me, biting her nails, a habit she had refused to drop since childhood. She was nervous but pretending to be all right. I had known Ayeema since she was born. This is one habit her mum had lost the fight on.

Ayeema’s mother, Hawa*, sat next to Ayeema and literally took over the conversation. This was the Hawa I grew up knowing; she hadn’t changed a bit! Hawa would speak on behalf of everyone, like the predestined spokesperson, even when she had no business talking.

Today, however, she was just a worried mother. Ayeema had not had periods for a whole year. Though Ayeema did not seem to mind her situation, Hawa made it her business to seek help. Ayeema started her period when she was 15. For the next decade, she had a fairly normal flow but at 25, her periods became lighter and irregular until they altogether disappeared. It had been over a year since she had last bled. What got mum concerned was when Ayeema started manifesting symptoms that were all too familiar.

Hawa was going through menopause, with the classical symptoms of hot flashes, poor sleep patterns, change in appetite, anxiety and mood swings. She was quite startled to find the same symptoms, albeit a little subdued, in Ayeema. She was worried. She wanted to see her grandchildren before she died.

Ayeema noted that her periods had never been remarkable. They came a little later than most of her peers but she had always been a tiny one, so she thought it was expected. The longest she ever bled was three days, but most times she would have periods for a day or two. The periods were light and she only got mild period pains.

Three years back, she noted the periods becoming irregular. She would get a period every two to three months, which progressed to just twice in the year and then ceased completely for almost a year now.

A thorough examination revealed that Ayeema’s adolescent transition had taken  place appropriately, with normal breast development, normal body hair distribution a normal female habitus. She did not demonstrate any signs of other hormonal problems and save for her menses going on strike, she was otherwise in perfect health.

Medical tests done on Ayeema revealed that she did not have any chromosomal abnormalities. Her reproductive hormones were at menopausal levels. An ultrasound of her pelvis noted that her ovaries were present but abnormally small. Her uterus was quite small, the size of a pre-adolescent girl’s.

It was heartbreaking to inform Ayeema and Hawa of the diagnosis. Ayeema had suffered premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), or premature menopause as better described in simpler terms. If I thought Ayeema had taken the news hard, I hadn’t quite comprehended what this would do to Hawa.

Hawa went into denial. She quickly dragged Ayeema off to the United States where part of the family resided, for a second and third opinion. The upside was that Ayeema was further able to be screened for multiple possible causes of POI, which we hadn’t yet done as the sample specimen would require to be shipped abroad.

Thankfully all the screens for the rarer autoimmune disorders were negative. Having eliminated all known causes of POI, Ayeema joined the 70 per cent of women with the condition, categorised as idiopathic premature ovarian insufficiency. For these patients, the fact that there is no identifiable cause of the condition means that we are not able to modify its outcomes by treating the cause.

The first order of business was to confront Ayeema’s reality regarding her fertility. POI meant that she had a less than negligible possibility of conception as her ovaries had  no more viable eggs left. A few patients with POI, especially those whose POI is caused by autoimmune diseases, being able to tame the autoimmune disease may result in a slight improvement in ovarian function, which may result in a conception. Unfortunately for Ayeema, this was not the case. She would have to be content with the fact that she would never be able to sire her own biological children.  Aside from that, the early decline in the female reproductive hormones has a direct impact on multiple systems in the body. A decline in oestrogen levels directly results in osteoporosis. This is why elderly post-menopausal women make up the majority of patients with osteoporosis. This puts them at high risk of fractures, even from low-impact forces. For a person with POI, the risk sets in way too early, compromising the quality of life.

Further, their cardiovascular risk index disproportionately rises, putting them at risk of events such as stroke and heart attacks. As if that’s not enough, there is a marked impact on their cognitive function, resulting in earlier onset, more severe forms of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. The condition further predisposes to obesity, insulin resistance, and inappropriate cholesterol synthesis, increasing the risk for diabetes and high cholesterol levels.  Walking Ayeema through all these complications was important for her to understand the justification for proposing long-term hormone replacement therapy as part of her treatment plan. Further, she is more conscious of her lifestyle, making informed choices in order to keep undesired outcomes at bay.  Unfortunately, by virtue of being a practising Muslim, her religion does not permit the practice of using donor eggs for in-vitro fertilisation, hence the dream of ever becoming a mum is currently quashed.  Both Ayeema and Hawa were referred to a counselling psychologist.  It was important for Ayeema to go through the healing journey and accept herself.

It was even more important for Hawa to accept her daughter and be able to provide Ayeema with the necessary support.

Today, Ayeema finds fulfilment in the early childhood development center she opened a year ago. It allows her to experience children from a different perspective and find her joy. Hawa, well, she will always be Hawa! We love her as she is.

"Doc, do muscle cramps signal a more serious problem?","Doc,

Since a year ago, my hands intermittently jerk and twitch when I type for a long period. For instance, I will be typing a report and the moment I take a pause, my full hands quickly jerk straight up and then back down onto the keys. I don’t know if this matters, but I don’t consume alcohol or drugs. What could be the issue?



The jerking and twitching of the hand is due to involuntary muscle spasms. The sudden, brief contraction (and relaxation) of a muscle or group of muscles causing twitching or jerking is called myoclonus. A possible cause of this is muscle spasms triggered by strenuous activity. It can also be due to carpal tunnel syndrome, where one of the major nerves going to your hands is compressed near your wrist due to inflammation that may be triggered by repetitive hand motions, or as a result of pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and others. Carpal tunnel syndrome may also cause numbness, tingling of the fingers, weakness and pain that may shoot up the arm.

Dehydration and caffeine intake can also cause involuntary muscle spasms. Problems with the nervous system or the brain can also cause myoclonus.

Rest, hydration and avoiding caffeine can help reduce the occurrence of the muscle spasms that are triggered by these.

However, if the twitching is recurrent, it is advisable to be seen by a doctor for examination for any underlying problems and to institute appropriate management for the same.



Dear Doc,

My daughter is turning 16 years in a week’s time. However, she is yet to get her menstrual period. Every other 28 days, she experiences painful cramping but not the menstruation. Should I be worried?



Dear parent,

The beginning of menstruation is called menarche and it can occur between ages 10 and 16, though the average age is 12.4 years. The timing of menarche depends on a number of factors including genetics, nutritional status, general health, exercise levels and socioeconomic status. The first period usually occurs without warning and may be painless. Initially, the cycles occur without ovulation so they tend to be irregular in timing and amount/length of bleeding.

For menarche to happen, there should be normal hormonal systems, normal anatomy and good general health. When there are no periods, in the absence of pregnancy, this is called amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea means that there have never been any menses at all, while secondary amenorrhea is when there is absence of menses for three cycles or for six months in someone who was previously receiving their periods.

If a female has normal physical growth and normal secondary sexual development but has not had menarche by age 15, then this is primary amenorrhea. This can be due to genetic problems that affect the reproductive system or due to hormonal problems or a structural problem with the reproductive organs such as missing or underdeveloped organs, or having an imperforate hymen (a hymen that does not have a space to allow the menstrual blood to pass through).

It is advisable for her to be reviewed by a gynaecologist to establish the cause of the primary amenorrhea and appropriate intervention.





Dear doctor,

What are hemorrhoids?

Alnashir D Walji



Dear Alnashir,

Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are veins that swell or bulge out in the lower part of the rectum and anus. The walls of the veins become inflamed or irritated and stretch out, easily tearing and bleeding especially when passing stool. The hemorrhoids may be on the outside around the anal opening: these are called external hemorrhoids. Or they may be inside and “come out” when passing stoo, and sometimes can be pushed back in, which are called prolapsed hemorrhoids. If they are far up inside that they cannot be seen or felt, they are called internal hemorrhoids. Symptoms include a painful or itchy swelling at the anal opening and pain or bleeding when passing stool. If the blood within the prolapsed veins clots, this is a thrombosed hemorrhoid and it will be felt as a very painful hard lump.

About 75 per cent of all adults will develop hemorrhoids at one point in their lifetime. The cause may be unknown or they may be caused by straining when passing stool such as due to constipation or diarrhoea. They may also be caused by any activity that causes repeated high pressure in the abdominal region such as a persistent cough or lifting weights. They are also more common in people who stand or sit for long periods of time and also during pregnancy. Most of the time they resolve easily with diet and lifestyle changes and with treatment, though they can recur.

To prevent hemorhhoids and to manage them, prevent constipation through:

- adequate fluid intake

- taking a high fibre diet everyday

- regular exercise (150 minutes of moderate exercise per week)

When opening bowels, take your time and you can use a small stool to raise your legs while sitting on the toilet or use a squat toilet. Because the tissue around the anus is irritated or injured, you can use flushable baby wipes instead of toilet paper and you can also take a sitz bath: sit in warm water for about 20min twice a day to help soothe the injured tissue.

There are fibre supplements that you can take to help with passing soft stools. There are other laxatives and stool softeners which can be prescribed by the doctor. There are creams and suppositories that can be used to help with the healing of the inflammed tissue. There are also oral tablets that are prescribed to help with the prolapsed veins.

In case symptoms persist despite these measures, surgery may need to be done to correct the problem.

The gradual loss of vision,"Dear doctor,

My mum, 64, has been having problems with her eyesight. She was told that the pressure in her eyes is high. How is this possible yet she does not have night blood pressure? What causes it? Does it have treatment?



Dear reader,

The eye has various components including two types of fluid that give it shape by maintaining the pressure inside the eye. The first type of liquid is called aqueous humor and it is clear. It is found between the cornea and the lens (the front part of the eye), and the second type is vitreous humor, which is a thick gel-like fluid found between the lens and the retina (the back of the eye). The aqueous humor nourishes the eye and gives it shape. It is produced by the eye and a similar amount of what is produced per day is removed from the eye through a drainage system.

If there is excess aqueous humor produced or a blockage in the drainage system, there is a buildup of fluid, increasing the pressure inside the eye. This high pressure can damage the optic nerve, which starts at the back of the eye. This is the nerve that allows us to see. The nerve is made up of small nerve fibres. As the nerve fibres are destroyed, blind spots develop and  the entire nerve is damaged, and then there is complete blindness in that eye.

The name given to this disease where increased intra-ocular pressure (pressure inside the eye) damages the optic nerve is glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in persons over 60 years old, but the blindness can be prevented with early treatment.

There are several types of glaucoma: open angle glaucoma, which develops because of “clogging” of the drainage system. It develops slowly over time and usually has no symptoms until much later in the course of the disease. There’s closed angle or angle-closure glaucoma, which occurs when another part of the eye (the iris) suddenly blocks the drainage angle, causing the pressure to rise very quickly and thus causing eye pain, headache, nausea, seeing halos, blurred vision and can quickly cause blindness. There’s also normal pressure glaucoma, where there is damage to the optic nerve despite the intra-ocular pressure being within normal limits.

Someone has a higher risk of developing glaucoma if they have close family members who have/had glaucoma; or if aged above 40 years; or if they are long or short sighted; if they have had an eye injury; or if they have problems with the cornea or the optic nerve. There is also a higher risk of glaucoma for persons who have diabetes, high blood pressure, poor circulation and other chronic illnesses. Long term use of steroids also increases the risk of developing glaucoma.

High intra-ocular pressure and glaucoma should be treated by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). While damage from glaucoma cannot be reversed, further damage can be prevented using medication or surgery. Eye drops may be used to reduce the amount of aqueous humor being made or to improve the drainage. Surgery may also be done to improve the drainage and/or to reduce the pressure from the other part of the eye.



Dear doctor,

What is the link between eye twitching and headaches? Should I be concerned?



Dear reader,

Eye twitching is movement or spasms of the eyelids. There are different types of twitching. One type of twitching, which is rare, is benign essential blepharospasms, which starts as frequent blinking and can lead to the eyes being squeezed shut and can be quite severe. It may be caused by a problem with the nerves. Another type of twitching is hemifacial spasm, which affects one side of the face. This is may be caused by a blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve.

The most common type of twitching is called myokimia, where the twitching is mild, lasts for a short while, resolves on its own and recurs. There is no known cause for this, but it may be triggered by bright light, eye strain, eye irritation, fatigue, alcohol intake, smoking, wind, air pollution, excess caffeine intake and stress. Other conditions that can cause eye twitching include light sensitivity, inflammation of the eyes, some nerve disorders and some medications.

Recurrent headaches may be tension headaches, migraine headaches or cluster headaches. They may also be caused by an underlying illness. Some of the triggers of eye twitching can also trigger headaches such as stress, fatigue, eye strain, bright light, air pollution and nerve disorders. Eye disorders may also trigger a headache.

For myokimia, the twitching usually resolves on its own with rest, reduction of caffeine and stress relief. For the other types of twitching, it is advisable to be reviewed by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). Any other eye problems should also be treated by a doctor.

For recurrent headaches, if they cannot be controlled by avoiding the triggers and simple painkillers, then it is advisable to be reviewed by a doctor. This is because there are many possible underlying causes of headaches. Once the underlying cause is identified, the specific treatment will be given.

Everything you need to know about your gut,"In 2014, a German medical doctor and author, Giulia Enders, published a book titled –Gut; Inside Story of World’s Most Underrated Organ. It was received quite well and has so far been translated to about 30 languages. While the humour in it is unmatched, the lessons therein about the gut are memorable and important.

Years later, there seems to be a twist to that. The gut is not sold short. A new craze is cropping up online about the gut’s health and lately, content creators on TikTok and YouTube are amassing a huge following by sharing insights about what Enders classified as the ‘most underrated organ’.

Some of the people who share such content may not be professionals, which is why before taking in anything they say, speaking to a nutritionist or medical doctor will help in vindicating their posts.

Healthy Nation spoke to Abigael Kabui, a nutritionist passionate about the gut’s health, to help in elucidating all these fuss about the gut. “Your gut is your second brain,” she says.

Rightfully so as a reviewed article published in science based publication, WebMD, shows that the name given to this second brain is ‘enteric nervous system (ENS)’. Another article published on the Harvard University website shows that the brain communicates directly with the gut system –elaborating that when someone falls sick because of a certain food, they will try to avoid the place where they got it from.

“If your gut is not okay, you are generally not happy. Also, did you know that serotonin, a happy hormone, works in the brain yet it is produced in the gut?” Poses Abigael.

She explains that gut health is the overall well-being and proper functioning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which includes the stomach, small intestine, large intestine and colon. For it to be healthy, it is influenced by complex interactions between the microbiota (the community of microorganisms living in the gut), the gut lining, the immune system, and various factors such as diet, lifestyle and stress.

“When the gut is healthy, it maintains a balance of beneficial bacteria, supports the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients and helps defend against harmful pathogens. A healthy gut also contributes to overall well-being as it has been linked to various aspects of health, including mental health, immune function and even chronic disease prevention,” she explains.

Abigael notes that for a gut to be healthy, it should have a balance of bacteria in a ratio of 85:15, the good, trumping the bad. But, in our daily lives, we disrupt the functioning of the gut, which destroys the good bacteria. However, there is a solution and it is found in probiotics.

“A probiotic is a live microorganism, typically bacteria or yeasts, that when consumed in adequate amounts confers health benefits on the host. These beneficial microorganisms can colonise the gut and interact with the existing gut microbiota, promoting a healthy microbial balance,” she explains.

Some of the foods that contain probiotics are yoghurt, buttermilk, apple cider vinegar and some types of cheese.

Abigael, like Giulia Enders, is on a mission to preach the gospel of the gut and how to maintain it. After her studies, she came up with a food probiotic called Sauerkraut that is still in the process of review by relevant authorities in the country. It is a portmanteau of two German words, sauer, which means sour and kaut —cabbage. According to an article published in the New York Times, this food probiotic originated from China during the building of the Great Wall.

The masons lived on cabbage and rice. They used wine made from rice as a preservative to ferment the cabbage during winter, which forms the present day Sauerkraut. “This is cabbage fermented under certain temperatures in a certain environment for a number of days. When all conditions are in place, the product has lactobacillus bacteria with a number of strains, which is the good bacteria that we are looking for,” she explains.

She says people should not just use probiotics in their gut because they want to, advising that seeing a nutritionist is ideal.

“It is first important to note that you need to first eliminate what is causing your gut issues. This is where our nutrition knowledge also comes in line. After eliminating, you can now introduce the probiotics into your diet,” she says

Apart from ensuring there is a balance between the good and bad bacteria, Abigael explains that using probiotics helps in easing digestive issues such as bloating, gas, constipation and diarrhoea.

“Antibiotics can disrupt the balance of gut bacteria, leading to issues such as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Taking probiotics during and after antibiotic treatment may help restore the natural gut microbiota and reduce the risk of such complications.”

She advises that to check the right probiotic, you have to ensure that the bacteria strain is present in it.She advises that apart from getting probiotics to improve your gut health, there are other alternatives that you may explore.

“A nutrient-rich and balanced diet is crucial for promoting gut health. Consuming a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats provides essential nutrients and fiber that support a healthy gut microbiota.”

“Engaging in regular physical activity has been linked to improved gut health. Exercise can help stimulate gut motility and promote a diverse gut microbiota. Chronic stress can negatively impact gut health by altering gut motility, increasing inflammation and disrupting the gut microbiota,” she adds.

Abigael says incorporating stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga or engaging in hobbies can help reduce stress and promote a healthy gut. She also notes that sleep deprivation can affect the gut microbiota, increase inflammation and impact digestion.

Wonder porridge keeping learners in school,"A special herbal porridge being provided to schoolgoing children has boosted deworming efforts and increased enrolment in learning institutions, according to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri).

The Uji plus porridge, a brainchild of Terik community, was approved last month by Kemri after clinical trials were conducted in Nandi, Kirinyaga and Homa Bay counties.

The community had requested partnership with Kemri to support in scientific formulation and clinical trials of the porridge.

Kemri Director-General Maritim Songok noted that the herbal formulation designed to be taken as a school meal snack for nutrition and deworming was found to be 100 per cent effective.

He explained that the porridge eradicates skin infections including ring worms.  Prof Songok said results from the clinical trials indicated that the children who took the porridge were free from worms, their immune had been boosted and their performance in school improved.

The director-general urged the Ministry of Education and all the 47 county governments to ensure that all school going children have access to the porridge that has clinically proven to be effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis in children under six years.

He added that professionals from the Terik community have been working in collaboration with leading scientists from Japan and Canada universities.

Speaking at Kapsengere Primary School where Kemri handed over the product to the local community, Prof Songok said the porridge met all the requirements.

Terik Council Chairman John Bor said the community is in the process of setting up a factory to produce the porridge in large quantities. Already, the product has been patented with the Kenya Intellectual Property Institute .

Parents and local leaders said many learners who had dropped out of school resumed after the feeding programme was introduced.

Education officials in Nandi County said the number of children in  Early Childhood Education classes had doubled in eight local primary schools.

For instance, at Kapsengere Primary School had 24 children in ECDE but the numbers had increased to 45 children since provision of the porridge.

“We want to urge communities in Kenya who have unique herbal products that we can partner with to come forward and work with us. We will not take away your innovation. We are a public institution and we will continue to serve communities,” said Prof Songok.

Quickfire with Prof Songok

Is there any recommendation amount of Uji plus? Yes, during our clinical trials one cup of 300ml daily of Uji plus taken for two months had a good effect.

What’s the impact on enrolment?There was nearly a 100 per cent enrolment in schools where we introduced the porridge. The Introduction of school feeding programmes increases enrolment especially in rural and slum schools.

How many schools benefited from the porridge?At least 17 schools in three counties: Nandi, Kirinyaga and Homa Bay. Total number of children who took the porridge was 2,100. Clinical trials and analysis were done from 2012 to 2021.

Can it be a solution to high level of malnutrition?Yes.The greatest impact was actually observed on nutrition rather than deworming- increased appetite in children, increased weight, increased haemoglobin content with significant reduction in anemia cases.

Has it been patented?Yes, it has both a Kenya Industrial Property Institute patent and a World Intellectual Property organisation patent.

Can it be infused with other products such as milk to achieve similar results? We don’t know because we haven’t tested.

Bleeding after childbirth: What’s normal and what’s not,"Dear Healthy Nation,

I delivered through caesarian-section 10 weeks ago. Anytime I try doing some simple recommended exercise, I bleed. What could be the issue?

Anne



Dear Anne,

After giving birth, whether through caesarian-section or vaginal delivery, there is vaginal bleeding/discharge for six to eight weeks. This is called lochia and it changes over time. In the first three to four days, there is lochia rubra, which is red, and the flow is heavy, sometimes with small clots, and may be accompanied by cramping. After that, there is lochia serosa, where the discharge becomes thinner and is pinkish or brownish in colour and lasts for four to 12 days. The last stage, lochia alba, has a yellowish or white discharge with spotting and lasts for two to six weeks. Physical activity can cause heavier discharge or even cause the bleeding to start again. For this reason, it is advisable to rest and be careful with the engagement in physical activity including regular activities like climbing stairs.

The bleeding may also be due to post-partum hemorrhage, which is abnormal or heavy bleeding within 24 hours to 12 weeks after giving birth. This is a serious condition that requires urgent medical intervention.  It may be due to retained placenta, infection within the uterus, a bleeding disorder, hormonal disorders or due to a urinary tract infection.

It is advisable for you to be reviewed by a gynaecologist urgently for review. If there is postpartum hemorrhage, then the underlying cause will be addressed. If the bleeding is lochia that is prolonged or reactivated by exercise, then you need to rest and be extra careful with physical activity.





Dear Doc,

I am 22. I was born with one testicle. Recently I started getting worried about by sex life. I’m a devout Muslim and I have never engaged in sexual intercourse. I am worried about my marital life: maybe I won’t satisfy my wife or maybe I won’t sire children. What should I do? How will I get help? Kindly advise



Dear reader,

When there is only one testicle in the scrotal sac, this is called monorchia or monorchidism. It could be because one testicle was not formed at all or it is undescended. When the baby is forming during pregnancy, the testicles develop within the abdomen and then travel down to the scrotal sac during the last three months of pregnancy. If the testicles have not descended by the time of birth, in most boys, they will come down within the first six months. If the testicles are missing, then one or both testicles may be trapped within the path between the abdomen and the scrotum, and if this is the case, surgery can be done to bring the testicle(s) down and attach it/them to the scrotal sac. However, for the undescended testicle to be able to function normally, then it needs to be corrected within the first year of life.

It is advisable for you to be reviewed by a doctor and get an ultrasound scan to determine whether the second testicle is undescended or if it never formed. If it is undescended, it needs to be located and corrected or removed depending on where it is found and the condition it is in.

For those with one healthy testicle, the sexual function and fertility is usually normal, so unless there are other attendant issues, you should be able to have a mutually satisfying relationship with your future spouse and to have children, should you so wish.



What is a cyst and how does it develop?

Please shed light on this.



Dear reader,

A cyst is an abnormal pocket of fluid or semi-solid material that can form anywhere in the body including the skin, brain, bones and internal organs. Most cysts are non-cancerous and may vary from very small in size to very large, and sometimes may be painful. It may also cause a swelling or a lump. Cysts do not usually cause problems unless they are very large, or they are infected, or they are pressing on a nerve or a blood vessel or if they are affecting how an organ works or if they are cancerous.

A cyst may form as a result of an injury, or due to blockage of a duct or passage; or because of a problem with the body tissue in a particular area, or due to infection with a parasite. It may also be as a result of genetic changes or due to inflammation. Rarely, a cyst will be cancerous. All abnormal lumps in the body should be examined, including cysts. Depending on the location, the contents and the symptoms, the cyst may be left untouched, or it may be surgically removed. After removal, the contents are examined for cancer and any identifiable cause such as an infection. Sometimes cysts may develop complications like pain, infection, bleeding and inflammation of surrounding tissues in case they rupture.

When a person’s blood is ‘excess’ and requires to be extracted,"Dear Healthy Nation,

Is there a condition where someone has too much blood in the body that needs to be removed? Does it have any negative side effects? My neighbour died suddenly last week, and this was said to be the cause. Is that possible?

Dear reader,

There is a rare condition called polycythemia or erythrocytosis, where there is a high concentration of red blood cells in the blood, making the blood thicker than it should be, and it flows sluggishly through the blood vessels.

Polycythemia can cause dizziness, fainting, headache, blurred vision, high blood pressure, bleeding problems, or itchy skin. The sluggish blood flow can also lead to development of a blood clot, which can be deadly if the clot blocks blood flow to vital organs, like the lungs.

Polycythemia may be as a result of a genetic disorder known as Polycythimia Vera that leads to excessive production of red blood cells. It may also develop as a result of having excessive erythropoietin, the hormone that promotes production of red blood cells. This may occur due to some kidney diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other illnesses.

Another possible cause of polycythemia is where the number of red blood cells is normal but the plasma (the liquid part of blood) is reduced, for instance due to dehydration, or as a consequence of taking some blood pressure medications, or due to obesity, smoking, or excessive alcohol consumption.

This can be corrected if the underlying cause is addressed. Polycythimia may develop as a normal physiological adaptation to the environment, for instance in persons who live in high-altitude areas that have a low oxygen concentration.

Athletes may take advantage of this effect by training at high altitude, though it may not be effective. Use of anabolic steroids and blood doping may also cause polycythemia.

Polycythemia is diagnosed through blood tests. Additional tests depend on the suspected underlying cause of polycythemia. An example is an abdominal ultrasound scan to check the kidneys. Polycythemia can be managed by venesection, which is removal of blood, usually about half a litre of blood, which is done as per the doctor’s instructions.

There are also medications to slow down the production of red blood cells, and medication to prevent blood clots. Any treatable underlying causes should also be attended to. The genetic disorder cannot be cured. Lifestyle changes like maintaining healthy weight, limiting alcohol consumption and cessation of smoking would also be beneficial.

When a child is jumpy and unable to focus,"Dear doctor,My son is nine years old and in Class Four. When he was three, he was diagnosed with ADHD. I thought it would go away as he grew older, but he still has many of the same symptoms that he had. Is there a cure for ADHD?Concerned parent

Dear concerned parent,

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder that is characterised by either inattention, which is difficulty with focusing on something for a period of time; or hyperactivity, that is, having excessive movement that does not suit the occasion; or impulsivity, which is acting quickly, on the moment, without giving the action (and consequences) much thought.

Someone may have one or more of these components, which manifest themselves in different ways in different settings, and may change over time. For example, hyperactivity and impulsiveness in a child may be difficulty sitting still in class, and excessive running around and climbing at home, while for an adult, it may be constant fidgeting and squirming in the seat while in a meeting, and having difficulty waiting in a traffic jam.

ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, especially at the time when children start school (around three years of age). By the time the children reach the teen years, about half of them no longer have ADHD symptoms. However, ADHD can continue into adulthood.

Management for ADHD includes behaviour management strategies, or medication or both. As the child grows older, he/she can also be taught self-management strategies. The support of family and the school community is also vital.

The forgotten foods that can feed Kenya amid climate crisis,"Even as Kenya grapples with the challenge of food insecurity following six failed crop seasons, the country also boasts a diversity of indigenous food varieties.

For most Kenyans, food entails exotic vegetables and cereals. Collard greens, spinach and cabbage constitute the vegetable component of dishes in most Kenyan households.

But did you know that the country has more than 200 different species of indigenous vegetables?

Dr Patrick Maundu is a Kenyan ethnobotanist who has dedicated his entire life to research in the indigenous knowledge of African biodiversity in health and nutrition. He joined the National Museums of Kenya in 1989 and now heads the Kenya Resource Centre For Indigenous Knowledge (Kenrik).

Dr Patrick Maundu, an ethnobotanist at the Kenya Resource Centre for Indigenous Knowledge, explains the importance of Amaranth, also known as Terere, at the National Museum of Kenya on April 11, 2023.

Kenrik was established in 1992 to spearhead the work on Indigenous Food Plants Programme (IFPP), which was under East Africa Herbarium (EAH). The objective was to distribute information on edible wild plants collected for more than 90 years.

The institution now documents, preserves and disseminates indigenous knowledge on traditional food plants, traditional medicinal plants, sacred sites, eco- logical knowledge systems and building structures, says Dr Maundu.

The ethnobotanist believes in food diversification as an approach to boost household and community nutrition and security. He underscores the need to promote these varieties amid the current hunger crisis.

“It is unfortunate that we prioritised eating what our colonisers thought was better at the expense of what many generations before us ate. With the ongoing food shortages, we might have to go back to our roots. Indigenous foods are healthier. They kept our forefathers healthy and alive,” he argues.

Besides their higher nutritional value, Dr Maundu points out that these food crops are more tolerant to changing and unpredictable weather patterns. They also grow in most parts of the country, unlike exotic crops such as maize and wheat which only grow in specific regions.

Food for a hotter planet

Food for a hotter planet

Some parts of these crops are used as medicine, and some cost a pittance compared to other food varieties.

Healthy Nation has compiled a list of some of the traditional vegetables, tubers, cereals and even insects that Kenyans could tap into for better nutrition and health.

Cereals

Cereals are grains used for food and include wheat, maize and rye. These are also cereals indigenous to Kenya and Africa.

Finger millet- Wimbi (Eleusine coracana)

Although it received less attention in the first Green Revolution, finger millet has both a rich nutrient profile and a climate resilience nature. Its seeds provide energy while its calcium content is much higher (almost 10-fold) than any other cereal crop. Additionally, it has better resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses and a long shelf-life of seeds. . It is still an important crop in the Lake Victoria basin, West Pokot, parts of Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet.

Also known as finger millet,Eleusine coracana has both a rich nutrient profile and a climate resilience nature.

Pearl millet- Mawele (Pennisetum glaucum)

Pearl millet is considered a staple food in Africa and India, where it is used to make flour for bread, porridge and other meals. Besides its tolerance to acidity in sandy soils, it can grow in saline soils as well. It is also hardier than maize and sorghum and grows where these cereals cannot grow because of drought.  It is grown in the drier parts of eastern and coastal parts of Kenya.

Sorghum bicolor (great millet)

Commonly known as sorghum, great millet is high in carbohydrates, with 10 per cent protein  and 3.4 per cent fat  content. It also contains calcium and small amounts of iron, vitamin B as well as niacin.  The gluten-free grain is usually ground into a meal that is made into porridge, flatbreads and cakes. It’s found in Eastern and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Pseudo-cereals

These are food crops that are non-grass in nature but are grown for their edible starchy seeds. They are grown for the same purpose as grassy crops.

Tsimboka (Amaranthus cruentus)

Tsimboka is a vegetable in the Luhya language. This variety is one of three Amaranthus species cultivated as a grain source. The fast-growing plant that is topped with clusters of dark pink flowers matures in between four and seven weeks. It can continue to produce for up to 250 days.

The seeds are cooked whole or ground into flour to make highly nutritious cakes. Besides the seeds, the leaves can be cooked as any other vegetable and are rich in vitamins A and C in addition to minerals such as iron and calcium. Found in Western, Eastern and Central region.

Amaranthus cruentus ,popularly known as ‘tsimboka’ in Luhya land, this is one of three Amaranthus species cultivated as a grain source.

Starchy fruits

Banana (Musa spp)

This is a nutritious fruit that grows from various large, herbaceous flowering plants from the genus Musa. Its flesh is soft, rich in starch and its skin (usually easy to peel) can either remain green or turn yellow, red, purple or brown when ripe.

Bananas contain high levels of minerals and phytochemicals (compounds produced by plants, generally to help them resist fungi, bacteria and plant virus infections) including flavonoids, which are beneficial for human nutrition.

Bananas grow in most parts of Kenya, including in counties in the Upper Eastern region, Central and Western Kenya.

Pulse/Legume

Bambara Groundnut, Tsimbande (Vigna subterranean)

Dr Maundu argues that unlike other groundnut varieties in Africa, Bambara groundnuts are an ancient type of Uganda grain legume. The edible nutty part – which can be red, brown, cream or burgundy – is protected by a skin similar to that of peanuts. The seeds ripen underground for between three and four months. When the plants start to wilt, they are ready for harvesting.

Ripe or immature, raw or roasted, the seeds are highly rich in nutrients, including 60 per cent carbohydrate and 20 per cent protein content. These nuts also contain oil and other micronutrients. Notably, this protein food provides more methionine than any other legume.

The nuts are aired in the sun, then steamed or boiled until they are soft enough to eat. The pods can be used as fuel. Found mostly in Western and Central parts of Kenya.

In Luhya land, Bambara groundnuts  are popularly known as ‘tsimbande’. The edible part, the nut—which can be reddish, brownish, cream- coloured or burgundy—is protected by a skin similar to that of peanuts.

Cowpea- Kunde (Vignia unguiculata)

Owing to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall, the cowpea is an important food crop in most semiarid regions of Africa. Typically, the crop is a climber and has trailing vines that bear edible compound leaves with three leaflets. The white, purple or pale-yellow flowers grow in pairs or in threes at the ends of long stalks. The pods are long and cylindrical and can grow for between 20 and 30 cm.

There are many ways to eat cowpeas. The leaves may be boiled or stir-fried, the green pods may be eaten fresh, steamed, stir-fried or sautéed. The dry seeds are often used in soups, stews, purees or ground into flour or fermented.

In terms of nutritional value cowpeas contain beta-carotene, vitamin E, riboflavin, folic acid, ascorbic acid, calcium, iron, protein while seed protein is relatively rich in lysine. Found in Western, Central, Eastern and parts of Northern Kenya.

Peanut- Njugu Karanga (Arachis hypogea)

The name hypogaea means ‘‘under the earth’’ since the pods containing the edible seeds grow below the ground. Peanuts thrive in warm climates with well-drained, light, sandy or loam soils.

The herbaceous perennial plant produces flowers above the ground but develops the fruit below ground in a process known as geocarpy.

Peanut seeds are edible and are high in protein and other minerals and vitamins. Roots, seed hulls or leaves are used for production of cosmetic products, among them soaps, plastics, wallboard, livestock feed, fertiliser filler and alternative fuels.

The peanut is the most common edible plant part and is consumed either raw or cooked. It is also made into oils, after removal of fats, and ground into flour. Young leaves and tips may be suitable as cooked green vegetables.  They are found in Western, Eastern and Central parts of Kenya.

Pigeon pea- Mbaazi (Cajanus cajan)

The pigeon pea is a woody shrub that reaches only about four centimetres high upon maturity. The plant has deep tap roots, which allow it to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. The edible parts include the seeds, seedpods, leaves and young shoots.

Pigeon pea is also well known for its medicinal benefits with leaves used as treatment for coughs, bronchitis, diarrhoea, haemorrhages, sores, and wounds. Diabetes and sore throats can also be treated using other plant parts of pigeon pea.

The crop is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics. Found in Western and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Roots and tubers

These are specialised storage stems of certain starchy seed plants that are typically short and thickened and usually grow below the soil.

Aerial yam (Dioscorea bulbifera)

This tuber crop is also known as ‘‘bitter yam’’ or ‘‘ritugu’’ in the Maragoli. It has aerial, potato-like tubers that grow at the leaf axils. The plant is often cultivated in tropical areas mainly for its edible aerial bulbs. The juice from its roots are used to treat threadworms. Found in Western Kenya.

Cassava, Muhogo (Manihot esculenta)

This is a tuberous, starchy edible root. Cassava may be eaten raw or cooked. Some parts of the plant are highly toxic that could kill if eaten.

The cassava shrub may grow up to 2.75 m tall. This food plant is also medicinally used to treat hypertension, headache, and other pains, irritable bowel syndrome and fever.

According to the ethnobotanist, the cassava plant contains two different cyanogenic glucosides, linamarin and lotaustralin. Its fresh roots and leaves contain linamarin and hydrocyanic acid at levels that may be toxic. When properly treated through either roasting, soaking or fermentation, the cyanide content is negligible and largely harmless. Found in Western and Coast regions.

African eggplant, Mbilingani (Solanum macrocarpon)

This rare eggplant relative is known as ‘‘lisucha’’ among most Kenyans. All parts of the plant are useful, with its leaves cooked in vegetable soups in the same way as collard greens. The fruit is eaten when cooked with rice in many parts of Africa. Meanwhile, its root is used to treat bronchitis, itch, body aches and asthma. Its seeds treat toothache.

The juice from the vegetables is used in the treatment of gout, rheumatism and angina. In some communities, it is used as a traditional anesthesia during childbirth. Found in Western, Central and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Slender leaf, Mitoo (Crotalaria brevidens)

The slender leaf is a food legume. Its young leaves and shoots are cooked as a vegetable in Kenya and Tanzania. It can be boiled or fried or used as a potherb in stews and soups.

In Africa, the slender leaf is mainly harvested as a vegetable by uprooting the whole plant. The uprooted thinnings may be used as a first harvest and the remaining plants are ready just before flowering after about eight weeks.

In Kenya the leaves are used to cure stomach-ache, swellings and even malaria. The roots are used to treat sore throats and mouth thrush. The shoots of the plant may be used as livestock fodder and seeds fed to poultry, discloses Dr Maundu.

A recent botanical use for the slender leaf is as an agent to promote the germination of Striga, a parasitic plant that is a major problem for maize and millet growers in Western Kenya. Found in Western, Central and Eastern parts of Kenya

Flying termites, Kumbe kumbe

Commonly known as ‘‘amatere’’ or ‘‘amatelle’’ in Western Kenya, these insects have been used for food for centuries. The male and female termites are rich in vitamins A and C. The worker termites, though, have the highest vitamin C content while Queen has the highest vitamin A content.

For centuries, insects have played an important role in human nutrition. It is believed that the first hominids in Africa were eating insects, including termites. They are a good source of protein with high fat content.

Termites are found in most parts of the country.

Termitomyces spp, Obwoba

These are seasonal fruit bodies of edible fungi and a genus of mushrooms whose seasonal edible fructifications are found exclusively in certain regions of Africa and Asia.

Termitomyces only grow in association with termites. Their nests are made of organic matter brought by the insects from feeding on trees.

According to Dr Maundu, the fungus helps the termites to degrade the plant-derived material such as wood, dry grass and leaf litter on which they live.

So far twenty edible species of termitomyces have been recorded from Africa and Asia. Found in Western Kenya as well as in semi-arid regions.

Conkerberry (Carissa spinarum)

Known as ‘‘ochuoga’’ in Luo Land and ‘‘matote’’ elsewhere in Kenya, this is a wild, spiny and evergreen shrub whose fruits are of commercial interest. The plant does well in hotter and drier tropics with deep, fertile soils. It can also thrive in dry, sandy and rocky soils according to the expert.

The red-black sweet fruit ripens to a blue-black colour. It is pleasant to eat raw or cooked in jams. Among communities where this shrub grows, the roots are often put in water gourds to give water a pleasant flavour.

They can also be added to soups and stews for flavour and to disguise the strong aroma of other foods. Found in Eastern Kenya.

Spider Plant, Sagaa (Gynandropsis gynandra)

In most Kenyan households, sagaa is a staple. This indigenous leafy vegetable is ranked the second most nutritious among the top four indigenous leafy vegetables consumed as relish. The others are pigweed (Amaranthus blitum), nightshade (Solanum scabrum) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). It is recommended for pregnant and lactating mothers owing to its richness in proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates and minerals.

Moreover, sagaa has medicinal compounds that prevent cancer, asthma, diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases.  The vegetable that is a source of edible oils and is used in manufacture of livestock feed can also be used as an insecticide. Found in Western, Central and Coastal parts of Kenya.

Experts call for urgent action to eliminate trans fats in East Africa,"Health experts have urged East African leaders to take immediate action to eliminate trans fats from food supplies in order to reduce the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

Non-communicable diseases continue to be a significant health concern in the region, with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) being the leading cause of death. Recent studies have shown that trans fats, a type of unsaturated fat commonly found in processed foods, significantly increase the risk of CVDs.

Trans fats, also known as trans fatty acids, are found in foods such as fried and baked goods, shortening, margarine, red meat, and dairy products. They contribute to cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

In Kenya, NCDs were responsible for 39 per cent of deaths in 2020, up from 27 per cent in 2014. More than half of these diseases occur in people aged 40 or younger.

Risk factors include unhealthy diets, tobacco consumption and a lack of exercise. Without robust measures, one in five adults and one in 10 children and teenagers are projected to be obese by December 2023, according to a 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) analysis.

The WHO recommends that trans-fat intake be limited to less than 1 per cent of total energy intake, equivalent to less than 2.2 grammes per day in a 2,000-calorie diet.

Unfortunately, many people in the East African region consume much more than this recommended amount. Trans fats have been shown to increase the risk of CVDs by raising cholesterol levels (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and lowering cholesterol levels (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL).

In addition, trans fats have been linked to inflammation, insulin resistance and other health problems.

""We call on East African leaders to prioritise the regulation of trans fats to address the significant burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, in the region. A harmonised regulation of trans fats has the potential to promote health and save lives. The time for urgent action is now as the longer we wait, the more lives will be lost to these preventable diseases,"" said Celine Awuor, CEO of the International Institute for Legislative Affairs.

NCDs are estimated to cause about 540,000 deaths globally each year. In the East African Community, it is estimated that about 40 per cent of all deaths annually are caused by NCDs.

CVDs account for 25 per cent of all hospital admissions and are costly to manage, resulting in catastrophic spending at the household levels that sink vulnerable patients and their dependents into poverty, according to Dr Lilian Mbau, CEO of the Kenya Cardiac Society.

""Up to 80 per cent of these deaths can be prevented through reduction of risk factors such as unhealthy foods, sedentary lifestyles, smoking and excessive use of alcohol. It is estimated that up to 22 per cent of heart attacks are due to consumption of trans fats.

We urgently need to work towards putting in place policies and legislation to protect our population against exposure to trans fats and other unhealthy foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages borrowing from the successes made to regulate tobacco use,"" added Dr Mbau.

Gideon Ogutu, a nutrition scientist at the International Institute for Legislative Affairs, believes that by implementing a regional regulation on trans fats, the region can take a proactive approach to safeguarding our health and protecting ourselves from the dangers of these detrimental substances.

“It is imperative to recognise the critical importance of regulating trans fats, an abnormal fatty acid that acts in direct contrast to the beneficial properties of healthy fats. Consuming trans fats is not only void of nutritional value but poses a significant threat to our health,” noted Mr Ogutu

Experts are further concerned that Kenya's Food, Drugs, and Chemical Substance Act, Cap 254 (Legal Notice 115 of 2015), which attempts to regulate Industrially Produced Trans Fatty Acids (iTFA), cannot be implemented because it does not mention iTFA limits explicitly.

"Rabies: Symptoms, causes and treatment","Rabies is a viral disease with a very high fatality rate. It is mostly associated with dog bites. It causes progressive inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, all until the patient's demise.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are two types of  rabies disease: furious rabies and paralytic rabies.

“Furious rabies causes fear of water, hyperactivity, and excitable behaviour. In some incidents, the patient might also be afraid of fresh air,” states the WHO.

Death from furious rabies usually occurs after a few days as a result of cardio-respiratory arrest.

Paralytic rabies takes a longer time to affect the patient but it also ends fatally. When a patient has this type of rabies, their muscles will gradually become paralysed. This paralysis will start off at the site of the bite or scratch.

This is followed by a coma that ends in death. The WHO cautions that this form of rabies is very easily misdiagnosed, which regularly results in defective treatment methods.

Burden of disease

In Kenya, the Ministry of Health’s 2014 to 2030 Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Human Rabies estimates that up to 2,000 people die annually due to rabies.

This has seen the Ministry of Health (MOH) rank rabies as one of the top five zoonotic diseases in Kenya.

Globally, 60,000 people die from rabies. Of these, 95 per cent of deaths occur in Africa. Data from the WHO shows that the burden of disease is disproportionally borne by rural poor populations where educational awareness on the rabies disease is low.

An estimated half of cases in rural populations are attributable to children under 15 years of age.

Causes

According to the Ministry of Health (MoH), 98 per cent of all cases of rabies in humans are transmitted by dogs.

“People are usually infected following a bite or scratch by an infected dog. Transmission can also occur when infectious material – usually saliva – comes into direct contact with human mucosa or fresh skin wounds,” MoH says.

“Human-to-human transmission through bite is possible but rare.”

Apart from dogs, it is also possible to get infected after a bite from an infected animal classified as a mammal, for example, a bat.

An infected animal may show certain warning signs. According to the Centre for Disease Control, an infected dog may for instance be very aggressive and make an attempt to bite you.

This dog will also be equally aggressive towards other animals. You may also notice that it is drooling more than normal.

“There are also infected dogs and animals that will look timid and shy and allow you to get close to them before lashing to bite or scratch you,” the CDC cautions.

Other signs you should look out for, CDC says, include a dog that looks sickly, has difficulty swallowing, keeps biting at imaginary things, has trouble moving or looks paralysed, and appears calmer and timid than usual.

Symptoms

According to the CDC, symptoms of rabies in animals are similar to those in people. These symptoms will vary from early signs that are not specific to the rabies disease, followed by acute neurologic symptoms, then death.

The CDC says the early symptoms will tend to be similar to those of the flu. These will include fever, headache, discomfort and general fatigue.

The patient may also experience and unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensation known as paraesthesia at the wound site.

“After the early stage, symptoms of rabies are elevated to cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. This is followed by delirium, abnormal behaviour, hallucinations, fear of water, and insomnia.""

These symptoms can last from two to 10 days after which the disease becomes fatal. “Chances of survival after clinical rabies are very minimal. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease almost always ends with death. Treatment at this stage is mostly supportive,” the CDC states.

According to the WHO, rabies spreads to the central nervous system, and triggers a fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

Treatment

Treatment for rabies is through post-exposure prophylaxis. According to the WHO, this treatment method is designed to stop the rabies virus from getting into your central nervous system.

This treatment should start as soon as the bite has taken place to prevent the onset of symptoms or death.

“Treatment may include extensive washing and local treatment of the bite wound or scratch, administration of potent and effective rabies vaccine that meets the WHO standards, and the administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG),” the WHO states.

Per the CDC, a post-exposure prophylaxis programme will consist of one dose of immune globin and four doses of the rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. “Rabies immune globulin and the first dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health care provider as soon as possible after exposure,” cites the CDC.

Prevention

According to the WHO nipping the cause at the source is the best way to prevent rabies. This involves vaccination of your pet against rabies.

This vaccination must be regular as prescribed by a qualified veterinarian. “Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease that can be nipped in the bud through vaccination of dogs. This vaccination will reduce dog-related rabies as well as post dog-bite post-exposure prophylaxis care for the patient,” the WHO states.

If you suspect that your pet has contracted rabies, you should promptly consult a qualified veterinarian to handle it.

“If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal, it is very critical that you consult your physician immediately for post-exposure prophylaxis medical care,” the WHO recommends.

Since children are at an increased risk of getting infected by an infected pet, you should teach them how to protect themselves when around new pets and what to do when attacked. Some of the tips you can share with them include:

Never approach a dog that’s hissing or attempting to peck, scratch or bite.Never go near strange dogs. Always stick with other children when near unfamiliar dogs to avoid accidental scratches, bites or pecks.Never feed a dog with their bare hands.Keep from touching or rattling a dog before it sees or familiarises with them.Always report when scratched or bitten by a dogAlways ask for permission from you or the dog’s guardian if they intend to play with it.Always ask how friendly the dog is.

"Osteoporosis: Symptoms, causes and treatment","Osteoporosis is a medical condition in which bones become weak and brittle. When an individual has osteoporosis, they are at a greater risk for sudden and unexpected bone fractures.

According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the onset of osteoporosis will mean that you will have less bone mass and strength.

“People who come down with osteoporosis are more likely to break bones. This is most often in the hip, forearm, wrist, and spine,” the CDC says. “While bones can get broken as a result of a fall or an accident, osteoporosis weakens them to an extent where the bones break at from alarmingly easy causes. These can include coughing or bumping into something.”

In addition, osteoporosis can cause the bones in the spine to break and begin to collapse. According to the CDC, if this happens, the height of the patient might be affected. The patient may no longer be able to stand straight and may appear to be shorter than they usually are.

“Where the patient has suffered broken hips, they may no longer be able to live independently, and may have a higher mortality rate,” the CDC states.

Osteoporosis is not easy to determine unless the patient receives medical screening and testing. The CDC states that the majority of people who get this condition do not know that they have osteoporosis until after they have broken a bone.

Who is at risk?

Women are at an increased risk of getting osteoporosis over men. According to the CDC, this is because women have lower peak bone mass and generally smaller bones than men.

“Osteoporosis affects women at a higher ratio of 1 in 5 for women aged 50 and over in contrast to a ration of 1 in 20 for men in the same age bracket,” the CDC says. In the majority of cases, women develop osteoporosis one to two years before menopause.

A family history of osteoporosis is also a risk factor. If one of your parents struggles with osteoporosis, there is an elevated risk that you may get this condition as well.

According to the United States’ biomedical research agency National Institute of Health (NIH), low levels of hormones can increase your risk of developing osteoporosis.

“These include low oestrogen in women after menopause, low oestrogen due to delayed or missing periods caused by hormonal disorders and aggressive physical activities in premenopausal women, and low levels of testosterone in men,” cites the NIH.

There are also medical conditions that might set you on a collision path with osteoporosis. These include diabetes, kidney failure, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and a history of breast cancer.

Symptoms

Osteoporosis rarely exhibits symptoms. However, by knowing the risk factors associated with it, you will be better placed to spot signs and symptoms that might point toward developing this condition.

These symptoms include frequent, easy bone fractures, an apparent loss of height, a change in your general posture (for example, you might start bending forward or start stooping), frequent, persistent pain in your lower back, and shortness of breath. According to the CDC, this shortness of breath is caused by compressed disks that make your lungs smaller.

At the onset of this condition, you might notice that the grip of your hand has become very weak and that your gums are receding. This will be the result of your jaws losing bone mass.

Treatment and management

The management and treatment for osteoporosis mainly involves treating and preventing broken bones, and taking medicine to strengthen bones.

Here, the target is to slow or stop bone loss altogether, and prevent possible fractures as much as possible.

According to the NIH, the treatment regime that your doctor will recommend will usually involve medication, a proper, well-balanced diet (nutrition), lifestyle changes, exercises, and prevention of fractures.

If you have osteoporosis or think you might be at risk, there are some steps that you can take to manage this condition or keep it at bay.

According to the CDC, these include taking prescribed and medically approved medications to strengthen your bones, stopping smoking and avoiding alcohol, doing guided exercises to improve your weight abilities, and eating a healthy diet that contains the right amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

Calcium and vitamin D will be critical in helping your bones reach their peak bone mass. “If you do not teat enough calcium, your body will take it from your bones. This may lead to bone loss, bone weakening and bone thinning which trigger osteoporosis,” the NIH cautions.

Per the NIH, products you can consume to boost your calcium intake include low-fat dairy products, turnip greens, broccoli, sardines and salmon, soy milk, orange juice, cereals, and breads.

You should take these together with foods that give you vitamin D that aids in the absorption of calcium from the intestine.

“You get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight, and from certain foods including fatty fish, fish oils, egg yolks, liver, milk and cereals,” states the NIH.

People aged between 18 and 50 years need 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. This daily amount increases to 1,200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70 years old.

If you are taking calcium supplements, you should be careful not to trigger kidney stones. Your total calcium intake from supplements and diet combined should not be more than 2,000 milligrams daily if you are aged 50 years and above.

Eat properly. For instance, excessive dieting or poor protein intake will increase your risk of bone loss and trigger the development of osteoporosis.

Avoid taking alcohol. According to the NIH, regularly drinking more than two alcoholic drinks per day will increase your risk of developing osteoporosis.

It is also recommended that you engage in regular weight exercises help to build up your bone mass. These exercises include walking, jogging, climbing stairs, and dancing. They are exercises that you do on your feet so that your weight is supported by your bones.

You may combine weight-bearing exercises with strength exercises to firm up your muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine, and balance exercises to stabilise yourself from falls.

Rickets: How to identify and prevent your child from getting it,"If you are a parent, there is a good chance you have heard of rickets. However, would you imagine it striking your child?

Rickets is a disease that has been around for centuries and primarily affects young children. The good news is that rickets is preventable and treatable.

Rickets is a skeletal disorder that causes the softening and weakening of bones in children. This condition is primarily driven by a lack of vitamin D, essential for calcium absorption.

Rickets can also be caused by a lack of phosphorus and calcium in the diet or by liver and kidney disorders that prevent the body from properly using vitamin D.

In adults, osteomalacia (softening of bones) is a common condition caused by vitamin D deficiency.

Causes of rickets in children

Limited exposure to sunlight:

Children who spend most of their time indoors may not get enough vitamin D from sunlight.

Poor diet:

A diet that does not include foods that are rich in vitamin D and calcium can lead to rickets. Foods that are high in vitamin D include fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, egg yolk, fortified milk, cereal, and orange juice.

Liver or kidney disorders:

Certain liver and kidney disorders can prevent the body from converting vitamin D into its active form.

Medications:

Some medications, such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids, can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb or use vitamin D.



What are the symptoms of rickets?

There are many signs and symptoms of rickets. Some of the most common include:

1. Poor growth and development, including a failure to reach typical height milestones

2. Bone pain, especially in the legs and spine

3. Muscle weakness

4. Legs appear curved

5. Protruding abdomen or forehead

6. Fractures

7. Rickets can also cause dental problems

8. Oddly shaped breastbone and ribcage

What increases the likelihood of developing rickets?

Age

Rickets can happen to children of any age, but it is more likely to occur in young children. Their bones are still growing, so they need vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus to help them grow strong.

Dark skin

People with dark skin are more likely to develop rickets because they have less vitamin D in their skin. This is because melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, blocks the body's ability to absorb vitamin D from sunlight.

Exclusive breastfeeding

Babies who are exclusively breastfed are also at a higher risk of developing rickets. This is because breast milk does not contain enough vitamin D to meet the needs of a growing baby.

Diet

A diet that is low in calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D can also lead to rickets. This is especially true if a child does not eat foods that are rich in these nutrients or if they do not get enough sunlight.

Family history

Some genes are linked to a higher risk of developing rickets. This means that if someone in your family has rickets, you may be more likely to develop it as well.

Premature birth

Babies who are born prematurely are also at a higher risk of developing rickets. This is because they may not have had enough time in the womb to build up their stores of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus.

Mother's deficiency

If a mother is deficient in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus during pregnancy, her baby may be born with rickets. This is because these nutrients are essential for the development of strong bones.

What are the potential complications of rickets?

If left untreated, rickets can lead to a number of complications. These include:

Bone deformitiesSeizuresHeart failureProlonged disabilityDental problemsDelayed growth and development

How can you prevent rickets?

The best way to prevent rickets is to make sure that you and your children get enough vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus. This can be done by:

Spending time outside in the sun: Exposure to sunlight is the best way to get vitamin D. Just make sure to use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Eating a balanced diet: A diet that includes foods such as fatty fish, fortified milk, and eggs can help ensure that you are getting enough vitamin D. Taking supplements: If you are unable to get enough vitamin D from sunlight and food, you may need to take a supplement. This is especially important for pregnant women and babies who are breastfed exclusively. Fortified infant supplements packed with vitamin D are available for purchase over the counter. Talking to your doctor: If you think you or your child may be at risk for rickets, talk to your doctor.

How to treat rickets

If your child is diagnosed with rickets, their doctor will likely recommend a course of treatment that includes:

Vitamin D supplements: This is the most important part of treatment. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for bone health. Calcium and phosphorus supplements: These may be necessary if your child's diet is lacking in these nutrients. Increased exposure to sunlight: This can help improve vitamin D levels. A balanced diet: A diet that includes foods such as fatty fish, fortified milk, and eggs can help ensure that your child is getting enough vitamin D.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct bone deformities. This is usually only done if the deformities are severe and causing pain or difficulty walking.

Rickets is a condition that can attract stigma and discrimination. This is because it is often seen as a disease of poverty. However, rickets can affect people of all socioeconomic backgrounds.

If you think you or your child may be at risk for rickets, talk to your doctor. They can help you determine if you need to take supplements or make changes to your diet. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for preventing complications.

"Alzheimer’s disease: Causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment","Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease characterised by the destruction and loss of function of brain cells. The destruction and loss of function of the brain cells leads to dementia i.e., the loss of cognitive function - memory, reasoning, and thinking.

Based on this relationship, Alzheimer's disease is described both as a cause and a type of dementia. As the condition progresses, the loss of cognitive function hinders the person's ability to carry out the simplest tasks of daily living. Advanced Alzheimer's disease also affects the patients' social well-being as they forget the people in their lives and their relationship.

What causes Alzheimer's?

It has been over a century since Alois Alzheimer observed anomalies in the brains of patients with dementia. Since then, scientists have quite a clear understanding of the biochemical changes that happen in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Despite the remarkable progress in understanding the disease, it is still not clear what causes the biochemical changes that lead to the deterioration of the brain and subsequent dementia.

However, some risk factors have been identified as possible contributors to the development of the disease. These include:

Old age

Alzheimer's is most common among people above 65 years of age. However, this does not mean that old age causes Alzheimer's. A lot of old people, even those with dementia, do not have Alzheimer's. Also, many younger people have also been diagnosed with the illness. The prevalence among old people might also be due to the slow progression of the illness.

Heredity or genetic disposition

People with a family member who has Alzheimer's disease are at an increased risk of developing the condition, first, due to genetic make-up. A gene known as apolipoprotein E type 4 (APOE e4) is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. If you inherit this gene from one parent, your chances of developing Alzheimer's disease are quite high. The probability increases almost eight-fold if you inherit the genes from both parents.

Secondly, people from the same family have similar chances of getting Alzheimer's disease because they are exposed to the same factors such as diet, lifestyle, and genetic illnesses. These could either increase or reduce the family's predisposition to develop Alzheimer's disease.

Down syndrome

The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that over 30 per cent of people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease at around 50 years of age. In relation to Alzheimer's, this is a quite a young age. By the age of 60 years, this increases to over 50 per cent. For comparison, in the general population, Alzheimer's average prevalence is at 10 per cent for people above the age of 65.

Head injuries

For years, it has been theorised that head injuries may aggravate the formation of Amyloid Beta (Aβ). The Amyloid Beta protein is associated with the degeneration of the brain leading to Alzheimer's dementia. Studies have shown a strong correlation between head injuries in older people and Alzheimer's. However, scientists still recommended further research because the causality has not been determined conclusively.

Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease

Memory loss

One of the first and most noticeable symptoms of Alzheimer's disease is memory loss. This could manifest as forgetting recent events, conversations, or appointments. This is beyond the normal forgetfulness, and it gets progressively worse. In some cases, patients may even forget their close relatives and friends, and how to do simple tasks such as brushing their teeth or cooking a meal.

Difficulty in completing familiar tasks

As the disease progresses, patients may find it hard to complete familiar tasks. This could be because they forget how to do them or because the task has become too complicated for them. For instance, someone who has been driving for many years may find it hard to follow the rules of the road or operate a vehicle.

It also affects body functions such as swallowing. Swallowing is notable because food and drinks get misdirected to the windpipe instead of the oesophagus. The food particles cause infections, notably pneumonia, which is a major cause of death for people with Alzheimer's.

Problems with language

Patients with Alzheimer's disease may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may also stop in the middle of a sentence and have no idea how to continue or they may repeat themselves. In more advanced stages, patients may have trouble understanding common words and expressions.

Disorientation

Patients with Alzheimer's disease may lose track of time, place, and even people. For instance, they may get up in the middle of the night and wander around aimlessly. This could be because they forget where they are or who the people around them are.

Changes in mood and behaviour

Patients with Alzheimer's disease may experience changes in their mood and behaviour. This could manifest as anxiety, depression, irritability, aggression, or apathy.

Diagnosis of Alzheimer's

There is no one test that can diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Doctors use a combination of physical examinations, medical history, and cognitive tests.

Brain imaging is also done to detect and identify changes in the brain that are associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia in general. The doctor may also carry other tests to rule out other causes of the changes you may have observed.

The doctor may recommend that a close relative or friend accompany the patient so they can provide the behavioural changes that they have observed.

Treatments options for Alzheimer's Disease

There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. For example, cholinesterase inhibitors and Memantine boost inter-cell communications, which is inhibited by Alzheimer’s. This improves the cognitive function of the patient. Further research is still ongoing on medications that can slow down its progression.

If you suspect that your loved one may have Alzheimer's disease, have them assessed by a doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis will help you start treatment and take measures to assist and protect them.

For example, you may need to modify the house arrangements to improve their safety, and to assign a caregiver to help them during episodes of disorientation.

"#HeartHealthDay: Coronary artery disease symptoms, causes, and treatment","Coronary artery disease happens when the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) become narrowed by plaque build-up. Plaque is made up of cholesterol and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the coronary arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.

Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease. It is also the leading cause of death around the world.

There are two forms of coronary artery disease:

1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is divided into unstable angina (chest pain at rest with increasing intensity over time), NSTEMI (a type of heart attack that involves part of the innermost layers of tissue of the heart, and the second layer of tissues of the heart), and STEMI (where the entire heart wall is involved in the heart attack).

ACS describes a range of conditions associated with the sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. ACS happens when the plaque in your coronary arteries rupture or tear open. This can cause a blood clot to form. The blood clot can then block the flow of blood to your heart muscles.

2. Chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) which includes stable angina (chest pain on exertion)

This is a more gradual form of coronary artery disease. CAD happens when the plaque in your coronary arteries slowly builds up over time (which could take years). This can lead to narrowing of the arteries, which can eventually restrict blood flow to your heart.

Coronary artery disease has many causes:

Atherosclerosis: This is the most common cause of coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis happens when plaque builds up in your arteries. Over time, this plaque can harden and narrow your arteries.Smoking increases the risks of coronary artery disease development although it is not a cause in itself.CoronaryvasospasmCoronaryemboli (rare)Arterioscrerosis (an inflammation of the walls of the coronary vessels)

Coronary artery disease symptoms

Angina is chest pain or discomfort when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It's a common symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD). It feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under your breastbone. Angina pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.

The other significant sign of coronary artery disease is a heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction. When plaque build-up becomes severe, it can restrict blood flow and cause a heart attack.

Symptoms associated with a heart attack include chest pain, discomfort in the arms or shoulders, shortness of breath, and nausea. A heart attack can cause permanent damage to your heart or even be fatal.

What increases the risk of coronary artery disease?

Coronary artery disease is a complex condition with many different risk factors. Some of the most common risk factors include:

Physically inactive lifestyle.Family history: If you have a family history of heart disease, you are more likely to develop CAD.Smoking: Smoking is one of the most important risk factors for CAD. Cigarette smoke damages the lining of your arteries and makes plaque more likely to form.High blood pressure: High blood pressure puts extra stress on your heart and can damage your arteries.High cholesterol: High cholesterol can narrow your arteries and increase your risk for heart disease.Diabetes: Diabetes can damage your blood vessels and increase your risk for CAD.Obesity: Obesity increases your risk for CAD, high blood pressure, and diabetes.Stress: Stress can contribute to the development of CAD.Eating junk/ unhealthy foods.

What are the complications of coronary artery disease?

Coronary artery disease can lead to a number of complications, including:

Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to your heart is blocked. This can cause permanent damage to your heart or even be fatal.Angina: Angina is chest pain or discomfort when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.Arrhythmias: Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that can be dangerous.Heart failure: Heart failure occurs when your heart cannot pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.Sudden cardiac death: This is an abrupt, unexpected death from a heart problem.

How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?

Coronary artery disease is usually diagnosed with a combination of tests, including:

Medical history and physical exam: Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms and perform a physical exam.Blood tests can help diagnose CAD by checking for high cholesterol or diabetes.Stress test: A stress test is a type of exercise test that can help diagnose CAD.Electrocardiogram and echocardiogramChest X-rayCoronary angiography and MRI scan

How is coronary artery disease treated?

Treatment for coronary artery disease usually starts with lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, exercising, and eating a healthy diet. Medications and, in some cases, surgery may be needed to treat CAD.

What can you do to prevent coronary artery disease?

Prevention is always better than cure. This is especially true regarding coronary heart disease, as this condition can be debilitating and even life-threatening.

One can prevent coronary heart disease through life changes such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking.

Exercise helps to keep your heart and blood vessels healthy, and a healthy diet will help to lower your cholesterol levels.

If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your heart health. In addition to these lifestyle changes, you should also see your doctor regularly for check-ups.

Separating myths from facts: The truth about vasectomy,"“My wife has been on contraceptives since we started having children. Now that they are adults I have decided to undergo vasectomy and free her from contraceptives.” This is what a man identified as Kamau told the media after undergoing vasectomy at the National Theatre during the 2016 World Vasectomy Day. Kamau can be considered bold and brave because most men in Kenya do not embrace vasectomy.

Data from the Economic Survey 2020 shows that in 2019, 658 men underwent vasectomy, in 2018, the number was 646 while in 2016, the number was 919. This is in contrast to over 2.5 million women who took family planning injections in 2019 alone.

What is it?

Vasectomy, also known as male sterilisation, is a procedure that is performed on ductus deferens. “The ductus deferens, also known as vas deferens, is a thick-walled tube found in the male reproductive system. The tube transports sperm cells from the sperm storage facility known as epididymis,” says Dr. Patrick Hiuhu, a physician. He explains that during a vasectomy, the tubes are cut or sealed to prevent sperm from passing through to the urethra for ejaculation during intercourse.

Advances in medical engineering have made the process easier to conduct. According to Dr. Charles Ochieng, the founder of Family Health Options Kenya, you don’t always have to undergo the scalpel. “The alternative procedure uses spray anaesthesia and takes about ten minutes. The tubes are accessed using equipment known as the ring clamp,” said Dr. Ochieng.

After vasectomy, it takes between one and two weeks for an incision to completely heal. Dr. Janet Brito, a certified sex therapist and co-author of Integrative Sex & Couples Therapy says that vasectomy doesn’t change the feeling or sensation during intimacy. “Most men are afraid that the sensation of orgasm is different after vasectomy. It is not. Neither is the quality or amount of semen,” she says.

Sex and vasectomy

Ejaculating ‘dry air’ is one of the commonly peddled myths about vasectomy and sex. Truth is that vasectomy has no impact on sexual performance, orgasm, sexual desire, ejaculation, and erectile capabilities. However, it can take up to three months after undergoing vasectomy before one can start having unprotected sex. The break is to allow your sperm count to reduce to zero. “After vasectomy, you will get clinical appointments at between 6 to 12 weeks to analyse if there is any sperm left in your semen before you can start engaging in unprotected sex,” says Dr. Hiuhu. This means that in the weeks after undergoing vasectomy, you will need to use protection during intercourse because your semen may still contain sperm that could be potent enough to cause pregnancy.

Is it reversible?

Vasectomy is a reversible mode of family planning. According to urologist Dr. Sarah Vij, the success rate of a vasectomy reversal will mainly depend on the time that has elapsed since the procedure was done. Where a reversal procedure is done within the first ten years, chances of success are as high as 95 percent. From 15 years and above, the rate of success declines significantly.

Does vasectomy cause prostate cancer?

According to medical research of 42,000 men aged 40 and above who had undergone vasectomy in the United States, there is no link between vasectomy and the onset of fatal prostate cancer. The result of this medical research by the American Cancer Society was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2016. The research also found that men who undergo vasectomy do not have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. If they get prostate cancer, they are not more likely to die from it than men who don’t undergo vasectomy. Men who’d want to lower their risk of fatal prostate cancer need to maintain a healthy weight and quit smoking, which is associated with a high risk of fatal prostate cancer,” said Dr. Eric Jacobs, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society who led this research.

"Men are avoiding the doctor, can that be changed?","Studies show that, compared to women, men are less likely to visit a doctor for regular checkups, or when something is not right.

Healthcare workers report having to send family members to persuade their male relatives to visit the hospital.

What could be behind men’s poor health-seeking behavior?

Can anything be done to convince them that a visit to the doctor is good for them?

Why they choose to stay away

When asked why they avoid hospitals and doctors in general, most men say they believe they will get better on their own. This can be interpreted as either overblown confidence in themselves or downplaying the gravity of a possible illness. Experts theorise this as the superhero syndrome at play. Most men consider falling ill a sign of vulnerability and weakness. They believe people will perceive them as weak if they visit a doctor.

Some doctors believe men stay away from hospitals because of the fear of bad news. A typical man would rather take painkillers for life for migraine than being informed that they have a tumor.

Men also fear “shameful feedback” about sensitive issues such as fertility and erectile dysfunction. This makes many opt to solve the problem on their own by taking supplements or even blaming their partners for their woes.

Finally, it is also possible that men are afraid of some diagnostic and treatment procedures. For example, colonoscopy and tests for prostrate can be quite uncomfortable.

The cost of avoiding doctors

Many lifestyle diseases have ‘silent symptoms’ which can only be detected through regular checkups. Therefore, by avoiding doctors, men rob themselves of the chance of an early diagnosis.

Late diagnosis means an illness has advanced, sometimes irreversibly or the patient may have to undergo expensive and intensive treatments.

This mentality could also harm dependents who are in the care of men. A man who can’t book checkup appointments for himself is unlikely to make such arrangements for others.

These men may also expect their sons and other male relatives to toughen up and dissuade them from going to the hospital often.

Getting men to see the doctor

Here are some suggestions:

Offer discounts for people who go for checkups with their partners

Many men have reported going to a doctor just to get their partners to stop nagging. With such an incentive, many women will persuade their partners to see a doctor.

Sensitize men on need for checkups

Some researchers have suggested that women go for checkups more often because they understand their health better than men. Campaigns to sensitize men on the need for checkups could improve their perception of doctor visits.

Male medical personnel for reluctant patients

Men who consider going to the doctor as emasculating are also unlikely to disclose all their medical information. However, they are usually open to older male doctors because they perceive them as qualified and experienced.

Final words

Although millennial men have shown more enthusiasm towards seeking medical attention, compared to men of older generations, there is still a gap that calls for efforts towards changing men’s mindsets about seeking healthcare.

Getting pregnant after 40 – what you should know,"After 40, the chances of conceiving decrease significantly.

However, with tailored advice and tips, conceiving after 40 is not impossible.

What to expect

Being pregnant at an older age can take a toll on your body in different ways.  Body aches and pains are common side-effects of being pregnant.

A successful pregnancy at this age comes with increased risks of certain medical conditions. Consult your doctor to see if you’re susceptible to any medical challenges.

Psychologically, prepare for change. For example, when many women are pregnant at an older age, they feel exhausted. Mental stability is important so always take care of your mental health.

Problems you may encounter

Diminished ovarian reserve: This is a condition in which the ovary loses its normal reproductive potential, leading to decreased chances of getting pregnant because of reduced fertility.Treatment challenges: Infertility treatments are more expensive and less effective as a woman gets older. This can lead to emotional stress, which can contribute to pregnancy complications.Increased risk of miscarriage: The risk of miscarriage is relatively higher with age. This is because when a low-quality egg is produced and fertilized, it is difficult for the embryo to develop well, causing miscarriage.

Increasing your chances of conception

Older women can get pregnant naturally. It may just take a little more time. However, some practices can help improve fertility and the chances of a successful pregnancy.

Prenatal exercises will increase your chances of carrying a baby to term. Exercising also eases the pain of childbirth.Consume a healthy diet with plenty of protein. Additionally, take prenatal vitamins to prepare for pregnancy.Use Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). The most common procedure of ART is IVF. Using In vitro fertilization (IVF), eggs are removed from the ovaries and mixed with sperm outside the body. Seek professional advice before undergoing this procedure.Practice a healthy lifestyle, including eating well, exercising, and limiting alcohol intake. Alcohol is a common cause of infertility.Keep stress levels down. Cortisol, a stress hormone, can disrupt the coordination of the brain and the ovaries, which affects ovulation.Use natural supplements. Consult an expert for advice on what supplements will work for your specific context.

Benefits of getting pregnant after 40

1. Financial stability

Generally, the older you are, the more stable your finances become. Being pregnant at an older age gives you time to save money on childcare, a mortgage, or other necessary expenses.

2. Emotional stability

Pregnancy can cause unexpected emotional changes and mood swings. However, older women can control their emotions better than younger women.

3. Disciplined children

Children raised by older parents tend to do well academically and have good discipline. Studies have also shown that children raised by older parents are more likely to be successful.

"I'm unable to have children, so my husband wants another wife","Q: I have been married for the last six years. My husband and I do not have children. I have tried every intervention, including medical. I feel so devastated by this. Some months ago my husband told me that he really wants children and the only option is to marry another wife. He assured me of his love even after his second union. I feel more pain now. I love him and I really want him happy. If children will add to his happiness I will be happy too. He has a right to marry because it is within the law. Now how do I deal with this? Please help me.

-----

A: Understandably, this is a very difficult scenario that you are facing. There’s the fact that you cannot bear children – and now you have the added pain of a potential second wife. I empathise with you. Just as he said, he has the right to do so, but at the same time, you know this will cause you great pain. So, it is important to note that the feelings you are having while thinking about his options are perfectly normal.

If he does chose to go ahead with this, at least you are clear on his reasons why: it is not because he loves you any less or values you any less, but because of his natural desire to have children. This reasoning will help you not be hard on yourself, thinking that you have done something wrong or that you are inadequate for him.

You now need a candid conversation about the way forward once he gets his new love. Let him know that he still has the same obligations to take care of you and love you in the way he always has. He is obliged to treat you both equally. So, even though you might be sharing your time, he must still give you the same level of attention and affection.

From your letter, your husband clearly understands that it would be difficult for you and that must be the reason why he respected you enough to ask you about it first and involve you rather than just going about it behind your back. You can take this as a positive sign that he loves and cares for you very much. My best wishes.

Can FGM be a personal choice?,"Rose, a farmer from the outskirts of Nairobi, came to the sexology clinic to enquire if she could be circumcised. Female circumcision, also called female genital mutilation (FGM) or female genital cutting (FGC), is outlawed in Kenya.

“There is a court case going on where the petitioner wants adult women allowed their rights to decide whether to get circumcised or not in registered hospitals,” she explained. “I just want to know if you will circumcise me once the case goes through.” Rose was referring to a court case in which a female doctor has challenged the Kenya anti-FGM law.

I reclined in my seat, agape. It was the strangest request I had received in many days. I composed myself and took to understanding my patient’s request through a detailed medical history. Rose was 35 years old. She was married and had four children. She did not have any medical or sexual problem.

“The parents of my husband have never fully accepted me, though” she explained. “They value female circumcision and know that I am not circumcised.” Rose was afraid her father-in-law would disinherit her husband because of this.

I asked why female circumcision was such a big deal in this family. According to Rose, an uncircumcised woman was considered uncultured. Such a woman was considered a sexual disaster, tempting men to sleep with her. “There have been rumours that most likely, the children I have do not belong to one man!” Rose exclaimed. “Apparently, in my sexual craziness I could have conceived with other men.”

Rose was always left out of important family meetings because discussions were said to be for ‘mature’ women; Rose was classified as a girl, not a woman. Her husband had supported her all along, but of late he seemed to be warming up to the idea of marrying a second circumcised woman to reduce pressure from his father.

I concluded that Rose’s issue was a case of an oppressed, ostracised and stigmatised person accepting her status and working towards being integrated into a society that had rejected her. I realised that many women could also be in this state. Such women also fear for their daughters. Such pressures put three million girls at risk of undergoing FGM every year.

The ethical and moral question is whether communities and families should peg a woman’s status on the cut. “Well, that is what our community wants,” Rose insisted, “and if you allow me to do it then I will bring my daughters too because we all have to conform.”

And that is the tragedy. The moment you give leeway for FGM to be practiced legally on adults you open a floodgate for perpetuating its harmful aspects. Being a traditional and cultural practice, it has a meaning that goes with a package of beliefs and practices. In communities that allow FGM, it defines a woman’s status. It also defines a woman’s sexual rights and disables her from making sexual choices. It is a package that defines what one has to accept and live with on making important choices such as marriage; you get circumcised then get married. Many children who have undergone FGM have dropped out of school for early marriages.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also dispelled the myth that FGM done in health facilities is safe. Irrespective of where it is done, WHO asserts that FGM causes pain, bleeding, infection, infertility, painful sex and many other complications including death. From a medical perspective therefore, FGM is an unprofessional practise which should result in disciplinary action.

“What? So you mean you will not do the cut on me?” Rose frowned. I nodded. What is urgently needed is conversations at community level, with families, on the need to open space for the girl child to achieve her potential and allow women to enjoy their rights. Reversing the gains already made in women’s rights by re-introducing practices such as FGM is defeatist and against the international development agenda.

“Okay doctor, I suggest you tell that to my father in law,” Rose said, standing to leave.

“I will write about it in my newspaper column. Buy the newspaper and give it to him,” I replied, to which she nodded, hurrying out of the consultation room.

What should I do to make my wife let me access her phone?,"Q: I have been married for nine years. My main problem is my wife’s phone, which she won’t let me access. She has locked it with a password, which I have tried to ask her to unlock, but she won’t. Is she hiding something? I have a password on my phone because of the sensitive work documents I have in it – and as you know, the husband is the head of the home. She is my wife; she shouldn’t have that password in the first place. What should I do to make her let me have access to her phone? We had an argument over this and it is creating distance between us.

-----

A: From the way you phrase yourself, one can tell that there are issues in this marriage beyond the password problem. You think it is okay to protect your phone because you are the man of the house and your wife needn’t know your business; but when your wife does the same you accuse her of hiding things and demand access because you are the husband? Why would you lock yours and want her to open hers? We all get back what we give.

Please know that marriage feels safest when there is full transparency from both partners. True intimacy is built on a shared trust and respect that requires vulnerability. Also remember that you are equal partners in your marriage, and that you are both human beings who feel the same pain and frustrations.

You say that she may be hiding information from you. This might be true – but she may be innocent and simply locking her phone because you are locking yours. Either way, this is an issue that you both need to handle as it is creating a lot of mistrust, and no marriage that can survive a lack of trust. You need to be open and honest in your communication. It is therefore key you have a talk and express to her how this affects your feelings of safety and trust in the relationship.

While you may not know what she is doing on her phone, you do know that she is guarding a part of her life from you, which creates the lack of trust. As you discuss, I suggest that you talk with her clearly about your need to feel safely connected to her in the union.

Please do not focus on WHAT she may be hiding, as that speculation will only create more distance between you. In case she tells you that she locks her phone because you also do the same, then you either leave your phone locked and drop the issue forever, or let her have access to yours as well.

Erectile dysfunction can be linked to serious health problems,"The first time Alice came to the sexology clinic, she did not want to see a doctor. She asked at the reception if she could buy Viagra. The receptionist advised her to talk to the doctor but she refused and walked away. A week later she was back. This time round she agreed to see me.

“I know what am looking for,” she explained. “I have not had sex with my husband for two years because he can’t stand to the occasion. I just want Viagra to sort that out. I nodded understandingly, looking for an avenue to strike a rapport before we could go into details of Viagra and ED.

Alice was 48 years old. She was a journalist married to James, a 55-year-old high school teacher. The couple had been married for 19 years and had three children, the youngest being 12 years old. They had had a blissful marital life till James’ erections started dwindling. Because he was embarrassed, he opted to avoid sex altogether.

Understanding erectile dysfunction | Your World

Alice was unhappy with his decision. She tried to get him to go for treatment but he would hear nothing of that. This is why she wanted Viagra. Unfortunately for a problem as important as ED, a complete medical evaluation has to be made. I had a long chat with Alice after which I decided to talk to her husband on phone. James was difficult to convince.

“You have actually teamed up with my wife to talk about my private life?!” he snapped. After a lot of patience and persuasion from my end, he agreed to visit the clinic.

I did not hear from the couple for another three months, until a giant of a man walked into the clinic one morning and told me that he was James. He was not just tall, but also wide. After asking me a number of questions about my clinic, James finally opened up about how his erections had faded over time and his subsequent fight with his wife. He thought it was demeaning for a man to seek care for such problems.

On examining him, I found James to be obese. His weight was 150 kg. The right weight for his height was supposed to be 70 to 85 kg. His blood pressure was high. I ordered tests to assess his hormones, cholesterol and blood sugar. We agreed to meet in three days to review the results. Meanwhile, I prescribed anti-hypertensives.

The next day I received a call from Alice. She was weeping. James was no more. He had developed chest pains in the night and was rushed to hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. I followed up with the medical team in the hospital to understand the cause of death; he had had a heart attack.

Two days after James died I received the results of tests I had ordered. He had high cholesterol as well as sugar. James’s case showed that ED can be a symptom of serious health problems. In his case, obesity and undiagnosed high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar were the real problems; ED was the symptom. These abnormal changes in the body are a result of sedentary lifestyles. The changes ultimately result in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) epitomised by heart attack and stroke.

CVDs kill close to 18 million people every year worldwide. Most of these deaths happen in developing countries. Another big number of people live with varying forms of disability from the effects of these diseases.

In sexual medicine, ED has been identified as one of the warning sign of CVDs. Anybody who suffers ED should seek medical help and should be screened to ensure that they are not at risk of sudden death.

Alice came to the clinic after James was buried. She wanted to understand more. “Do you think I stressed him so much that his heart failed?” she asked, tears welling up her eyes.

I explained that she was right to insist he seeks medical attention. However James took too long to do so and just when we were about to diagnose his problem, he passed on. Alice broke down and cried uncontrollably. Overcome by emotion, she walked out of the clinic. She was still in the early stages of mourning and I realised my explanation only caused her more pain.

Prepare financially for your newborn with these tips,"While the arrival of a newborn baby is exciting for many families, the bundle of joy comes with additional financial responsibilities.

Planning for your child's needs such as education and healthcare can seem daunting. Luckily, there are ways to prepare financially before the birth of your baby.

Have an emergency fund

You may have already purchased a crib and clothes for your new arrival. But, there are many other things you'll need before and after the baby arrives.

Save up in an emergency fund in order to have a cushion in case unforeseen issues arise while you're pregnant or during delivery.

Life insurance

This is an excellent time to invest in life insurance for yourself and your children. Ensure your children have some form of financial protection in case something happens to you, especially when they are still minors.

Prepare a will

It is important to prepare a will before the baby arrives. A will prevents any confusion that would arise among family members should anything happen to you.

If you have a will already, adjust it to include your newborn baby. For instance, most parents want their property inherited by their kids. You can assign a guardian to take care of the children and the assets until they reach the legal age.

Acquire a health insurance plan

Everyone has a personal financial pulse. It is advisable to check various insurance policies to see which suits your budget while catering to your needs.

The benefit of getting health insurance before the baby arrives is that you will be covered for prenatal care and delivery.

You could also choose a plan which includes pediatrician visits, prescriptions, dental care, and even vision services. The premiums might increase after childbirth but it is worth paying the increased fee because of the added advantages.

Organize your finances

Many parents-to-be worry about their personal finances and whether they'll be able to afford all their baby's needs.

A good idea is to create a budget with realistic estimates.

Sort out assets and liabilities. Assets include cash at hand, savings, property like real estate, investments such as stocks. Liabilities include loans, monthly bills, and expenses.

Shop early for the baby

Early shopping will help you stick to your budget. Having a variety to choose from and purchasing products at a discount are a few of the benefits of shopping early.

You can also ask for advice from people who have had children before, on where to get the best bargains.

Nanny hunting

If you are planning to work or look for a job during and after pregnancy, it is important that the nanny has all necessary qualifications such as experience with babies. It is also wise to ask for copies of their personal identification documents.

Looking for a nanny early ensures that you have enough time to do a thorough search and get one within your budget.

In conclusion

Financially preparing for a baby is imperative to the child's well-being and your peace of mind.

The family should have insurance and a clear budget before baby arrives to ensure they are able to provide for the child without going into debt or taking on too much guilt as parents.

On the edge: What triggers persistent genital arousal disorder?,"Rose was in distress when she walked into my consultation room. She introduced herself then went quiet for about five minutes. To break the ice, I asked how I could help her. She raised her head, looked me straight in the eye, and then looked down again. Then, all of a sudden, she started crying uncontrollably. I gave her time to cool down. Sex problems are difficult. Very many people suffer quietly and lack the strength to go for treatment. I therefore congratulated Rose for taking the first step and reassured her that I would do my best to help, whatever it was.

“Sorry, I have just had orgasm and was unable to keep talking. It made me feel horrible that it happened right here in front of you,” she explained. Rose was 35 and a single mother of two. She was a lawyer running her private law firm in the middle of town. “Give me medicine to reduce my libido,” she pleaded. “I am unable to concentrate on my work. I feel like my genitals are in total control of my life.”

After evaluating Rose’s situation, I concluded that she did not have high libido. High libido is synonymous with excessive desire for sex. It is characterised by sex fantasies and a general desire for the act. Sexual experiences resulting from high libido are enjoyable. On the other hand, Rose was always on edge, feeling like she would have orgasm any time.

I made a diagnosis of persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD). PGAD is basically an abnormality of the nerve supply to the genitals. The nerves that cause sexual stimulation fire signals without control. This activity has no connection to the usual sex cycle, which is normally linked to intimacy and starts with foreplay.

Symptoms include abnormal excitement which makes one feel as if they are going to climax any time. The disorder almost exclusively affects women. On the rare occasion that a man is affected, they suffer priapism – a non-resolving erection of the penis.

Affected women may have sex with the hope of relieving the feeling but it may not go away. A number of cases present to the clinic for masturbating too much, feeling guilty and thinking that masturbation is the cause rather than the effect of their medical problem.

There are triggers which exacerbate it PGAD such as tight underpants, tampons, sitting down, driving on a rough road or riding a bicycle. Anything that exerts pressure or causes vibration around the genitals worsens the condition.

Affected individuals feel helpless, frustrated and depressed, and may even attempt suicide. They are unable to cope with their body demands as well as demands of work or in social cycles. They isolate themselves, feel stigmatised and become loners, eventually sliding into depression.

“But surely doctor what brings such an unfair condition?” Rose lamented.

The abnormal nerve signals to the genitals can result from problems with the brain or spinal cord. They can also result from local nerve or blood system problems. In some cases, the condition is a side effect of some medicines. In other cases it is a consequence of surgical treatment in the genital areas, interfering with nerve or blood functions to the genitals. In other words, PGAD is not to be taken lightly. Affected people must undergo thorough medical tests to determine the cause. Sometimes, though, the cause is not easy to find.

The cause of Rose’s case was unclear. She was put on a combination of treatment targeting the highly likely causes. It took months before some relief was realised. Two years later today, at least Rose is able to function among her peers and in her social space. However she is still on medication and this will not change unless signs clearly show that she is fully recovered.

Case Number Zero - An introduction,"

Bogonko Bosire went missing in September 2013. He disappeared as the International Criminal Court cases against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy, William Ruto, were hitting a crescendo.

This is the story of who he was, and where his friends think he may be.

Let’s talk! Confronting the age-old problem of sexual harassment,"Early February, 23-year-old Esther*, started her two-month internship at a broadcast media company in Nairobi.

She is a Media and Communication student at a local university where she majored in electronic media. Two weeks into her internship, the company’s head of production, a male in his early 30s, started making unwelcome sexual moves on her.

“Every time, he was around me, he could tell me I have a nice body and that he could not wait to have me in his bed,” she shares.

“At first, I laughed it off. But the comments kept coming. He could call me in the middle of the night and tell me how he missed me, yet he and I were in the office, the whole time.”

This went on for about a week until she felt it was about time to make it clear that she wasn’t interested in his sex innuendos.

Incidentally, both had plans to confront each other on the same day. She arrived at the office, ready to speak her mind, only for him to come to her desk, grab her hand and pull her to an outdoor garden.

“I want to have sex with you. So when is that happening?” he asked her.

Esther says she was shocked by his outright demand.

“I told him I respect myself so much that I cannot sleep with him for just a night and walk away like nothing happened,” she says.

From then, he started avoiding her and could not assign her any roles. She spent sleepless nights wondering what her next move should be, having been cut off from gaining practical experience. She reached out to a female colleague.

It is a small-scale company with less than 10 employees, she says.

Her response was even more depressing: “He is known for that behaviour and there is nothing you can do. We don’t have guidelines on who to report to when that happens. Just let it go.”

It was until she threatened to tell his wife of his unprofessional behaviour that he changed and resumed treating her professionally – sending her out for assignments and according her the necessary support in line of duty.

Esther’s experience is a definitive example of quid pro quo harassment, a form of sexual harassment in which employment decisions are made based on an employee’s acceptance or rejection of unwelcome sexual behaviour. In this case, the head of department withdrawing his supervisory role on her because she declined his demand for sexual relations.

Available evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other.

Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Sexual harassment is not limited to office space. It happens everywhere – from formal to informal interactions; in the online and offline spaces.

It happens on social media, markets, supermarkets, gyms, hotels, salons, tea buying centres, churches, banking halls or on the road as one heads to the shop or the river. The list is long.

In Kenya, sexual harassment is a criminal offence. Clause 23 of the Sexual Offences Act (2006) prohibits any person in authority or holding a public office from making sexual advances or requests. Such a person is liable to a minimum three-year jail term or penalty of not less than Sh100,000.

The Act further criminalises other forms of sexual harassment such as sexual assault, attempted rape and indecent acts. These offences attract a five to a 10-year jail term.

Busia Woman Representative Ms Florence Mutua had through her Sexual Offences (Amendment), 2016 sought to further specify forms of sexual harassment.

She wanted “any contact between any part of the body of a person with the genital organs, breasts or buttocks of another …and exposure or display (of the same) or pornographic material to any person against his or her will,” to be criminalised. The bill failed to get the legislators’ approval.

On the other hand, previously under the Employment Act (2007), only companies with more than 20 employees were bound by law to have a sexual harassment policy.

But now, the Employment (Amendment) Act, 2019, demands of firms with more than five employees to have the policy. It should clearly state that each employee is entitled to employment that is free of sexual harassment, how to report the offences and redress measures thereof.

Despite the existence of anti-sexual harassment laws, the reality of women and men becoming victims is evident.

Scanty statistics are available on offline sexual harassment. The media has, however, captured such cases. For instance, last year, a police officer in Nakuru was caught on camera pulling a suspect’s genitals in an attempt to force him to board a waiting police vehicle.

For online, studies on digital security have shown prevalence of sexual harassment. A 2016 joint survey by Association of Media Women in Kenya (Amwik) and Article 19 Eastern Africa established that some 75 per cent of female journalists in Kenya have suffered online harassment, these included sexual harassment.

Available evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other, an indication of either the public’s ignorance or disillusionment.

It is possible to successfully litigate a sexual harassment offence.

In 2017, a Kericho Employment and Labour Relations court awarded a female clinical officer Sh600,000 as general damages for sexual harassment. In case 53 of 2017, the officer had sued her manager for sexual advances. She declined, a decision she argued to have prompted him to end her employment at the health facility.

Diamond Trust Bank, Head of HR Ms Lillian Ngala, says a human resource officer is obliged to take action against claims of sexual harassment.

Ignoring the complaints

The aggrieved member of the staff must, however, provide proof to the claim, which can be in form of emails, calls, texts or colleagues to whom one has confided.

Ignoring the complaints could be tantamount to abetting sexual harassment in the workplace, a conduct that can lead to one losing certificate of practice with Institute of Human Resource Management, she says.

She observes that annual sensitisation of staff through strategies such as refresher courses and email reminders, are crucial to eliminating breeding ground for sexual harassment.

Eagle HR Consultants Chief Executive Officer, Mr Patrick Mutisya, adds that an employee has a right to seek justice through the court if the employer fails to take action within 14 days of notice.

“The person who fails to take action is actually a collaborator (in abetting the offence),”says Mr Mutisya.

But to successfully prosecute such as case, one needs to provide concrete evidence such as an email or a letter, he advises.

Federation of Women Lawyers-Kenya (Fida-Kenya) Legal Counsel, Ms Vivian Mwende says “when it comes to sexual harassment, the burden of proof lies with the person who is claiming sexual harassment.”

Labour Policy Consultant at Learn Africa Solutions, Mr Alphonce Were says employers must purpose to educate their employees to avoid normalising sexual harassment.

“Employees should be aware that sexual statements about their body parts are not normal jokes,” he says.

This is my story...Sabina Chege

In March 2018, Murang’a Woman Representative Ms Sabina Chege, found herself in the middle of a storm.

An alleged conman, Benson Chacha was using her number to solicit money from Cabinet Secretaries and her fellow MPs in addition to sending the MPs sexually explicit messages.

Ms Chege together with 13 other female MPs reported the harassment to Parliament Police Station. When Directorate of Criminal Investigations, director Mr George Kinoti appeared before the National Assembly Committee on National Security to shed light on investigations of the matter, he said he had concluded that “there is special relation between the complainants and the suspect.”

This opened the floor for online sexual harassment against Ms Chege with a Twitter account even opened using her photo and that of the suspect, and using an implicating username. The account is still active to-date.

Later, the DCI refuted the “special relation” statement but the damage was already done on the part of Ms Chege.

The harassment was “a worst case scenario,” Ms Chege says.

“It is really sad even the way the police handled the matter. We are still in court. The court has delayed the case till to-day. If somebody at my level can be treated that way, what about an ordinary woman?” she wonders.

For nominated Member of the Nairobi County Assembly Ms Silvia Museiya, being spammed with sexually suggestive conversations on her phone and social media accounts is common.

“I just ignore,” she says, “The moment you start indulging, it becomes a back and forth issue. There is an assumption that women in leadership have used sex to get up, and so the best way to handle it is to prove that you have a mind of your own, and that you are confident in your own space, and men can read that very easily.”

Unsafe behind the wheel: An Uber driver and her ‘sexual advances’ journey

Women taxi drivers face the same security concerns as male drivers; however, they additionally face gender-dominated forms of victimisation.

Peris Wangari Wanjiku, an Uber driver, recalls a time she picked a client in Langa’ta who wanted to go to Kahawa West. On their way, Ms Wanjiku says the client, who had been talkative for most of the trip disclosed he had no place to go and requested her to spend the night with him in the car.

As an act of kindness, and to avoid a confrontation, she decided to park her car at a petrol station along Thika Road, the safest place she could think of, until dawn.

For her, working as a taxi driver in Nairobi has been the most enjoyable and rewarding form of employment but it has come with a fair share of challenges.

Ms Wanjiku says most of her male clients make sexual advances at her and it does not amuse her anymore because she knows how to handle such behaviour. Some ask her for a date, while others make uninvited remarks.

Many of her male clients, she reveals, start hitting on her the moment they start the journey. They will tell her how beautiful she is and request for a date.

On average, five out of every 10 male clients, she says, make sexual advances at her.This, she says, mostly happens at night when ferrying inebriated clients, with both young and old clients making unwelcome advances in equal measure.

“Many start telling me they want to take me for coffee and get to know me because they are having issues with either their girlfriends or wives. They will shower me with compliments, saying they like aggressive and hard-working women like me, and not their lazy wives and girlfriends,” she says.

Keen not to bring an argument or a misunderstanding in the course of their journey, Ms Wanjiku says she plays along and remains polite until they reach their destination. They then strike a deal that they talk over the phone the following day, as a gesture of politeness.

“Many of them will call the following day and that is when I tell them I am married and a family woman who is only in business to fend for my family,” she says.

One time, she says, she got a request from a man of Chinese origin. When they got to their destination, she says the Chinese man looked at her, gave her some extra money and told her to go home and cook for the children.

Ms Wanjiku reveals that in her kind of business, she can only be polite to the male clients lest she losses business. What she ensures is that she does not allow the advances to go beyond limits.

Despite the sexual advances, she says male clients are usually very friendly, generous and has never encountered a violent one.

A gym instructor, his female clients and the limits

The gym is a great place for rejuvenating the body and mind. It can, however, be an intimidating and daunting place, making one feel vulnerable.

Like many other environments, it is prone to sexual harassment with the most common types including being unnecessarily stared at, indecent touch, having one’s personal space invaded without invitation, and unnecessary comments about appearance.

The gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client.

The gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client. This is where the thin line between upholding professionalism and managing emotional attachment that comes with hours, weeks, months and even years of an instructor training one client comes in.

Studies show that women are the most sexually harassed in the gym, but men too, are prone to harassment.

Arnold Opuka*, a gym instructor in Kisumu, is alive to this fact. When we meet him at his place of work, he tells The Voice that he has also been a victim of sexual harassment.

Suggestive comments about their physique abound, with women referring to them as hunks, and suggesting which parts of their bodies the instructor should touch as they train.

""Many of these women, aged between 35 and 55 years, have money and easily influence young instructors. Some have fallen victims and lost their jobs,"" says Mr Opuka.

He reveals that the women are tactful, only giving glances with limited open expressions of their desire for someone. This, he says, requires a keen eye to notice the advances.

At times, especially during stretching exercises, some will do the routines suggestively.

He, however, reveals that the actual sexual advances happen during private sessions.

""The women are more open and tempt instructors by the manner in which they act around you,"" says the 31-year-old.

He adds that when these women come to the gym, their eyes are not only trained on the instructors, but also the young well-built men who work out in the gym.

While most of these incidences appear consensual, he maintains that it is wrong and can be avoided, warning his colleagues against according specific clients special attention as that is bound to build attachment.

""Women are a jealous lot and that is why you have to treat all of them equally. Smile with all, psyche and assist all, and above all, be professional,” says Mr Opuka.

How much is reasonable bride price? Lessons from Tana River man’s Sh7,"When Hussein Charo from Tana River County asked for only Sh7 as bride price in December last year, he did not only baffle his guests, he also scaled national news because the action defied popular practice of turning such occasions into income-generating activities.

This was the second time Charo acted “strangely”. When his first daughter got married, he asked only for prayer beads, saying he was more interested in his son-in-law’s integrity than wealth.

This behaviour raises questions about bride price. Why do we consider it mandatory? How does it affect the status of women relative to men in marriage? What is women’s say about it? How much is reasonable and how much is not? Who is the primary beneficiary?

Prospective children

The consideration takes the form of livestock, money, foodstuff, utensils, other material items and even labour, depending on the community. Two scholars, John S. Mbiti and Isaac Osabutey-Aguedze, aver that bride price was traditionally to cement inter-familial relationships, express gratitude for the girl’s upbringing, ‘compensate’ for the transferred labour, demonstrate the man’s willingness to enter into a marriage and signal his ability to take care of the wife and prospective children. The gifts were reminders of the maiden’s physical absence and signified her value to the maiden and marital families.

No one should begrudge individuals from continuing with the practice as the Constitution of Kenya embeds the right to one’s culture. The Marriage Act (2014) also recognises the practice but requires it to be only a token to formalise customary unions.

From a gender perspective, bride-price is a patriarchal relic that subjugates women. In the first instance, the negotiations are male affairs even though the subject matter is a woman.

In fact, the bride does not even share in the payment or have a say on how it is used. In the second, men paying it (some under duress) wait to recover their pound of flesh through dominance over their wives citing the power assigned to them by the bride price. This is evident in cases where men count their wives as part of their property.

Dysfunctional unions

In some communities, women are subjected to insults insinuating that their level of intelligence is equal to that of the animals paid for them! Also, the understanding that the bride price is recovered should the marriage break down puts pressure on women to tolerate dysfunctional unions to protect the parents from the imminent loss.

Bride price has today become so steep, it is basically a captive wealth generating activity for the bride’s family, technically the paternal side, and a burdensome tax on men. In many cases, the price is based on the bride’s level of formal education and career. The higher the two, the more the expectation, as evident in the October 2019 case in Meru where a man demanded Sh1 million, to the chagrin of the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders, which in turn vowed to draft a law standardising the payment in their area of jurisdiction.

An anecdote from one nuptial experience has it that a medical doctor went to pay bride price for his partner, also a doctor. But the father-in-law made it clear that the amount paid was not commensurate with his daughter’s status. The groom apologised but gave his father-in-law a piece of poetic justice. He asked him to replace her with one equivalent to his means!

Nuptial ceremonies

Simply put, placing a price on a bride commercialises marriage, objectifies women and transforms them into wares for sale, in the same way as done in ancient Russia where they were called Kunka, derived from Kuna (marten), the currency of payment.

A cursory look reveals that nuptial ceremonies today are more of exhibitions of financial, material and vehicular grandeur than anything else. This is evident in comments equating success with the number of guests and expensive cars in attendance. This not only puts pressure on men, it also diverts attention from the primary purpose of marriage.

From the deep entrenchment of the practice, any suggestion to outlaw it would be opposed by both men and women, the former because this would disrobe them of power and the latter because it is probably the only expression of appreciation they and their parents are assured of.

Gender equality

Mr Charo’s action, comical as it looks, is a reminder that we should re-examine bride price in light of gender equality. Standardising the payment might appear like interference with personal choice.

However, it will return some sanity and redeem the practice from the financially draining monster it has become. It is also time we replaced the term ‘bride price’ with ‘gifts’ to remove the commercial connotation. The Njuri Ncheke also owes us an update on the draft law.

"Like Scotland, Kenya can end period poverty","Menstruation is an uncomfortable, painful, inconvenient and expensive experience for many women and girls. It occurs once a month for approximately three to seven days; about three months a year.

Those with no access to menstruation products are left to their own devices to manage their menstruation cycles, with many unable to participate meaningfully in daily life due to the difficulty of managing bleeding.

Many girls resort to using unhygienic substitutes such as rags, newspapers, banana leaves, and even cow dung. Worse still, others turn to prostitution to get these essential products.

Unfortunately, period poverty – the lack of access to menstrual products – increases the risk of toxic shock syndrome, cervical cancer and other dangerous infections according to research.

While period poverty has always been the stark reality for some, Covid-19 has exacerbated menstruation-related challenges, especially for women and girls from urban slums and poor rural communities.

Menstrual hygiene

Globally, women and girls’ rights activists are asking governments to integrate sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls in Covid-19 responses. In Kenya, at least 2.6 million girls currently require menstrual hygiene materials – pads, underwear and soap, according to Unesco.

In April last year, local women rights organisations petitioned the government to spend at least 30 per cent share of Covid-19 funds on gender responsive strategies including distributing cash relief, food and sanitary towels to vulnerable women and girls.

The pandemic aside, the menstrual hygiene situation in Kenya has been, and remains dire. Thousands of adolescent girls have to contend with hurdles as they go through formal schooling. In September last year, a school girl in Bomet committed suicide after her teacher humiliated her for staining her uniform during her menses.

It is sad this happened nine years after Kenya launched the Sanitary Towels Programme in 2011 – an initiative meant to provide pads to needy girls in public schools. It is the same year Kenya made sanitary towels tax-free.

Unfortunately, some girls do not receive the free sanitary towels. The government in 2019, admitted a lack of funds to provide sanitary towels as required by law, with Education CS George Magoha saying the Sh470 million provided can only supply girls for four months.

Lack of access to sanitary products means many girls drop out of school while on their period, putting them at greater risk of child marriage and early pregnancy.

In 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Basic Education Amendment Act (2016) placing the responsibility of providing free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels on the government, to reduce the number of girls missing school.

In 2019, the government launched the Menstrual Hygiene Policy 2019-30 to among other things, ensure women and girls have access to safe and hygienic products.

All these measures were aimed at ending period poverty. However, that goal is yet to be met with Education CS last year admitting that the government scheme had not met its target, and many girls are still missing school during their menses.

Disadvantaged girl

The United Nations estimates that as many as 20 million girls drop out of schools (globally) every year because they cannot deal with their menstrual flows. The Education ministry estimates that a girl absent from school for four days a month loses 13 learning days equivalent to two weeks per term.

This means that in an academic year, a disadvantaged girl loses up to 39 learning days, something that could be remedied by proper implementation of the sanitary towels program.

Access to sanitary products would also be of limited help if schools don’t have the supporting infrastructure, such as separate bathrooms for girls with doors and locks for privacy, a luxury in most of our rural public schools.

Menstruation is a global issue and there is evidence of action to address its challenges. Last year, Scotland became the first country in the world to provide free period products for all women, while Germany reduced tax on sanitary towels from 19 per cent to seven per cent.

Canada, Australia and India followed suit. France, Spain, Poland and Austria have also lowered tax on sanitary products. A handful of US States have also passed laws mandating free period products be provided in schools. The UK government too, rolled out free period products in all primary and secondary schools in England last year.

Kenya’s menstrual policies all look good on paper, but wouldn’t work in a real-world environment if not managed well. With proper management, we too, like Scotland, can make sanitary products free for all. Every woman is entitled to safe and hygienic menstrual facilities, and the right to manage menstruation without shame or stigma.

It is time to change the narrative, girls and women have suffered enough.

"From the US to Lesotho, Covid-19 crushed women's hopes as global supply chains came tumbling down","In her last weeks working the freight shift at the local J.C. Penney store, Alexandra Orozco took out her phone and hit record. The 22-year-old shot a video of the giant black-and-red ’Everything Must go!” posters, and posted it on TikTok in October.

“Slowly losing my job,” she wrote below, days before the store in Delano, California shut for good, one of 156 J.C. Penney stores across the United States to close since June of last year.

Since being laid off, she has applied for a couple of roles – counselling kids, delivering flowers – but has yet to hear back. “It’s so sad,” she explains over the phone.

“And it’s hard to find jobs here.”

Halfway across the world, Matefo Litali experienced upheaval, too. A skilled sewer, the 53-year-old worked at Tzicc Clothing, apparel-maker for US-based giants J.C. Penney and Walmart, in Lesotho, a small mountainous country surrounded by South Africa. She was employed for two months before nationwide lock-down measures forced all garment factories to temporarily close in March. After two days back at work, Tzicc confirmed her last day was May 7, 2020.

“I felt powerless,” she says.

“The first thing that went through my mind was, ‘Why me?” Neither woman has met. Nor are they likely to; one lives in a remote agricultural town on the west coast of America, the other 10,000 miles away in Southern Africa.

Supply chains

Now, both of their lives – and livelihoods – are linked by a global pandemic that has crushed one of the world’s supply chains and with it, economies, too.

Covid-19 lock-downs have obliterated a retail sector already struggling to survive before the coronavirus hit, which has in turn, contributed to the collapse of the global garment trade and wreaked havoc for millions of workers, the vast majority being women like Ms Orozco and Ms Litali.

Over the past two decades Lesotho’s garment industry, where nine out of 10 workers are women, has boomed to become its largest employer, crafting clothes for Levis Strauss, Wrangler and Walmart.

While Lesotho is a lesser-known garment powerhouse compared to China or Bangladesh, it is another example of an economy heavily reliant on US demand. Outside of the African continent, America is the largest recipient of Lesotho’s exports – accounting for almost half –according to the most recently available World Trade Organisation data from 2017.In the US, meanwhile, clothing retailers have been hit particularly hard. The country is one of the world’s top importers of clothing, accounting for nearly a quarter of global retail spend.

While J.C. Penney hasn’t been profitable since 2010, the 118-year-old chain filed for bankruptcy in May last year. Six months later, it was bought out but its workforce was slashed by more than 10,000 during restructuring, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to The Fuller Project.

US retailers

J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers also filed for bankruptcy this year. “And when a big US retailer takes a tumble,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, “the effects are felt across the globe.”

Last March, as US retailers cancelled or failed to pay for existing orders worth billions of dollars, the effects quickly rippled down the supply chain. At Tzicc Clothing, roughly one fifth of employees have lost their jobs since May last year, says Tšepang Makakole of Lesotho’s National Clothing and Textile Workers Union. ""For women, it’s a disaster...The industry is facing a total collapse.”

Ms Litali felt weak in the knees when she heard that she was suddenly unemployed. A widow for the last eight years, the seamstress single-handedly supports her youngest daughter, who is 20, and her four-year-old grandchild.

During the lock-down, her employer delayed her final $94 (Sh10,000) pay check for three months until May. The Human Resources manager at Tzicc Clothing, Masefatsa Mofolo, confirmed the company laid off staff due to limited orders. For months, Ms Litali received no income or support, instead surviving off donated food from the local church until her final salary arrived.

J.C. Penney

“I got so stressed; I thought I was going mad,” she says. “I would spend the whole day sleeping.”

Back in California, Ms Orozco occasionally walks past the town’s J.C. Penney. The windows are free from sale signs, the gates locked.

“I was close to the cleaning lady who worked there,” she says. “It broke my heart to know I probably won’t ever see her again.” A spokesperson for J.C. Penney declined to comment on the closures.

Although Ms Orozco lives with her parents, she still has car and phone bills. When her store closed temporarily in mid-March in adherence with Covid-19 measures, she was out of work for three months and applied for unemployment.

She used the time to finesse her side-hustle: a make-up business, selling lashes, lip glosses and clothes via Instagram.

She earns roughly $200-300 (Sh21,000-33,000) per month in sales, nearly five times less than her salary at J.C. Penney.

Today, both Ms Litali and Ms Orozco’s lives look uncertain. In August, Litali landed a job sewing jeans at another factory, but she fears her temporary contract won’t be renewed. By next year, Orozco hopes to have saved enough to open a brick-and-mortar store. “It’s stressful but… I know one day it will be worth it.”

Women must shun the conduct of stereotyping female politicians,"Charity Ngilu, the second governor of Kitui County and one of the two elected women county bosses, thrust herself into Kenya’s presidential race after being in politics for barely five years, as an MP, and after only one parliamentary term.

The then Kitui Central MP, alongside the late Prof Wangari Maathai, made history with the – no doubt courageous and daring move – to become the first women in the country to contest the presidency – for years an exclusive boys’ club.

This was in the 1997 General Election that saw Ms Ngilu emerge an impressive fifth, to beat among others, veteran politician Martin Shikuku of Ford Asili, in the contest predictably won by Kanu’s incumbent, the late Daniel Arap Moi.

Prof Maathai came 13th in the crowded race of 15 candidates. Although hers has since been a consistence rise in the political leadership, holding Cabinet positions in the successive administration of Presidents Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta (after 2013 elections) – and now governor, Ms Ngilu is yet to attempt the presidency again.

Likewise, Ms Martha Karua, the long serving MP for Gichugu, a former minister in the Kibaki administration and the Narc-Kenya party leader, made a go at the highest office, in the 2013 General Election. She was the only woman in the ring of eight candidates.

Elected female governor

In the 2017 elections, Ms Karua returned to her Kirinyaga home county, contested the governorship and lost to Ms Anne Waiguru – the other elected female governor – in a closely contested race. Ms Karua disputed the results and unsuccessfully challenged them up to the Supreme Court.

In November last year, however, she won a reprieve at the Arusha-based East African Court of Justice and was awarded Sh2.7 million in damages for violations of her rights to a fair hearing in the petition.

Nairobi’s Anne Kananu Mwenda, was sworn in as the deputy governor last month, to replace impeached Mike Mbuvi Sonko. He had nominated her as his deputy before he was pushed out of office through a no-confidence vote by the Nairobi County Assembly.

This is just but a brief summary of recent history that tells of the struggles as well as experiences and of course resilience, of some of the most outstanding Kenyan women in the country’s male-dominated field – as they seek to fight their way to the nation’s top political echelons and leadership.

Elective political office

Although more women are now moving to top management roles in other sectors, indications are clear that the journey to high – specifically elective political office, is still replete with thorns. This reluctance to level the political field to ensure fair competition of women and men is what makes many Kenyans of goodwill – especially women – be deeply sceptical that there will be gender parity in the country’s politics.

As Kenya’s women battle for political space and top positions in politics, however, it is important for them to celebrate and support those already,  or on their way up, after defying many odds to achieve that feat. That support – moral or otherwise – by fellow women, is critical in encouraging those who intend to join politics to do so, with the knowledge that a sister will be present to not only egg them on, but to also give a shoulder to cry on.

Similarly, most of those already in positions will without a doubt, do with the encouragement, support and even mentorship of fellow women, to keep moving on.

That is why women should keep away from the common conduct of stereotyping leaders of the female gender, especially those in politics. This, however, is not to say that women should not criticise their own when they stray as leaders. Asking that of women is undemocratic and amounts to suppressing their voices.

Gender parity

It is also undemocratic – and this is very common, when leaders – in explaining away the low number of elected women in Parliament and County Assembly, take to a blanket blame of women voters “who are the majority, and cannot elect their own’’! Women, like all other Kenyans, are entitled to vote for candidates of their choice, irrespective of the gender.

Instead, as Kenyans, we must support women leadership by electing those qualified to the position. In the meantime, history has taught us that when women are not elected and appointed to political office, political decisions made do not sufficiently serve the needs and inclinations of the female gender.

That is why women leaders and those who support the course of gender parity must learn to reject and keep voicing out against the notion that women are to be “given” positions. Women and men are equal in the eyes of Kenya’s Constitution.

"On a mission to keep girls in school, protect them from sex pests","While living at a border town often offers lucrative cross-border trade for many people, this is not the case for teenage girls in Busia County.  Snarl-up of long distance trucks is a common feature at the town that borders Uganda.

The situation worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic with truck drivers having to spend longer days at the border town due to pandemic related checks.

Confronted with poverty, teenage girls and women in the region engage in sex in exchange for money; money the young girls need so much to purchase vital things like sanitary pads.

Many have dropped out of school due to early pregnancies, early marriages, lack of guidance by a responsible adult and ill-health resulting from sexually transmitted diseases.

A young Teso woman, Ms Abukayo Murunga is, however, out to change this story. The 26-year-old has been in rural Teso for the last five years, doing everything possible to bring other women into safe paths.

Access to education

“I am familiar with the challenges girls and women here go through. Challenges that limit their access to education and opportunities for growth. For instance, girls miss school during their menstruation days because of their parents’ inability to provide them with menstrual hygiene management products,"" she says.

Ms Murunga adds: ""I have seen families languishing in abject poverty and as a result, send their girls to engage in sex (not as express as it may sound) with truck drivers, as a way of fending for themselves and families. I have visited schools where girls as young as ten years have been impregnated. It breaks my heart. It is here that l find my reason to create change in this community.""

With every rising sun, Ms Murunga is out to scale up her efforts towards addressing these challenges. Her initial activities reached the girls through the Amot Network, a foundation she started eight months ago. Now she reaches them through the Border Hub – a youth and community development organisation in Busia.

She provides information on sexual reproductive health and rights to enable girls (and women) make informed decisions about their sexuality and not fall victims of their own desperation.

""With other like-minded individuals and organisations in the region like (CCGD), we do structured mentorship programmes; tailored towards providing information around goal-setting, life skills such as negotiation skills, assertiveness which go a long way to enable the girls stand up for their rights,"" explains the Bachelor of Information Systems graduate.

Last June, she adopted the T-boxes (Talking Boxes) approach where girls freely drop their concerns in boxes at a local church.

""I adopted the use of T-boxes after realising that many girls were not speaking out yet they were going through a lot in their homes. Since then, the responses have been overwhelming,"" Ms Murunga says.

She plans to partner with guidance and counselling teachers in local schools to introduce T-boxes once studies steadily resume, following Covid-19 interruptions.

Ms Murunga and like-minded individuals at the Border Hub run a Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) programme where they boldly speak to youths about sex, a taboo topic in Teso.

Teso region

""I am keen on providing information that’s focused on growing and nurturing them. I spend most of my time interacting with girls and women; getting to know their challenges and, together, we develop sustainable solutions.""

Ms Murunga observes that ""they have so far reached out to at least 200 girls within Teso region. The girls then act as ambassadors in their communities, hence strengthening our reach.""

Her outreach has seen close to 50 girls who dropped out of school, due to early pregnancies enrol back in class.

Ms Murunga, who is passionate about advocacy, research and policy reforms on SRHR, is the 'Kenya ni Mimi' (a signature programme by the Ministry of Youth and ICT) ambassador for Busia County.

She is an Emerging Leaders Foundation (EFL) Fellow and the pioneer for Young African Leaders Initiative (Yali) Busia - Chapter. She characterises her success in women and girls' issues in Teso to the knowledge and leadership skills she gathers from EFL and YALI.

Resource mobilisation

Her background with EFL and YALI, she says, has put her on the map including sitting on the Busia County Youth Technical Working Group where she has been directly involved in highlighting gaps that hinder youth development.

Thanks to EFL and YALI, Ms Murunga is equipped with resource mobilisation skills that have helped her engage organisations to provide sanitary pads to needy girls, implement the Talking Boxes and hold regular talks with girls in schools and churches.

Ms Murunga recognises that female poverty and reproductive health is a problem everywhere, thus uses social media too, to move the ""powerful information"" far and wide.

""I primarily use social media platforms to amplify girls' and women’s issues,"" she tells The Voice.

The main challenge in Ms Murunga's mission, however, is lack of a stable source of funding and a society that considers the topic on sex a taboo, and a patriarchal mind-set that limits women in terms of land ownership, decision-making and leadership positions.

For the alumnus of Kisii University, women's issues are pressing challenges all over the world thus require urgent attention.

“I want to be at the very forefront influencing the formulation, implementation and strengthening of policies around reintegration of girls who get pregnant prematurely. I want to advocate for the implementation of zero price on sanitary towels so that girls can easily access them and stay in school,"" says Ms Murunga.

In the words of Mahatma Ghandi, Ms Murunga believes that she is shaking the world in a gentle way.

Too poor for menses; period!,"Anyone who menstruates requires proper access to menstrual materials, safe and hygienic facilities and the right to manage it without shame or stigma. Unfortunately, some women and adolescent girls live in period poverty.

Research shows that more than 800 million women menstruate daily and majority can’t manage their menses in a dignified and healthy way.

American Medical Women's Association defines period poverty as inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, including, but not limited to sanitary products, washing facilities and waste management.

Period poverty is an underlying issue that contributes to the persistent high numbers of teenage pregnancies.

Studies have also shown that absence of an environment supportive of the girls’ menstrual hygiene management (MHM) hinders them from attending school.

Of the 250 girls interviewed in a study – Menstrual Hygiene Management and School Absenteeism among Adolescents in Ghana: Results from a School-Based Cross-Sectional Study in a Rural Community by Shamsudeen Mohammed et al., 60.4 per cent said lack of a private place to manage periods at school kept them off.

A majority (82.2 per cent) missed school due to menstrual pain, found the study whose findings were published last year in the International Journal of Reproductive Medicine.

Another 70.3 per cent were deterred by the fear of staining and being teased, while 63.4 per cent stayed away due to non-availability of pads.

Another study Menstrual hygiene management in rural schools of Zambia; a descriptive study of knowledge, experiences and challenges faced by schoolgirls by Joyce Chinyama et al. attests to similar challenges.

Girls in six rural schools in Zambia were interviewed.

They said inadequate provision of sanitary materials, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools forced them to stay at home during menstruation.

Isolating themselves

“Boys said they could tell when girls were menstruating by their smell and behaviour, for instance, moving less and isolating themselves from their peers,” the researchers state in study published in 2019, in BMC Public Health.

“Girls complained of friction burns on their inner thighs during their long journey to school due to chaffing of wet non-absorbent material used to make menstrual cloth,” it further reads.

The findings are a reflection of Kenya’s situation. It refers to a previous study in Kenya that established that “Poor WASH facilities deter girls from using the facilities at school, with most girls opting to stay home until they finish menstruating.”

On average, girls begin puberty at 10 or 11 years depending on factors such as nutrition, guides Unesco in its 2014 document Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management.

In Kenya, Unesco estimates that some 2.6 million girls in school need support to obtain menstrual hygiene products. Further, approximately 300,000 of girls in arid and semi-arid regions would require both sanitary towels and underwear at an estimated cost of Sh2.6 billion.

In 2012/13 financial year, Sh300 million was set aside for the Ministry of Education to provide the sanitary towels. This amount was reduced to Sh30 million in 2013/14 financial year.

Until 2017, the ministry provided an estimated 568,925 underprivileged girls in public primary schools in 82 districts (now sub-counties) within marginalised and slum areas.

The coming into effect of Basic Education (Amendment) Act in June 2017 guaranteed all girls in puberty age enrolled in public primary and secondary schools, free provision of pads. In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was allocated Sh470 million. This catered for 14, 813, 810 packets distributed to 3.7 million girls during the fiscal year.  A sum of Sh420, 618,057 was spent.

Private schools

There are 9.2 million girls enrolled in primary schools and 4.3 million others in secondary schools, confirms data from 2019 Census.

Although data on girls in private schools is elusive, the current data could suggest that 72 per cent of the targeted girls have not benefited from the State sponsored programme.

In May last year, the Ministry of Health launched Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030) with one of the five targets being commitment to ensure WASH facilities are provided in all households, learning institutions, public places, healthcare facilities, workplaces and correctional facilities.

“Without (access to menstrual hygiene materials, latrines and places to change, safe water and sanitation, and good hygiene practices like hand washing with soap), the school environment is unhealthy, gender discriminatory and inadequate,” states Unesco in its aforementioned publication.

Ministry of Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha announced mid-January the purchase of Sh470 million worth sanitary towels for an unspecified number of girls in public schools across the country.

He said the distribution would begin in the third week of January with each of the benefiting girls receiving a one-off bundle lasting them nine months.

“Each girl will get a collection of (pads for) nine months at once,” he said at Kahundira Primary School in Kiambu County.

It’s, however, unlikely that the girls will receive pads covering the nine-months with the financial allocation.

With the Sh470 million, at least 3.7 million girls will get four packets of the pads out of the 4.2 million needy cases. This will last four months.

In 2019, the then Public Service and Gender Affairs Principal Secretary Ms Safina Kwekwe revealed challenges bedevilling the programme.

“When we started distributing the sanitary pads in the 2017/18 financial year, we gave them out to 3.7 million girls. We spent Sh460 million. We only gave four packs to girls in public primary, secondary and special schools. We had nothing for girls in vocational training and other institutions,” Ms Kwekwe is quoted in a local newspaper article dated September 14, 2019.

She added: “We have been having challenges because the money is not adequate. We need to have more so that girls can remain in school throughout but we have only been able to give them four months’ supply in the past.”

With the new law accompanied with the Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030), it meant, the government sat at the centre of meeting the menstrual hygiene management needs of girls in public facilities.

In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was moved to the Ministry of Public and Gender Affairs only for it to be moved back to the Education ministry, late 2019 following hiccups in tendering and distribution.

From Tana River to Busia, menses remain a taboo topic burying girls in shame

In May last year, we shared a story on the challenges women in Tana River County face during their menses.

Fortunately, period poverty is fast becoming a thing of the past after we covered the story on menstrual hygiene challenges where women dug holes to sit on for hours during their menses.

The story that shocked the world, saw donors from as far as Turkey, Britain and the US march into the county to triumph over the shame of the 21st Century, marking the genesis of a revolution that is fast reinstating comfort to lives of the women and girls in the region.

Menstrual hygiene ambassadors and menstrual cops moved into villages donating countless sanitary towels.

“In the past, we could not even talk about our private parts, sanitary pads were not a language we spoke. We only did what our mothers taught us,"" says Salima Waqo, a mother of three.

Ms Waqo is one of the women who taught her children the traditional way of menstrual hygiene since that is what she knew.

According to her, she learnt about sanitary towels in June after activists started making door to door visits to teach on menstrual hygiene.

""Even my children knew about sanitary towels, but they never shared with me, they were embarrassed to do so,"" she says.

Leila Nuru, an activist and a menstrual cop notes that most women from pastoral communities are not schooled on sanitary towels, and rely on traditional methods, where rags are used or holes are dug in the worst circumstances.

The activist notes that even shops in the remote areas never stock sanitary towels.

""Women in our community are very shy, if they have to buy sanitary towels from a shop, the attendant has to be a woman, or they will send a child,"" she says.

Ms Nuru has started training men from pastoralists’ communities on understanding menstrual hygiene and how to support their children and women through the process.

According to her, in the community where men are the providers, only knowledge is required to sustain the solutions currently being implemented.

However, poverty remains the community's biggest challenge. As a result, the women have appealed to the national government and relative organisations to equip them with re-usable sanitary towels.

They say that unlike the disposable ones, re-usable towels are sustainable, cost, and environmental-friendly.

According to Muslima Godana, an activist, a lot of the disposable sanitary towels have ended up in water reservoirs and the streets, hence detrimental to both the environment and human health.

""The disposable towels need to be done away with as we adopt an alternative solution,"" she says.

Efforts to eradicate menstrual disparity in the county are encouraging, with the county government allocating Sh2 million to support menstrual hygiene.

Kenya Works Organisation among other organisations, distributes re-usable sanitary towels targeting 5,000 girls and women in pastoral communities for free.

In Busia County, many adolescent girls faced with challenges of accessing menstrual hygiene management products admit to having transactional sex for pads.

Ms Mary Makokha, the Director of Rural Education and Economic Enhancement Programme (Reep) says some parents only provide food for their families and ask the girls to look for other basic needs on their own.

“This is happening because of poverty – girls and some women don’t have the financial means to buy sanitary products,” says Ms Makokha, noting that men also take advantage of desperate students, sexually exploiting them before offering money for their basic needs.

The girls accept as low as Sh50 to buy sanitary towels.

“Girls are exposed to boda boda riders, truck drivers, shamba boys and even weird grown up men in the villages,” Ms Makokha adds.

The poverty rate pushes some of the girls to either engage in prostitution or marry young to ease the financial burden on their families.

Ms Florence Opetu* (not her real name), a Form Three student at Murende Mixed Secondary School says she engaged in the business when she could not afford pads.

“One day, I was having my periods but did not have pads; when I stood up, my clothes were stained. The whole class started laughing,” she says.

This really embarrassed her.

“One day while heading home from school, a boda boda rider offered me a lift. I resisted hesitantly but after he persuaded me and assured that it was a mere lift, I accepted,” she adds.

The school girl says she ended up getting into a relationship with the man in his mid-30s.

Period poverty is a widespread problem in the country – and those who cannot afford sanitary pads use old cloths, pieces of blankets and newspapers.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, girls who got free sanitary products at school were pushed to desperate measures and scores became pregnant as they looked for money for pads.

The government failed to extend the services to their homes when schools closed on March 15, 2020, leaving the girls at the mercy of the society.

Meanwhile in Kilifi County, stakeholders and organisations have been in the frontline to boost the National government’s initiative, through the Woman Representative’s office, to provide sanitary towels to school girls.

This is an indication that the sanitary pads being distributed by National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) do not meet the demands in schools.

The Filipino winning souls while ensuring they enjoy every moment of life

As you drive towards South Kinangop, off the Naivasha-Nairobi highway, there is an imposing house on the hill overlooking Lake Naivasha.

The house owner is a Filipino woman who came to Kenya in 1998. Ms Minalyn Nicklin, 56, is a missionary with a big vision and mission; to help poor girls and women in Naivasha and its environs enjoy safe menstrual hygiene management (MHM).

She makes reusable sanitary pads that are environmentally friendly, accessible and affordable, in a section of her house, which she has converted into a workshop.

Disposable sanitary pads are prohibitively expensive for girls and women in Naivasha rural villages. This means that during menstruation, they use old clothes which often leak, staining their dresses and are uncomfortable.

Ms Nicklin wants this to change. ""I believe every journey in a positive direction starts with a single step. Making sanitary pads that are easy to use, inexpensive, and recyclable could be a big help for women.""

Her husband, Mr Peter Nicklin who is a medical doctor and her step son Alistair support her venture.

She says limited access to clean water, proper sanitation facilities and sanitary pads make it difficult for girls and women to manage their menstruation hygienically.

As a result, many young women face considerable physical and social challenges during menstruation, including missing school and missing out on important economic activities.

Ms Nicklin’s venture has support from local partners and individual volunteers from the US.

Her pads are made of cotton with the inside layer made from a nylon-type fabric. They are washable after use enabling users to save money because of a longer utility.

Women and girls who use them say they are comfortable and leak-free.

""I have no fears moving and doing my house chores,"" says Ms Jemimah Musimbi, a beneficiary.

Ms Nicklin says the objective of her missionary work in the country is not just to win souls alone but also make sure the souls enjoy every moment of their lives.

“I have discovered that many poor women and girls in the surrounding villages use old rags, and other unhygienic substances like leaves as pad during menstruation,"" says the mother of two.

This, she says, could lead to reproductive diseases and affect maternal mortality.

""My mission is not just to increase the accessibility and use of clean sanitary pads, but also create job opportunities for rural women,"" she explains.

She has invested in five sewing machines and employed three workers.

‘Period man’ seeking to change men’s mindsets towards menses

He calls himself Period Man! A year ago, 28-year-old Mr James Atito was teaching girls at Kakuma village in Turkana County how to use pads, maintain cleanliness during the menses and manage pain among other things.

He had been contracted to undertake the sensitisation. Then one of the girls stood up and asked him: ""Why do you talk about periods? Are you period man?"" That passed as one of those curious queries. The session ended. Evening came.

As he took a walk around the village in the evening, he noticed a group of seven girls sitting along the paths on the rills. Some sat on the bare soil. Some on animal skins.

""I wondered why the girls were sitting there late in the evening when they should be at home,"" he starts off the conversation.

""I was shocked to be told that they were on periods and that they were forbidden from their homesteads until their periods were over. That was an unimaginable stigma. I felt so sad for them and it got me thinking. I said I must do something to end the stigma.""

His journey back to Mombasa, where he is based, was filled with thought of what he can do different to emancipate women and girls from period shame and discrimination.

After two months of researching through reading publications on periods and web scraping, Mr Atito found a missing voice in ending period poverty – that of men.

""Often men are barriers to women's access and use of family planning. And we tell men to be engaged in family planning but we don't tell them how. It's the case with how girls access and use sanitary towels,"" he says.

To reach men and use himself as an example of a male advocate in the fight towards ending period poverty, he settled for Period Man, an identity that equally identifies with the girl who sought to find out whether he has the monthly experiences of menses.

So who is the Period Man? This is the brand name behind Mr Atito that he copyrighted through formal registration with Kenya Copyright Board.

For the past one year, Mr Atito has run two campaigns on Facebook and Twitter,

#Men4Periods365 and #Men4PeriodsMovement, meant to raise men's consciousness on their role in ending period poverty.

He for instance shares information on period pain and its management, how to make reusable pads - a skill he learnt through apprentice - and maintain menstrual hygiene.

""Men perpetrate period shame and discrimination. My mission is to reach them at the household level and find sustainable solutions. Once we have solutions, we will no longer need to push the government or partners to provide girls with the pads,"" he reckons.

Mr Atito studied finance and accounting.

Period of shame that birthed Janet’s book My First Time

“It was a shocking, frustrating and sad. How is it that we are in 2013 and the girls are using chicken feathers and goats hides?” This is Ms Janet Mbugua’s reflection of a feature on period poverty titled “Period of Shame.”

Ms Janet Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, launched in 2014, to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls.

It was aired on a local TV station in 2013. It featured girls from Marigat in Baringo County who demonstrated how they fitted the non-absorbent goat hides or stuffed chicken feathers in their underwear. They pluck the feathers from a live or slaughtered chicken. While unmarried girls are allowed to borrow the goat hides from their married peers, a harmful practice that exposes them to infections.

One of the girls interviewed said: “It is very uncomfortable. It pricks you. During examination, I write while standing,” added the girl then in Class Seven.

At the time, 90 per cent of the allocation to the sanitary towels programme had been slashed.

Ms Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, born out of the pain and shock she felt when she watched the feature. Since its launch in 2014, Ms Mbugua has used it as the voice to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls.

‘Period of Shame’ was the topic of discussion in her subsequent talk shows. For days, the discussion trended on Twitter.

“People were outraged to the point they were leaving pads for those girls outside our gates of the TV station,” she shares. “And it triggered me, so I asked my boss ‘Can we do something? I don’t feel okay with this just dying as it is. She agreed and I came up with Inua Dada Initiative.”

The initiative, she says, was aimed at pushing the government to allocate the programme more money alongside mobilising resources to buy pads for the girls.

Later, they delivered pads and underwear to about 10,000 girls in Baringo County. Nevertheless, she was not happy about the one-off donation.

The need for a sustainable means to end girls’ inaccessibility to the menstrual products, proper sanitation facilities and information, nagged her. And this is how she ended up registering her foundation in 2014. And later in 2017, opting out of the media.

In 2018, she started compiling content for her book My First Time. The book that launched in February last year, profiles menstruation experiences of 50 girls including those with disability and HIV.

With the book, she purposes, breaking the silence on period poverty and ending the stigma, attached to it. She also features men’s voices.

“Men cannot be ignored in the conversation. They are our biggest allies,” she says.

Her book is bringing changes to how men perceive the subject.

“I’d go to places and fathers could come up to me and say ‘Your book helped me figure out, how to break down this conversation at home with my sons and daughters,” she says.

Ms Mbugua is extending the book to add an addendum on the Pan-African perspective on emerging period poverty issues during the Covid-19 period. The new version will be out in two months.

She says: “Period poverty was blown wide open during Covid-19. Suddenly, schools that were giving pads were closed. Suddenly, the women who were washing clothes to earn a keep had lost their jobs. A lot of girls turned to sex for pads, more than we know.”

She is happy her relentless efforts on social media have resulted in more people engaging in the subject, wrapped as a taboo.

“I posted a picture of my stained pyjamas…there were 10,000 likes and about 1,000 comments. It tells you people want to talk,” she says.

“A few people in the comment section are saying ‘Thank you for just opening this door for us to comment on an issue that is so often a taboo.’…and for me that is a win.”

In the midst of the pandemic, Ms Mbugua has maintained the momentum through virtual activities.

Last year, she held a virtual period party where women highlighted the prevailing challenges and advocated for action from the government. She has earned herself a special friend for her consistent campaign against period poverty; public criticism.

Late last year, her foundation embarked on a sustainable approach of ending period poverty. It entered into partnership with The Pad Project to run a two-pronged pad project in Nairobi County.

The all-female crew bringing prestige to the matatu industry,"Travelling by public means can be a nightmare to many passengers. In an industry perceived to be marred with chaos and uncivilised characters, one would only hope to safely arrive at their destination.

However, when you get to a bus station and are welcomed by smartly dressed ladies who diligently assist you with the ticket booking and even pray for you before you embark on the journey, you certainly want to be sure you are not at an airport.

This is the exact situation you meet at one of Nakuru town’s matatu termini – it is changing the status quo of the matatu industry.

Prestige Sacco, which has been in operation for years, has stormed the industry with its unique style of operation, a total shift from the norm.

With women as its main crew, the distasteful attributes of the sometimes rowdy, foul-mouthed and uncivilised touts is nothing in sight.

The ladies, dressed in red skirt suits complete with hats resembling those of flight attendants, are in full control of transport services, something that has seen the transport company feted for being the best in the country.

The female crew does all the touting, customer care and ferrying of passengers to different destinations across the country.

Ms Grace Njoki, who holds a diploma in information communication and technology is in charge of customer relations. Now in her fourth year working with the company, the 26-year-old’s job is to ensure customers leave the station satisfied, comfortable and motivated.

Once a passenger arrives at the booking office, Ms Njoki welcomes them with a gentle smile, warming their hearts before directing them to the booking office.

“I help potential customers with booking of tickets, direct them to their seats, tuck their luggage safely in the back compartment and ensure they belt up,” she says.

She then ensures each customer has received their cash balances, in case of any, before introducing the trip driver.  What follows is the invitation of a pastor to pray for the journey before the vehicle takes off.

When she was first offered the job, Ms Njoki says she was reluctant as she did not want to be associated with a job that has a negative perception from the minds of the public.

But upon learning their way of operation, she gladly accepted and has since been part of the crew.

“I realised that the customers appreciated our services so much and I started loving the job. I do not regret taking the offer,” says Ms Njoki.

The company named her the hostess of the year 2020. One of her main challenges is dealing with different types of customers, which she says can be overwhelming.

Ms Carol Nduko, on the other hand, is in charge of sales, marketing and customer relations department. A holder of higher diploma in sales and marketing, she says her job involves looking into the welfare of customers.

As a team leader, Ms Nduko handles complaints or compliments arising from the passengers using their vehicles.

“My work is to create a long-lasting relationship between the customer and the company by ensuring they get quality service. I even keep their contacts to follow up on them to know their journey experience,” she says.

Ms Ann Grace Wanjiku is a driver who criss-crosses the country ferrying passengers to different regions. The 27-year-old is a certified driver with more than five years’ experience.

In her fourth year working with the shuttle company, Ms Wanjiku says the experience has been thrilling, especially considering that she is among the few female drivers.

Negative attitude

She notes that doing a job that is dominated by men has not been all rosy as she has had to deal with negative attitude from some men who despise her.

""What keeps me going is my love for the job and the appreciation I get from the passengers at the end of the journey. Most of them congratulate me, including those who had issues at the start of the journey,” she says.

After operating for a decade, the company recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. For the second consecutive year, they were awarded for being the best fleet shuttle of the year.

They received a trophy last month in a colourful ceremony hosted by the road safety agency, Safety Plus Consulting Limited formerly the National Road Safety Agency.

Speaking during the celebration, Mr Alphayo Otuke, the Chief Executive Officer of Safety Plus Limited said the Prestige Shuttle has proved to be an important stakeholder in the government’s efforts to promote safety on the highways.

He said the agency considered many parameters ranging from the manner of operations, company innovations systems such as the Information Communication Technology that enable efficiency and accident ratings among other things, before settling on the winner.

“We need to see all stakeholders play their part in promoting road safety in order to reduce the worrying surge in number accidents along our roads,” said Mr Otuke.

While receiving the award, the company director Mr Steve Muli, who is also the chairman of the Central Rift Matatu Owners Association, said his aim is to change the traditional perception of the industry by offering decent services.

“We promise to maintain our quality standards to be emulated by other stakeholders in the industry. As we begin our second decade, our aim will be to see the matatu industry respected as any other serious business,” said Mr Muli.

The company has invested heavily on customer relations with their focus on the female employees.

Ms Chebet, a regular customer with the service says she has used the shuttles for four years now.

“I live in Baringo County but work in Nairobi, so I travel every weekend sometimes with my family, and I have been using the shuttles. I love the services because I do not need to worry about careless driving,” she says.

Mr Muli says he initially employed men before changing the strategy after four years of poor business. The director says the decision to have women in the crew turned out to be his golden opportunity as business blossomed very fast.

“We were shocked when the high number of customers overwhelmed our staff. We were forced to recruit more women after realising that the customers loved their services,” he says.

Bogonko Bosire: Chapter 4 - You're a source or a target,"

Jackal News, which Bogonko Bosire founded in 2011, became an alternative source of news away from local mainstream sites. Over time, it gained substantial following which bolstered Bogonko’s claim of owning the news and gossip too.

While running the blog, Bogonko’s drinking took a turn for the worse. In this episode we scrutinise Bogonko’s final year at Jackal News while tackling a subject that affects many journalists in Kenya- alcoholism. We interrogate if alcoholism could have contributed to a forced disappearance.

"Ending SGBV requires open talks about stereotypes, norms","Sexual violence is not a women’s problem, nor a girl’s problem. It is an entire society’s problem because it affects us all. Breaking down harmful stereotypes and bringing men and boys into the conversation are two of the most important norm changes we collectively need to nurture.

Sexual violence and harassment take place in our homes, public spaces, workplaces, on the streets and in our education institutions. Exposure is heightened in conflict and emergency contexts.

During Covid-19, violence in the home has become what the global community call, the ‘shadow pandemic’. Reports from Kenya’s national helpline that responds to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) has seen a huge spike in calls since the pandemic began.

Early and forced marriage

Women and girls in Kenya often experience alternate but equally damaging forms of SGBV, both mentally and physically, including child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation and femicide. One in three women globally are affected by gender-based violence, and in Kenya, statistics record 45 per cent of women and girls aged 15-49 have experienced SGBV. One in five women have suffered from female genital mutilation (FGM) in Kenya and 23 per cent of the nation’s girls are married before their 18th birthday, while four per cent are married before their 15th birthday.

The exact numbers of rape and sexual assaults are difficult to assert due to reluctance or fear for victims to report it, and inefficiency in addressing the reports adequately because of lack of capacity and resources and sometimes will.

We are daily witnesses to ‘rape culture’, sometimes even silent bystanders. Society has entrenched the use of misogynistic language, the objectification of women’s bodies on screens, indifference to consent, and the glamorisation of violence in advertisements.

Victim-blaming

Victim-blaming, trivialising of rape and the stigma faced by survivors are still far too common. The understanding of mutual consent; that only yes means yes, given freely without manipulation or coercion – is paramount in the prevention and eradication of rape and sexual harassment.

Male involvement in ending SGBV is particularly crucial as many Kenyan communities remain highly patriarchal. As authority figures, men hold more power and influence over decision-making in the social domain and are often considered the custodians of culture. They are in a position to determine the cultural traits, behaviours and social practices that are viewed as either good or harmful.

The socialisation of boys at an early age can have a long-term impact in shifting gender norms. Some harmful traditional notions of masculinity have been identified as the key drivers of aggression among the male gender.

These include expectations of what it is “to be a man,” where boys are expected to be physically strong, aggressive, showing little emotion in order to maintain the tough persona. What boys learn about expectations of femininity and the value of women and girls at home and in the community also shapes their attitudes towards SGBV.

Healthy masculinity

Efforts should aim at engaging men on the dangers of toxic masculinity and internalised gender bias that can be harmful to the well-being of women and girls. By teaching boys about healthy masculinity, as well as the links between gender inequality and violence against women, we can begin to promote positive behaviours and attitudes towards women’s rights, while eliminating harmful gender stereotypes.

The government has clear legislation and policies on preventing and responding to SGBV. The State Department for Gender is coordinating efforts from a multi-sectoral approach to advocate for this cause. President Uhuru Kenyatta has made firm commitments towards the eradication of GBV and harmful practices by 2030 and to eradicate the practice of FGM by 2022. This strong commitment and leadership is a source of inspiration for all actors, including cultural and religious leaders and calls for concerted efforts to stop the violation of human rights.

16 Days of Activism to End Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign calling for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls. During the 16 days, from November 25 until December 10, we call on people from all walks of life to question those harmful stereotypes and norms that perpetuate violence. No further generations must struggle to cope with a legacy of violation.

If you or someone you know has experience some form violence – call the toll-free line 1195 or Childline 116 to report your case and seek support. You are not alone.

Remember elderly women in campaign to end GBV,"Maria is an 84-year-old widow from Riruta Satellite, a low-income suburb in Nairobi. She is a mother of five children, two sons and three daughters. Her husband died three years ago, leaving her with the family property that included unoccupied land and some rentals.

Shortly afterwards, she shared the property among her children as part of their inheritance and retained a portion as a source of income. Her youngest son was, however, unhappy with the division of property and maintains that his sisters have no rights to the property.

He became hostile and violent towards his mother, intending to directly collect the rent from the rentals. He has now threatened to kill his mother and sisters to take over ownership of the property.

Violence and ageism

Unfortunately, Maria’s story is just one of many. Violence against older women is widespread, with perpetrators ranging from intimate partners, family members, caregivers, and community members.

As we draw to the end of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, an annual international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls, we must reflect on and galvanize action around the need to better protect older women like Maria from all forms of violence and ageism (the targeting of older persons on the basis of their age).

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that one in six older people- those above the age of 60 - globally, were subjected to abuse in 2019. This was spurred by factors including alcoholism and property ownership disputes, among other issues.

Emerging evidence indicates that the abuse has sharply increased in many countries as a direct result of the pandemic.

Covid-19

Consider the containment measures instituted by governments to flatten the Covid-19 curve; the need for social distancing that culminated in the partial cessation of movement and in some instances, full lockdowns, have left, and continue to leave older persons alone, separated from caring kin who would otherwise often check in on them and ensure their wellbeing.

This exposes them to rogue community members, relatives and caregivers who use the opportunity to exercise their control and abuse, particularly against older women.

A report by the Social Science Research Council indicates that Kenya is among the countries reporting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent average increase in sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) amid lockdowns. This harrowing statistic encompasses SGBV against older persons. What is worse is that victims rarely report the abuse for fear of victimisation. A vicious cycle is, therefore, established, fuelled by ageism and sustained by the inaction of the government and communities.

HelpAge International Africa continues to work with communities to support them to recognize and prevent SGBV against older women and help them access safety and response services. This includes access to counselling and legal advice for survivors. We also provide older people with the information they need to seek support in case of abuse.

Violence and abuse

Additionally, we continue to advocate for laws and policies to protect older women from violence, abuse, and neglect. One such law is the Protocol to the African Charter On Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa. This law provides for, among others, the right to property inheritance by older women; their protection from all forms of violence and abuse, including those emanating from harmful traditional practices; and the provision of care and support. Four years since the adoption of the Protocol, Kenya is yet to ratify it, leaving the rights of older persons in the balance.

Ending SGBV against older women will take a concerted effort. The government should ratify and implement the African Union Protocol on the Rights of Older Persons. Additionally, it must fully implement existing legislation that protects the rights of older women, including increasing budgetary allocation towards the protection and promotion of their rights.

Communities must also treat older women with care and respect. Ageing is not an event but a process that starts at birth. It is, therefore, imperative that we collaborate in putting an end to the mistreatment of older persons including SGBV against them.

Tharaka Nithi County devising law to help end FGM,"Tharaka Nithi County is coming up with a policy that will give it legal power to fight Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).The county is among the 22 FGM hot spots in the country.

Speaking to the media in Chuka earlier in the week, the County Gender Executive Ms Sheila Kiganka who is spearheading the exercise, said the target is to help slay the FGM dragon by 2022 in line with the President Uhuru Kenyatta’s declaration.

She said the policy, soon to be taken to the county assembly to be made law, will give the devolved government latitude to finance initiatives to fight the illegal ‘cut’ that is rampant in Igambang’ombe, Tharaka South and Tharaka North sub-counties.

“We have already formulated the policy with the help of other stakeholders like Plan International Kenya and Ripples International,” said Ms Kiganka.

She said without a law, it’s difficult for the devolved government to fight FGM because it lacks the legal framework and mandate.

Outdated culture

She added that the policy brings together various collaborators in the fight against the outdated culture including non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations, Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders and the government to form synergies.

With the law, the county government with the support of the police and the national government will be able to prosecute FGM perpetrators.

Tharaka Nithi Women Representative Ms Beatrice Nkatha said it’s unfortunate some people continue to practice the outdated culture despite efforts by government and non-government organisations to end it.

She noted that the practice is common during holidays, especially in December and urged government officers to remain vigilant in order to arrest and prosecute any perpetrator.

“It’s embarrassing that there are people still clinging onto the outdated FGM practice that has a lot of disadvantages to our girls,” said Ms Nkatha.

According to Tharaka Nithi County Commissioner Ms Beverly Opwora, cases of FGM and other forms of GBV are on the rise in the region during the Covid-19 pandemic period.

Speaking to journalists separately at her office in Chuka town, Ms Opwora said the culprits are not sparing even girls as young as 10 years.

"Covid-19 has fanned cases of GBV, report shows","Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country in mid-March this year, cases of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) have been on the increase.

Across the nation, cases of SGBV have increased tremendously with girls and women forming the majority of victims.

Outgoing Chief Justice David Maraga was the first to raise the red flag over the acute increase of sexual violence relate cases filed in courts across the country.

On April 2, Mr Maraga noted that since March 13, when the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Kenya, sexual offences cases constituted 35.8 per cent of cases recorded since then.

A report released by the Federation of Women Lawyers-Kenya (Fida-Kenya) in May, also lifted the lid on rampant sexual violence against women.

The report, released by Fida-Kenya chairperson Nancy Ikunu showed Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa counties leading in GBV in the country since the outbreak of the pandemic.

It also listed Kakamega, Kajiado, Kiambu, Kilifi,Uasin-Gishu, Taita-Taveta, Vihiga, Bungoma, Lamu Siaya, Kitui and Nakuru as having recorded the highest number of GBV cases.

“The nature of GBV cases reported are mostly intimate partner violence, defilement and rape especially in Nairobi and Kisumu. Widow eviction and physical violence by in-laws was found to be prevalent in western region,” the report indicated.

The survey carried out by Fida-Kenya between April 15 and May 3, showed that a total of 289 cases were recorded.

Another survey by Trends and Insights for Africa (TIFA) showed that women are the majority victims of domestic violence at 52 per cent.

"‘Policare’ centres, a beacon of hope for SGBV survivors","Most victims and survivors of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) often blame the police for conducting shoddy investigations impeding their quest for justice.

As a result, many perpetrators of sexual violence go scot-free after being acquitted by courts for lack of evidence.

For a long time, survivors of SGBV and gender activists have been pushing for a one-stop centre to enhance reporting, evidence collection and accountability in sexual related cases.

During a webinar titled Prosecution of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Kenya organised by International Commission of Jurist (ICJ Kenya) 53-year-old SGBV survivor Jacqueline Mutere said the one-stop centres is the only way to ensure proper reporting and collection of evidence in sexual violence related cases.

She also rooted for the establishment of special courts for sexual violence cases just like there are special Lands and Corruption courts to ensure victims get prompt justice.

The campaign by the sexual violence victims and gender activists recently bore fruit after the Kenya National Police Service launched ‘Policare’ which is a one-stop SGBV center model established to ensure survivors of sexual violence can access counselling, medical and legal services from one place.

Integrated approach

Currently, two Policare centres have been set up in Nairobi and Makueni counties with a plan to establish more across the country.

This integrated approach, launched in August to handle SGBV cases is expected to encourage victims to report.

Currently, victims have to visit different institutions in the pursuit of justice which means they have to retell their trauma stories several time.

With Policare, a report is filed in one place where it can be accessed by all relevant institutions.

The model unit by the National Police Service (NPS) is designed to host all professionals involved in delivering justice to offenders while preserving the dignity of the victims plus the evidence they produce is expected to replace gender desks present in all stations.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua noted that the Policare model will be more of a system than a single physical identity intended to meet the dual objectives of improving care and support for survivors and increasing prosecution of the perpetrators.

Toll-free service

Complete with a 24-hour toll-free service for victims, Policare will host victims' interview rooms for women and children, crime records room, a triage, forensic evidence storage room, trauma centres, a room for medical examination and P3 issuance and male and female holding cells.

Public Service and Gender Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia last week while speaking in relation to the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence termed the launch of the Policare as timely.

“I commend the National Police Service for this innovative approach to handling SGBV,” she said.

High Court Judge Teresia Matheka recently observed survivors have high expectations on the Judiciary to dispense justice therefore, convictions are secured as a result of good investigations and strong evidence which she said sometimes lack when it comes to such cases.

Chapter 2 - Bogonko Bosire: Twisted genius,"

Bogonko Bosire self proclaimed that he “owned the news and gossip”.  He was an exceptional writer, hired by French news agency AFP during his third year of college, and went on to establish a notorious blog. While his writing and intellect were exceptional, his social skills were...peculiar.

In this episode we delve deeper into his world. A man who defied societal norms by wearing whatever pleased him, like women’s skinny jeans, and dealing in taboo subjects.

He was a walking contradiction.

In case you missed it, listen to episode 1 of this podcast, where we ask people in his circle when it dawned on them that he had disappeared, here.

Navigating the dynamic landscape of CFD forex trading in Kenya,"The world of financial trading is evolving rapidly, with Contract for Difference (CFD) forex trading gaining substantial traction across various markets. Kenya, a prominent economic hub in East Africa, is witnessing a burgeoning interest in CFD forex trading. This growth is not only reshaping the financial landscape but also empowering a new generation of traders to harness global market opportunities.

CFD forex trading allows investors to speculate on the price movements of currency pairs without owning the underlying asset. This innovative financial instrument offers several advantages, including leverage, the ability to go long or short, and access to a diverse range of global markets. These features have made CFD forex trading particularly appealing in Kenya, where financial literacy and technological adoption are on the rise.

One of the driving forces behind the growth of CFD forex trading in Kenya is the increasing accessibility of trading platforms. Digital transformation has enabled traders to access real-time market data, execute trades, and manage their portfolios seamlessly through mobile devices and computers. This ease of access has democratised trading, allowing individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds to participate in the forex market.

Kenya's youthful population, with a median age of around 20 years, is also contributing to the surge in CFD forex trading. Young, tech-savvy Kenyans are increasingly seeking alternative income streams and investment opportunities. Forex trading, with its potential for high returns and flexibility, is becoming an attractive option for this demographic. Additionally, the proliferation of online educational resources and trading communities has empowered aspiring traders with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the forex market.

The regulatory environment in Kenya is another crucial factor influencing the growth of CFD forex trading. The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) of Kenya has been proactive in establishing a regulatory framework that promotes transparency, investor protection, and market integrity. By licensing and supervising forex brokers, the CMA ensures that traders operate in a secure and fair environment. This regulatory oversight has instilled confidence among traders and investors, further fueling the market's expansion.

Exness, a fully licensed and leading global multi-asset broker, has recognised the potential of the Kenyan market and is actively contributing to its development. According to Ken van Damme, Exness Regional Manager in Sub-Saharan Africa, ""The CFD forex market in Kenya is growing at an unprecedented rate. We are seeing a significant increase in the number of traders and trading volumes, reflecting the market's immense potential. Our commitment is to provide Kenyan traders with the best tools, resources, and support to help them succeed in this dynamic market.""

Exness's efforts in Kenya highlight the importance of reliable and customer-centric brokerage services in fostering market growth. By offering advanced trading platforms, competitive spreads, and robust customer support, Exness is helping Kenyan traders to maximise their trading potential.

The economic impact of the growing CFD forex market in Kenya extends beyond individual traders. The market's expansion is creating employment opportunities, particularly in the fintech and brokerage sectors. As more brokers establish their presence in Kenya, there is a rising demand for skilled professionals in areas such as customer support, compliance, and market analysis. This trend is contributing to the country's economic diversification and resilience.

Moreover, the growth of CFD forex trading is fostering financial inclusion in Kenya. Traditionally, access to financial markets was limited to a small segment of the population. However, the accessibility and affordability of online trading platforms have democratised market participation. Individuals who were previously excluded from traditional investment avenues can now engage in forex trading, build wealth, and achieve financial independence.

The future of CFD forex trading in Kenya looks promising, with several factors poised to sustain its growth trajectory. Technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, are expected to enhance trading strategies and risk management. Additionally, the ongoing efforts of regulators to adapt to evolving market dynamics will play a critical role in maintaining investor confidence and market stability.

In conclusion, the CFD forex market in Kenya is experiencing remarkable growth, driven by technological innovation, a young and dynamic population, supportive regulatory frameworks, and the commitment of leading brokers like Exness. This vibrant market is not only transforming the financial landscape but also offering new opportunities for economic empowerment and financial inclusion. As the market continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping Kenya's economic future and positioning the country as a key player in the global forex trading arena.
