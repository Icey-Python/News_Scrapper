"Policeman storms forest station, kills two rangers and then ends his life","On Sunday night, Administration Police officer Evans Kimutai arrived at Cherangani Forest Station in Elgeyo Marakwet County where his girlfriend, a forest ranger, worked.

He had covered more than 300km from his work station at Todonyang Police Post in Turkana North sub-County in search of the said girlfriend.

It would later turn out that he was on a tragic mission.

Hours after his arrival, Cherangani Forest Station turned into a crime scene after the officer opened fire on Kenya Forest rangers, killing two and injuring one.

Then he turned the gun on himself to bring to an end his killing spree.

The young officer shot himself in the chin at the doorstep of the forest station manager.

When the gunshots finally went silent, three bullet-riddled bodies lay lifeless.

A third forest officer, Monica Kilonzi, sustained serious injuries on the upper right-side hand and right chest.

She was rushed to Kapcherop Health Centre before being transferred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret for medical attention. The three bodies were also taken to MTRH.

The assailant's girlfriend was not at the station at the time of the incident.

The forest officers who were killed have since been identified as Abdallah Dzabo Kitolle, 22, and Marion Jerono, 20.

Mr Kitolle, who was on duty as the night guard at the station, was killed as he attempted to alert three female officers.

He met his death at the doorstep where the two female officers were having dinner, after celebrating Madaraka Day at Kapsoar Sub County headquarters.

Mr Kitolle’s 21-year-old wife, Fatuma Omar, said her husband was barely worked for two years at the station.

“Abdalla was so caring and loving. He really loved me and our 10-month-old son,” said the young widow.

For the station manager, it was a lucky escape, as it appears the officer’s mission was to kill not just his girlfriend, but anyone in sight.

An AK-47 rifle was recovered at the scene of the crime. The assailant had three fully loaded magazines, of which he emptied one. Each magazine had 30 bullets.

The tragic Sunday night incident left Kapcherop Centre where the station is located in shock, as the forest officers and area residents struggled to come to terms with the tragic incident.

According to Elgeyo Marakwet County Police Commander Peter Mulinge, the heavily armed officer shot randomly, before killing the two KFS officers and injuring the third ranger.

Mr Mulinge said the assailant and his girlfriend had constantly differed. Their differences led the authorities to ban the assailant from the forest station.

According to the county police boss, the assailant's girlfriend was not at the forest station at the time of the incident.

According to officers at the station, the killer policeman claimed that some of his girlfriend's colleagues had been interfering in their relationship.

""We are still in shock following this incident. We call on young people to seek counseling from experts instead of taking matters into their own hands when facing relationship challenges,"" said area chief Andrew Chemaringo.

William Kimaiyo, an area resident, termed the incident as unfortunate, while calling on the government to ensure those recruited to join disciplined forces are young men and women of integrity.

""This incident has left us with a lot of pain as parents and residents, bearing in mind that the suspected killer was a well-known young man in this area. The government must be thorough in vetting youths joining disciplined forces to avoid such incidents,” said Mr Kimaiyo.

National Chief Conservator of Forests Alex Lemarkoko accompanied by senior KFS officers and a team of security officers from Kapsoar Sub County visited the station on Monday to assess the scene of crime and to condole with the families of the deceased officers.

“I had to fly from Nairobi to come and assess the situation upon learning that two of my officers had been killed by an assailant whom we have learned was a police officer from Turkana North. Unfortunately, we have lost two of our youngest officers,” said the KFS boss.

Mr Lemarkoko said police officers have embarked on investigations that will help KFS establish the root cause of the incident.

He, however, urged young people with relationship challenges to seek counselling instead of resorting to violence.

“As KFS we have a programme that we use to reach out to our officers. My advice to young people is that whenever they have relationship challenges they should always seek assistance from their seniors and other members of the society for guidance and counseling,” said Mr Lemarkoko.

US House passes Republican bill to sanction ICC over Israel,"The Republican-led US House of Representatives passed legislation that would impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court over its prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for Israeli officials related to the war in Gaza.

The vote was 247 to 155, with 42 Democrats joining Republicans in backing the measure.

There were no Republican ""nay"" votes, although two voted ""present.""

The measure is not expected to become law, but reflects continuing support for Israel in Congress amid international criticism over the Middle East country's campaign in the Gaza Strip.

Read: ICC prosecutor seeks warrants of arrest for Netanyahu, Hamas leaders

The White House last month criticized the ICC's decision to seek the warrants.

The bill is not expected to be brought up for a vote in the Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats.

The legislation, opens new tab would impose sanctions on people involved in ICC prosecutions of Americans or citizens of US allies that are not ICC members, including Israel.

It also would block such ICC officials' entry to the United States, revoke any U.S. visas and restrict them from US property transactions.

ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said last month - after more than seven months of war in Gaza - that he had reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Netanyahu's defense chief and three Hamas leaders ""bear criminal responsibility"" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October, vowing to destroy Hamas after militants attack southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

About 120 hostages remain in Gaza.

"Don't prosecute me, the law allows me to provide abortion services, medic argues in court","A clinical officer charged with the offence of providing abortion services has gone to court to challenge the legality of his arrest and prosecution.

Mr Gordon Akoyo is seeking a declaration that the arrest, detention and prosecution of him is illegal, arbitrary and in breach of the Constitution.

He also seeks a declaration that the arrest and prosecution of a trained health professional who provides abortion services is unlawful and in violation of the Constitution, the Health Act, the Sexual Offences Act and court precedents.

The petitioner stated that on September 5 last year, an unaccompanied minor, identified as ENM, arrived at a clinic with severe pain and heavy bleeding and asked for care, which he provided.

According to the petitioner, he received the minor at the age of 17 in his clinic, where she received emergency care, and upon examining her, came to the conclusion that the cause of the bleeding was severe menstrual bleeding and pain, or a miscarriage.

“While continuing to monitor ENM, electric power went out and the petitioner went to restore power. Upon the petitioner’s return to the examination room he found that she had left the facility without discharge,” the petition states.

Mr Akoyo says that on November 6 last year, he was summoned to Bamburi Police Station to record a statement regarding allegations of abortion.

The petitioner says that he was subsequently arrested and charged in Shanzu, where the court granted an application to detain him at Bamburi Police Station for five days for further investigation. Mr Akoyo says he was produced in court on November 15, charged and released on cash bail of Sh200,000.

He has challenged the charges against him, saying they are based on a mistaken belief by the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions that he provided abortion services and that abortion care is absolutely illegal in the country without regard to the Constitution.

In his petition to the High Court in Mombasa, Mr Akoyo has sued the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Inspector General of Police and the Senior Principal Magistrate of the Shanzu courts.

“The arrest and charge against the petitioner was made without any prior investigations into the alleged offence,” part of the petition states.

The petitioner claims that there was no inquiry on whether he was qualified and licensed to offer abortion care in line with the constitution, statutory and policy provisions and judicial precedents on abortion care in Kenya.

He adds that being arrested and detained for seven days on the alleged provision of abortion services, denied police cash bail and denying the opportunity to practice his trade and subsequent prosecution amounted to abuse and psychological torture.

“Arresting and charging the petitioner without regard to the constitution, statutes and prevailing judicial precedents on the law of abortion in the country creates a chilling effect not only for him but other reproductive healthcare providers across the country and limits their ability to fulfil their professional and constitutional obligations,” the petition states.

He argues that lack of clarity on the implementation of Article 26 (4) of the constitution has created fear and confusion among healthcare professionals, including himself, on the status of abortion in the country and violates the right to equality and freedom from discrimination.

The Article in question, under the Right to Life, states that ""Abortion is not permitted unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law.""

Mr Akoyo is also seeking an order quashing the charge sheet against him at the Shanzu Law Courts.

Furthermore, he wants a permanent injunction issued barring the DPP from prosecuting any health-trained professional providing abortion care as stipulated under Article 26 (4) of the constitution and the Health Act.

The High Court on Wednesday suspended the hearing of the case against Mr Akoyo at the Shanzu Law Courts pending the hearing and determination of his petition.

The case will be mentioned on July 29 for parties to highlight their submissions.

Man who was electrocuted at work sues Kenya Power Company,"On January 18, Nelson Wamboka Mangala went to work as usual, unaware of the imminent danger that would later change his life forever, leaving him disabled.

Mr Mangala has informed the High Court in Nairobi that he worked as a security guard and general cleaner at an apartment building in Ruaka.

Upon arriving at work that morning, he said he began cleaning the apartment buildings as usual. While cleaning one of the apartment units on the balcony he accidentally came into contact with low-hanging electric wires and was electrocuted.

He was rushed to Rua Family Hospital for emergency treatment.

However, his injuries were so severe that the medical staff at the hospital recommended his immediate transfer to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).

Low hanging electric cables

According to the court documents, at KNH Mr Mangala was diagnosed with severe burns on his face, right hand, left arm, forearm, and severe extensor injuries.

Consequently, he underwent and continues to undergo treatment at the hospital.

His treatment included escharectomy, fasciotomy, debridement, daily dressing changes, and surgery to amputate his right mid-forearm.

After the incident, Mr Mangala moved to court and sued Kenya Power Company to seek compensation for the injuries he sustained.

""The electrocution by the electric cables and the injuries the plaintiff sustained are a direct result of Kenya Power Company's negligent, reckless and liable conduct,"" he said through Mogaka Elkana Advocates.

Mr Mangala said that on the balcony of one of the apartments, the electric cables and wires were hanging very low.

Caused grievous injuries

""I was electrocuted while cleaning. I felt a strong electric surge passing through my body and immediately lost consciousness. I regained consciousness at the hospital, surrounded by my brother and doctors who appeared very concerned,"" he said.

Mr Mangala said that it was at that moment he realised he was in significant pain and had limited mobility due to the bandages covering his body.

""The hospital had to amputate my arm and start the rehabilitation process to address my injuries. I have been receiving treatment ever since the incident,"" he said.

The plaintiff has also highlighted Kenya Power's negligence as poor cable management and faulty wiring, which endangers the lives of people with faulty electrical cables.

Mr Mangala has also accused Kenya Power Company of failing to warn users about dangerous equipment and live electrical cables lying nearby.

The company, which is yet to file a response to the lawsuit, has also been accused of failure to repair live faulty cables that caused grievous injuries to the plaintiff.

Medical expenses

“Consequent to these injuries, the plaintiff is suffering immensely and has already incurred huge medical bills for corrective surgery and general treatment,” Mr Mangala's lawyers said in court.

According to documents filed in court, Mr Mangala has incurred Sh348,991 in medical expenses at KNH.

He also incurred medical expenses in other medical facilities before he was admitted at KHN for a total of Sh355,872.

“Despite issuing demands to Kenya Power Company, it has failed to make good the claim,” Mr Mangala told the court.

The plaintiff is seeking to be paid special damages amounting to Sh355,872, general damages for pain and suffering, loss of future earnings and future medical expenses.

“I pray for any other relief that this court may deem fit and just in the circumstances,” he said in the court documents.

Man who was electrocuted at work sues Kenya Power Company,"On January 18, Nelson Wamboka Mangala went to work as usual, unaware of the imminent danger that would later change his life forever, leaving him disabled.

Mr Mangala has informed the High Court in Nairobi that he worked as a security guard and general cleaner at an apartment building in Ruaka.

Upon arriving at work that morning, he said he began cleaning the apartment buildings as usual. While cleaning one of the apartment units on the balcony he accidentally came into contact with low-hanging electric wires and was electrocuted.

He was rushed to Rua Family Hospital for emergency treatment.

However, his injuries were so severe that the medical staff at the hospital recommended his immediate transfer to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).

Low hanging electric cables

According to the court documents, at KNH Mr Mangala was diagnosed with severe burns on his face, right hand, left arm, forearm, and severe extensor injuries.

Consequently, he underwent and continues to undergo treatment at the hospital.

His treatment included escharectomy, fasciotomy, debridement, daily dressing changes, and surgery to amputate his right mid-forearm.

After the incident, Mr Mangala moved to court and sued Kenya Power Company to seek compensation for the injuries he sustained.

""The electrocution by the electric cables and the injuries the plaintiff sustained are a direct result of Kenya Power Company's negligent, reckless and liable conduct,"" he said through Mogaka Elkana Advocates.

Mr Mangala said that on the balcony of one of the apartments, the electric cables and wires were hanging very low.

Caused grievous injuries

""I was electrocuted while cleaning. I felt a strong electric surge passing through my body and immediately lost consciousness. I regained consciousness at the hospital, surrounded by my brother and doctors who appeared very concerned,"" he said.

Mr Mangala said that it was at that moment he realised he was in significant pain and had limited mobility due to the bandages covering his body.

""The hospital had to amputate my arm and start the rehabilitation process to address my injuries. I have been receiving treatment ever since the incident,"" he said.

The plaintiff has also highlighted Kenya Power's negligence as poor cable management and faulty wiring, which endangers the lives of people with faulty electrical cables.

Mr Mangala has also accused Kenya Power Company of failing to warn users about dangerous equipment and live electrical cables lying nearby.

The company, which is yet to file a response to the lawsuit, has also been accused of failure to repair live faulty cables that caused grievous injuries to the plaintiff.

“Consequent to these injuries, the plaintiff is suffering immensely and has already incurred huge medical bills for corrective surgery and general treatment,” Mr Mangala's lawyers said in court.

"Don't prosecute me, the law allows me to provide abortion services, medic argues in court","A clinical officer charged with the offence of providing abortion services has gone to court to challenge the legality of his arrest and prosecution.

Mr Gordon Akoyo is seeking a declaration that the arrest, detention and prosecution of him is illegal, arbitrary and in breach of the Constitution.

He also seeks a declaration that the arrest and prosecution of a trained health professional who provides abortion services is unlawful and in violation of the Constitution, the Health Act, the Sexual Offences Act and court precedents.

The petitioner stated that on September 5 last year, an unaccompanied minor, identified as ENM, arrived at a clinic with severe pain and heavy bleeding and asked for care, which he provided.

According to the petitioner, he received the minor at the age of 17 in his clinic, where she received emergency care, and upon examining her, came to the conclusion that the cause of the bleeding was severe menstrual bleeding and pain, or a miscarriage.

“While continuing to monitor ENM, electric power went out and the petitioner went to restore power. Upon the petitioner’s return to the examination room he found that she had left the facility without discharge,” the petition states.

Mr Akoyo says that on November 6 last year, he was summoned to Bamburi Police Station to record a statement regarding allegations of abortion.

The petitioner says that he was subsequently arrested and charged in Shanzu, where the court granted an application to detain him at Bamburi Police Station for five days for further investigation. Mr Akoyo says he was produced in court on November 15, charged and released on cash bail of Sh200,000.

He has challenged the charges against him, saying they are based on a mistaken belief by the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions that he provided abortion services and that abortion care is absolutely illegal in the country without regard to the Constitution.

In his petition to the High Court in Mombasa, Mr Akoyo has sued the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Inspector General of Police and the Senior Principal Magistrate of the Shanzu courts.

“The arrest and charge against the petitioner was made without any prior investigations into the alleged offence,” part of the petition states.

The petitioner claims that there was no inquiry on whether he was qualified and licensed to offer abortion care in line with the constitution, statutory and policy provisions and judicial precedents on abortion care in Kenya.

He adds that being arrested and detained for seven days on the alleged provision of abortion services, denied police cash bail and denying the opportunity to practice his trade and subsequent prosecution amounted to abuse and psychological torture.

“Arresting and charging the petitioner without regard to the constitution, statutes and prevailing judicial precedents on the law of abortion in the country creates a chilling effect not only for him but other reproductive healthcare providers across the country and limits their ability to fulfil their professional and constitutional obligations,” the petition states.

He argues that lack of clarity on the implementation of Article 26 (4) of the constitution has created fear and confusion among healthcare professionals, including himself, on the status of abortion in the country and violates the right to equality and freedom from discrimination.

The Article in question, under the Right to Life, states that ""Abortion is not permitted unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law.""

Mr Akoyo is also seeking an order quashing the charge sheet against him at the Shanzu Law Courts.

Furthermore, he wants a permanent injunction issued barring the DPP from prosecuting any health-trained professional providing abortion care as stipulated under Article 26 (4) of the constitution and the Health Act.

The High Court on Wednesday suspended the hearing of the case against Mr Akoyo at the Shanzu Law Courts pending the hearing and determination of his petition.

The case will be mentioned on July 29 for parties to highlight their submissions.

‘Summit all seven continents’ highest mountains’: Cheruiyot Kirui's ultimate ambition,"Late mountaineer Joshua Cheruiyot Kirui, who died two weeks ago while attempting to scale Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, had dreams of becoming the first Kenyan to achieve the so-called Explorers Grand Slam.

His teammates from the Ultra Runners Kenya Club made the revelation during the funeral service held at Chepterit Primary School Grounds in Chepterit, Nandi County.

To achieve the Explorers Grand Slam or the Adventurers Grand Slam as it is also known, one has to summit all the seven highest mountains on each continent.

Bringing the body down is a risky and costly affair, depending on a number of factors, according to one of the late Kirui's close hiking friends, Limo Kipkemoi.

You would also have to reach the North and South Poles.

At the funeral service attended by family, neighbours, friends and colleagues of the late Cheruiyot, framed photographs of the late mountaineer on the summits of various mountains were placed along the tents where the mourners sat.

It was a fitting reminder to the people of Chepterit, who turned out in large numbers for the memorial service, that Cheruiyot was not only their son but also a son of the mountains.

On May 17, 2024, Kenyan hiker Cheruiyot Kirui posted this photo on his Instagram page before embarking on the Mt Everest climb.

Some of the teachers who taught Cheruiyot at Chepterit Primary School, where his funeral service was held, eulogised the late mountaineer as a humble student.Although they noted that Cheruiyot was a shy student, they attributed his quest to conquer the mountains to his hardworking nature and desire to excel in whatever he did.

His friend Peter Muhia and a teammate at Ultra Runners Kenya, speaking on behalf of hikers, said that climbing Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, as difficult as it was, was not the banker's ultimate goal.

Becoming the first Kenyan and one of the few Africans to complete the Explorers GrandSlam was his dream, Mr Muhia revealed.

Having already climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, Cheruiyot would have had five more mountains to climb after Everest before embarking on a journey to the opposite ends of the Earth's surface - the North and South Poles.

The North Pole is defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface.

""One day when we were climbing Mount Kenya with Cheruiyot, I asked him what would happen after we climbed Everest. He told me that after conquering the highest mountain in Asia, in January next year (2025), we would climb Mount Aconcagua in Argentina (the highest in South America) before planning to climb the other peaks,"" said Muhia, who was supposed to climb Everest with Cheruiyot before changing his mind.

The summits conquered on the way to the Explorer's GrandSlam include: Mount Everest (Asia), Mount Kilimanjaro (Africa), Denali - also known as Mount McKinley (North America), Aconcagua (South America), Vinson Massif (Antarctica), Mount Elbrus (Europe), Mount Kosciuszko (Australia) and Carstensz Pyramid (Indonesia), considered the only technical rock climb of the expedition.

Mountaineers paid tribute to Cheruiyot as a brave and dedicated athlete whose passion served as an inspiration to those around him.

Explaining to the mourners on behalf of the family the decision to leave Cheruiyot's body on Everest's summit, Muhia said the process of retrieving the body was too dangerous and would probably have cost other lives.

He added that Cheruiyot was an experienced mountaineer and a lover of the mountains and his death was an accident.

""We climbed Mount Manaslu (Nepal) with Cheruiyot in September last year and we set a record by becoming the first Africans ever to reach the summit of this mountain, which is over 8,000m high, without supplemental oxygen and a guide. I will say that Cheruiyot was a very experienced mountaineer and his love for the mountains was unparalleled. I know that in time, some of us will make it to the summit of Mount Everest and we will see Joshua's body,"" said Muhia.

Born in 1984 in Kapsabet, Nandi, to Ruth and Wilson Kenduiywo, he was the second child in a family of five.

His mother confirmed in an earlier interview that Cheruiyot had shown an adventurous spirit at an early age when he could climb tall trees in their compound to the top.

Overwhelmed with emotion, the mother had little to say at the service, except to pay tribute to her son as a ""special child"".

""When God gave you to me, I gave you back to him for his care and provision. I know he has received you and you belong to him. Amen,"" her tribute read.

His father eulogised him as a confident and determined person whose passion for mountaineering had made him an icon.

The late Cheruiyot's colleagues at Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) remembered him as a hardworking team player who inspired others to give their best.

Caroline Wanjeri, the Director of the Mortgage Division at KCB, who read the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Russo's message of condolence, described Cheruiyot as a 'Star performer in the bank' whose immense contribution to the growth of the business saw him bank the company's Prestigious Simba award at some point.

Cheruiyot joined the bank in 2009 as a management trainee at the KCB Nandi Hills branch before rising to become senior relationship manager, corporate mortgages at the time of his death.His professionalism saw him carefully balance his work with his passion for social and outdoor activities, achieving immense success in both. Before he was reported missing and his body was finally found on 22 May just metres from the summit of Mount Everest, Cheruiyot had climbed several mountains, including Mount Manaslu (8,163m), Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Ruwenzori, Mount Longonot and Mount Kenya more than 20 times.

He has also completed over 50 marathons and several ultra-marathons (over 50km).","By

I know that in time, some of us will make it to the summit of Mount Everest and we will see Joshua's body,"" said Muhia.

Born in 1984 in Kapsabet, Nandi, to Ruth and Wilson Kenduiywo, he was the second child in a family of five.

His mother confirmed in an earlier interview that Cheruiyot had shown an adventurous spirit at an early age when he could climb tall trees in their compound to the top.

Overwhelmed with emotion, the mother had little to say at the service, except to pay tribute to her son as a ""special child"".

""When God gave you to me, I gave you back to him for his care and provision. I know he has received you and you belong to him. Amen,"" her tribute read.

His father eulogised him as a confident and determined person whose passion for mountaineering had made him an icon.

The late Cheruiyot's colleagues at Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) remembered him as a hardworking team player who inspired others to give their best.

Caroline Wanjeri, the Director of the Mortgage Division at KCB, who read the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Russo's message of condolence, described Cheruiyot as a 'Star performer in the bank' whose immense contribution to the growth of the business saw him bank the company's Prestigious Simba award at some point.

Cheruiyot joined the bank in 2009 as a management trainee at the KCB Nandi Hills branch before rising to become senior relationship manager, corporate mortgages at the time of his death.His professionalism saw him carefully balance his work with his passion for social and outdoor activities, achieving immense success in both. Before he was reported missing and his body was finally found on 22 May just metres from the summit of Mount Everest, Cheruiyot had climbed several mountains, including Mount Manaslu (8,163m), Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Ruwenzori, Mount Longonot and Mount Kenya more than 20 times.

He has also completed over 50 marathons and several ultra-marathons (over 50km).","By

A glance at the disk jockey's deck reveals something that catches everyone's attention. A DJ wearing a doctor's dust coat replete with a stethoscope hanging on her neck.

Meet Dr Elizabeth Kuta, also known as, DJ Branula or DJ Dr Kuta. Dr Kuta is a neonatologist and a doctor for newborn babies. Those who have met her along the hospital corridors say she is extremely good with the babies.

For 15 years, Dr Kuta has been at it, ensuring that newborns receive the best care they can get to survive the dicey formative years of life.

But beyond the hospital corridors, Ms Kuta wears another hat - she is an entertainer!

Once she hangs up her stethoscope and the doctor's dust coat, Dr Kuta picks up her headphones to pursue her other passion.

For seven years, DJ Dr Kuta has juggled the two roles, which are worlds apart.

Just the same way syringes and needles dance between her fingers is the same way they skilfully move on the mixer. Her spinning technique, knowledge, and mastery of all music genres leave many people in awe. More so when they eventually learn that she is a staff at the Aga Khan Hospital child health section.

“Becoming a DJ had always been my dream career while growing up in Western Kenya. I, however, ended up becoming a medical doctor after doing well in my national exams,” says Dr Kuta.

Despite attending medical school, graduating as a medic, and securing a well-paying job, nothing could stop her from practising her dream career in music.

DJ Branula discloses that what she appreciates most about being a DJ is the music helps calm her nerves after a long week at work.

“Medicine happens to be my main career, but during weekends and my free time, I enjoy working as a DJ or spending time with my family,” says the medic, who adds that she is also a mother and a wife.

Dr Kuta attributes her passion for music to her father, who loved to play music over the weekend.

""However, I was not sure how to approach my parents or teachers with the idea. You know during that time, music was not considered a serious career,"" she says.

While still in primary school, one of her relatives planned a wedding. Dr Kuta and her two sisters were to present a song during the ceremony.

“I could tell that my sisters performed well by the response from the crowd. But when it got to my turn, I heard someone whisper that I was struggling with my vocals,” lamented Dr Kuta.

Even though she was still determined to pursue a career in music despite the poor presentation, the medic was certain that singing would not be part of that ambition.

But while selecting degree courses to pursue at the university, Dr Kuta chose civil engineering. However, her parents persuaded her to go for medicine.

“Had someone asked me at that time what I wanted to pursue, I'm telling you I could have chosen something related to music. Maybe I would have selected a course in DJ if we had such an option in the list,"" she says.

""What I remember however is that during those days, securing a chance to study medicine in a public university was a huge privilege.”

As fate would have it, she eventually joined Moi University, Eldoret, to study medicine. After six years, she moved to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, Kisumu, for an internship. That was in 2009.

Dr Kuta explains the desire to become a DJ was rekindled briefly while in Kisumu, but she could not find a school to enrol in.

When she returned to Moi University for a master's course in Pediatrics, a friend helped her to find a music school.

“I shared my dream of becoming an artist with her and despite not taking me seriously she still helped me to get into a school,” says Dr Kuta.

She enrolled at Mwafrika Sounds in Eldoret, immediately paid a third of the fees, and settled for the lessons. Although the training was to take three months, it dragged on for nine months since the medic had to balance classwork, hospital rounds and music training.

The medic says she would join her teacher during events and practice whatever she missed in class.

The doctor says by the time she graduated, she had also qualified to become a DJ.

“I find satisfaction working as a doctor, somedays, we lose, sometimes we win but the joy of treating a patient and seeing them respond to treatment can never be explained,” Dr Kuta beams.

She says that her dedication to medicine saw her win a fellowship to pursue a course in neonatology. She is the only practising neonatologist in Kisumu County.

Meanwhile, in any given free time, when not doing her research in the medical field, one is likely to find the doctor either performing at events, updating her music genre list or performing as a DJ to her close family members back in the house.

The paediatrician says working as a DJ and a health worker has helped her build a relationship that cuts across with clients.

On some occasions, she always meets some of her clients while performing with surprises written all over their faces.

“After meeting the clients out there during the gigs, interacting with them at the hospital is always quite interesting,” says Dr Kuta, who hopes to retire one day from the medical field and continue practising as a DJ.

Dr Kuta says that after hiding from her father her DJ life for years, she eventually gathered the courage to break the news to him by sending him a picture taken while she was performing.

""As expected he was appalled. He couldn't believe it at first until he saw me in action during a family event. He finally accepted and moved on, after all I am still practising the career he chose for me,"" she adds.

Last year, the medic had a chance to DJ for her family during her mother's graduating ceremony as a pastor.

""From their reactions, I could tell that they were happy with the performance,"" she says.

Dr Kuta, however, does not perform in nightclubs. This, she says, is because the crowd in clubs is always ""a little complicated.""

Even while performing at events over the weekends, the DJ says she always informs her colleagues to be on standby to hold in brief for her in case of emergencies.

“I also keep my phone close and advise the nurses on duty to call more than once in case I fail to pick. I am however glad that since I started practicing as a DJ, I have never had a situation that specifically requires my attention while performing in events,” says Dr Kuta.

"30 years of climate talks: Minimal progress, crucial stakes for Africa","In Bonn, Germany

As experts gather in Bonn for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a palpable sense of urgency and frustration.

Over the past thirty years, these international climate talks have aimed to tackle the worsening environmental crisis. However, many maintain that there has been little progress, prompting crucial questions about the importance and impact of these talks, particularly for Africa.

""Adaptation is a critical issue for Africa. That is why it is always on the agenda. But there is yet to be progress on National Adaptation Plans,"" Obed Koringo, a climate policy expert from Care International, says.

""I have been a climate negotiator for five years,"" Marlene Achoki from the Kenya delegation says. The progress has not been as fast as we expected, and that can get frustrating. But we have to keep going because we have been seeing some progress, especially on issues around adaptation.""

The Stakes for Africa

Despite being the lowest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, the African continent experiences the greatest impact of climate change. It faces rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall patterns, devastating droughts, and an increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events. These changes pose significant threats to food security, access to water, and the well-being of millions of people. The African Group has consistently emphasised Africa's vulnerability to these climate challenges, underscoring the critical importance of the outcomes of climate talks for African nations.

""Look at the flooding that happened recently in Kenya. More than 200 people died. That is the kind of climate disaster we are experiencing on the continent. Who is going to compensate us for that? That is why we must be here,"" says Anne Tek, a climate justice expert with FEMNET.

Why the Talks Matter

Platform for Advocacy:For African countries, climate negotiations are a vital platform to advocate for their distinct needs and perspectives. These discussions ensure that the voices of those most affected yet least responsible are heard on the global stage. This advocacy is crucial for pushing for policies and funding addressing the specific climate challenges African communities face.

Funding and Support:One critical aspect of the climate talks is the discussion of financial aid from developed countries to developing ones. This support is vital for Africa to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies. Although the promised $100 billion per year in climate finance from developed nations has fallen short, continued negotiations aim to hold these countries accountable and ensure that Africa receives the necessary funds.

Technology Transfer: Climate talks also facilitate discussions on technology transfer from developed to developing countries. Access to advanced technology can help African nations leapfrog to cleaner and more efficient energy systems, build climate-resilient infrastructure, and create sustainable agricultural practices.

Global Solidarity: These talks underscore the principle of worldwide solidarity and shared responsibility. They emphasise that the climate crisis is a collective problem requiring collective action. Africa's participation in these negotiations underscores its commitment to being part of the global solution despite its limited resources and contributions to the problem.

The road ahead

While the progress over the past 30 years may seem slow and insufficient, abandoning the climate talks is not an option for Africa. The stakes are too high, particularly for Africa.

""The United Nations Climate Change framework provides guidelines and rules under which all countries engage on climate change, in what is known as a multilateral process. These rules of engagement provide an equal playing field for everyone to come to the table and talk. This is the only place where people will listen,"" Julius Mbatia, a climate policy expert,

The Bonn talks are intended to prepare for the annual mega-conference on climate change, known as the Conference of Parties (COP), and typically involve highly technical discussions. In Bonn, the agenda for the COP is developed. As the newly elected chair of the African Group of Negotiators, Kenya is leading these talks and will also champion the continent's climate agenda at COP 29 later this year.

"30 years of climate talks: Minimal progress, crucial stakes for Africa","In Bonn, Germany

As experts gather in Bonn for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a palpable sense of urgency and frustration.

Over the past thirty years, these international climate talks have aimed to tackle the worsening environmental crisis. However, many maintain that there has been little progress, prompting crucial questions about the importance and impact of these talks, particularly for Africa.

""Adaptation is a critical issue for Africa. That is why it is always on the agenda. But there is yet to be progress on National Adaptation Plans,"" Obed Koringo, a climate policy expert from Care International, says.

""I have been a climate negotiator for five years,"" Marlene Achoki from the Kenya delegation says. The progress has not been as fast as we expected, and that can get frustrating. But we have to keep going because we have been seeing some progress, especially on issues around adaptation.""

The Stakes for Africa

Despite being the lowest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, the African continent experiences the greatest impact of climate change. It faces rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall patterns, devastating droughts, and an increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events. These changes pose significant threats to food security, access to water, and the well-being of millions of people. The African Group has consistently emphasised Africa's vulnerability to these climate challenges, underscoring the critical importance of the outcomes of climate talks for African nations.

""Look at the flooding that happened recently in Kenya. More than 200 people died. That is the kind of climate disaster we are experiencing on the continent. Who is going to compensate us for that? That is why we must be here,"" says Anne Tek, a climate justice expert with FEMNET.

The costly price of period poverty: Turkana schoolgirls skip classes,"Most girls in public schools in Turkana County who have attained puberty are missing classes because of unreliable and uncoordinated supply of sanitary towels.

The situation is worse for girls from poor backgrounds and in remote areas where they can't afford the pads when on their menses. Such girls opt to stay at home than feel ashamed.

In a spot check at public institutions, teachers confirmed that the national government has yet to provide free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels to every girl who should at least get nine packs of pads per academic year.

Read: Where are the free pads for schoolgirls?

The situation is forcing development partners of specific schools for donations with varied interests, with getting those committed to sustainably take up the task for many years being difficult.

In Kataboi Girls Secondary School and adjacent Kataboi Junior Secondary School in Turkana North with a total population of 700 students, for instance, school principal Omaido Robella always reach out to partners and well-wishers to support the girls every term.

Ms Robella says she understands family background of her girls and leaving them on their own to tackle menstrual hygiene is an uphill task that will not only expose them to sex predators and have a negative impact on their future if some of them decide to drop out of school.

“Not all students in the school can afford the sanitary kits because of poor background. Others don't even carry soaps to wash their panties. This is why I am always engaging partners to help.”

She recalled the most successful activity is when the school hosted well-wishers under Arsenal Turkana Chapter and more than six partners through a day’s event dubbed 'Pads for Love'.

On the outskirts of Lodwar town, the Church Mission Network targeted poor families in Natapar Kakono, Nakwamekwi and Kanam Kemer with relief food and free washable sanitary towels that can last for five years when well taken care of.

A parent, Jane Esinyen, said washable sanitary towels was a relief for her as despite being near Lodwar town, she can't afford pads for her two girls when the government delay to supply them as it is in the current situation.

“Without help, my girls have been missing classes for fear of staining their school uniform and being ridiculed. They see themselves as being dirty, unhygienic and impure,"" Ms Esinyen said.

Turkana Governor Jeremiah Lomorukai's wife Lillian Ekamais stressed the need for coordinated distribution of sanitary towels so that no girl is disadvantaged.

At Lodwar Mixed Primary school, with support from partners, she distributed 2,300 dignity kits, 2,600 packets of disposal pads and 550 reusable pads, and other items to support schoolgirls.

Ms Ekamais challenged partners to not only target schools within major towns but also reach out to border schools on Kibish and Turkana East as well as prioritise menstruation education as its negligence has led to infections among girls.

County Chief Officer for Preventive and Promotive Health Cathra Abdi regretted that stigma surrounding menstruation and a lack of sanitary pads had affected and forced girls to leave school.

She announced that her department would map out committed partners for strategic provision of sanitary towels across the county and raise awareness of menstrual health hygiene among adolescent girls.

Teachers, especially in secondary schools with high enrolment of girls, called on the government and development partners to install incinerators for hygienic disposal of used menstrual clothes and sanitary towels.

,"The whereabouts of thousands of Kenyan students who went abroad to study but later dropped out for various reasons is unknown, the Commission for University Education (CUE) has revealed.

The commission told a parliamentary committee yesterday that it could only give the number of students by gender who had gone to foreign universities, but not what exactly they were doing in those countries.

Following the revelation, lawmakers in the National Assembly expressed concern that the situation could lead to some students being deported or stranded in their host countries.

Appearing before the Committee on Diaspora Affairs and Migrant Workers, the Commission's Standards and Quality Assurance Division, Dr Eunice Marete, and the Commission's Senior Assistant Secretary (Standards, Recognition and Equivalence of Qualifications), Gilbert Opanga, told MPs that data protection in those countries prevented them from knowing exactly what the students were doing.

""We can give the number of students who have gone abroad by gender, we have the data and we are constantly updating it. We can also get the numbers that have gone from the agencies but we cannot get what they are doing because of data protection in those countries,"" Mr Opanga told MPs.

Mr Opanga told MPs that there was need to work with other stakeholders to know what students do after they drop out of their courses.

Read: Finland scandal: How Mandago’s aides moved millions of parents’ money to personal accounts

""We need to tighten the rules so that when they drop out, we know if they have enrolled for another course,"" Mr Opanga said.

He said they would compile data on the numbers by June and present it to the committee.

Mr Opanga told MPs that Australia and Ireland have become the favourites of most Kenyans seeking education in foreign universities.

Dr Marete said only licensed recruitment agencies are allowed to facilitate the enrolment of students in foreign universities.

Thousands of gullible parents and guardians have been duped of millions of shillings by dubious agencies that claim to be able to place them in some of the prestigious universities abroad.

Parents usually fork out millions of shillings to these fraudsters in the hope that their children will fulfil their academic dreams in the foreign universities. However, in most cases this has turned out to be a scam, leaving many parents defrauded but with no recourse as the agencies operate illegally.

When licensing recruitment agencies, the Commission requires them to submit the number of students recruited to each university and country. The data must be broken down by gender.

Agencies are also required to provide the name and level of the programme the students would be studying at the foreign institutions, the type of sponsorship, whether the students are self-sponsored or on scholarship.

If the students are on scholarships, the agencies are expected to provide the name of the organisation.

In order to be licensed by the commission, the agencies must meet other legal requirements set by the national government, such as having a certificate of incorporation, a business licence and a freight certificate.

However, Dr Marete complained that some agencies start operating as soon as they obtain these documents without a licence from the commission.

To curb this, Dr Marete said the commission is currently working with the National Intelligence Service (NIS), Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and county governments to ensure compliance by student recruitment agencies.

Dr Marete also lamented that with the advancement of internet connectivity, some agencies are opting to operate online, making it difficult for the commission to detect them and bring them under the applicable regulatory framework.

""The commission is keen to act on any negative information about agencies that comes from the mainstream media as well as social media,"" Dr Marete told the committee.

Cheers to the women who are ‘difficult to love’,"Warsan Shire's poignant poem ""For Women Who Are Difficult to Love"" lyrically celebrates feminine individuality and authenticity.

It’s an ode to that ""terrifying, strange, and beautiful woman who's a horse running alone, and he tries to tame you."" It honours the woman who's ""something not everyone knows how to love.""

If you are a woman who's ever tried to shrink yourself to fit into a man’s (or the world’s) idea of who you should be, then this poem is for you.

If, like the late Prof Wangari Maathai, you have ever been told you are too much of anything, then this poem is for you.

For those unfamiliar with Prof Maathai’s brand of “unlovability,” during her divorce, the Nobel laureate’s ex-husband claimed she was “too educated, too strong, too successful, too stubborn, and too hard to control”.

Read: It’s raining single women

Ms Shire’s poem symbolises women's unshackling from the demands and expectations of a deeply patriarchal society.

There's nothing more intimidating to patriarchy than a woman who is free, confident, outspoken, and self-assured.

A male acquaintance once told me that outspoken women needed to be domesticated — relegated to traditional roles of wife, mother, and homemaker.

I retorted that these women were not wild animals.

In retrospect, there's nothing wrong with being a wild animal in response to patriarchy.

Stella Nyanzi's brand of feminism is particularly wild and free. Ms Nyanzi is a Ugandan human rights advocate, poet, medical anthropologist, feminist, and queer rights advocate who has stripped to get her points across.

Defying patriarchy

Women staying in their stereotypical roles benefit the power structures of a patriarchal society. I celebrate all the women who defy this.

In an episode of the Women Lift Health Global Conference Podcast Series titled Confronting Fears That Silence Women, Speaking Up & Standing Out, two of the boldest media personalities I’ve ever encountered, Lizz Ntonjira and Rachel Ombaka, speak about the fear that holds women back.

It's a fear that, like the one described by Toni Morrison in Jazz about the character Alice, is “Seeded in childhood, watered every day since fear had sprouted through her veins all her life”.

Ms Ombaka and Ms Ntonjira discussed how girls are conditioned to seek approval, conform, and avoid criticism from childhood.

This fear of criticism follows them into boardrooms and sabotages them. They encouraged women to speak up, be bold, and unapologetic about who they are and their achievements.

As for me, I don't want to be a “good African woman”. I'm happy with being “something not everyone knows how to love.” I celebrate women from this tribe. Cheers to every woman who’s “difficult to love.”

From criminals to IT experts: Inside plan to reinvent Mulot,"The government has announced plans to establish an information and communication technology (ICT) hub in Mulot as part of efforts to shed the region’s reputation as East Africa’s cybercrime headquarters.

The devolved administration has secured land for the project to build Kenya’s first rural-based hub of its kind. The multibillion-shilling initiative will be implemented by the Kenyan government in collaboration with global ICT companies. This follows President William Ruto’s directive to the county government to secure land for the ICT hub.

“We want to ensure that the youths in Mulot put their talents to good use instead of engaging in cybercrime,” Dr Ruto said in Bomet town recently.

Illegal activities

For years, Mulot has been notorious for mobile money fraud, with trading centres such as Mulot Central, Mulot Olomirani, and Mulot Sunset becoming hotspots for illegal activities.

The Bomet County Government has secured 52 acres in Mulot Sunset for the ICT hub, said Stella Rotich, the chief officer in charge of ICT in the county.

“Setting up a software development factory will transform Mulot from a cybercrime hub to a centre of innovation and coding training for the youth. It will be a game-changer in the country,” Ms Rotich told the Nation.

She added that, in the interim, an ICT hub will be established on a 4.5-acre plot initially identified for the project, with tendering for the project expected to start in the 2024/2025 financial year.

Governor Hillary Barchok said his administration was working with the State to turn the region’s fortunes around.

“We have succeeded in securing the land and are looking forward to the allocation of funds for construction of the software factory,” Professor Barchok said.

The centre will also train the youth on e-commerce, said Bomet East MP Richard Yegon, adding:“It is important that we rid the area of crime. The software factory will expand Mulot into a major trading centre and create employment for locals.”

SIM swap criminals

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been tracking down SIM swap criminals.

County police boss Robinson Ndiwa told the Nation that the crackdown was starting to bear fruits following the arrest of several suspects.

“The problem we are faced with is the failure by the victims to come forward and prosecute the cases, forcing the courts to release them,” Mr Ndiwa said. In the past six months, more than 25 suspects have been arrested.

A Bomet court recently released five mobile money fraudsters who were arrested with exercise books filled with names of the targeted victims alongside their mobile phone numbers, SIM card pins, M-Pesa balances, Fuliza limits, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) account details and KCB M-Pesa loan limits.

The books had records of names and dates of births of the SIM card holders, their home origins among other crucial details.

Police had also recovered 14 unused SIM cards, nine Safaricom used SIM cards and 11 national identity cards suspected to have been stolen.

The case collapsed after Safaricom and Airtel refused to cooperate with the investigators, according to State prosecutor Clara Boyon, with the Resident Magistrate Mbethi Michuki allowing the prosecution to close the file.

Following the police operation, a majority of the fraudsters have now relocated to Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu, Kajiado, Baringo and Nairobi counties.

Impending raids

The police have in the past been accused of colluding with the criminals by tipping them off about impending raids, thereby facilitating their escape.

On May 17, 2024, a police officer was arrested in Kericho in a case where a doctor was conned of Sh1.5 million. Constable Richard Kipkoech Kirinyet who was based at Cheptalal Police Station in Konoin Sub-county in Bomet County was accused of receiving Sh489,788 through his mobile phone with the SIM card registered in his name, being part of the Sh1,521,633 fraudulently transferred to from the KCB account of a Nairobi-based doctor.

Interestingly, most Mulot cybercrime suspects are primary and secondary school dropouts.

They are suspected to work in cahoots with employees from mobile phone companies and banking institutions, some of whom have been sacked over integrity issues.

“We want to ensure that the youths in Mulot put their talents to good use instead of engaging in cybercrime,” Dr Ruto said in Bomet town recently.

Illegal activities

For years, Mulot has been notorious for mobile money fraud, with trading centres such as Mulot Central, Mulot Olomirani, and Mulot Sunset becoming hotspots for illegal activities.

The Bomet County Government has secured 52 acres in Mulot Sunset for the ICT hub, said Stella Rotich, the chief officer in charge of ICT in the county.

“Setting up a software development factory will transform Mulot from a cybercrime hub to a centre of innovation and coding training for the youth. It will be a game-changer in the country,” Ms Rotich told the Nation.

She added that, in the interim, an ICT hub will be established on a 4.5-acre plot initially identified for the project, with tendering for the project expected to start in the 2024/2025 financial year.

Governor Hillary Barchok said his administration was working with the State to turn the region’s fortunes around.

“We have succeeded in securing the land and are looking forward to the allocation of funds for construction of the software factory,” Professor Barchok said.

The centre will also train the youth on e-commerce, said Bomet East MP Richard Yegon, adding:“It is important that we rid the area of crime. The software factory will expand Mulot into a major trading centre and create employment for locals.”

SIM swap criminals

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been tracking down SIM swap criminals.

County police boss Robinson Ndiwa told the Nation that the crackdown was starting to bear fruits following the arrest of several suspects.

“The problem we are faced with is the failure by the victims to come forward and prosecute the cases, forcing the courts to release them,” Mr Ndiwa said. In the past six months, more than 25 suspects have been arrested.

A Bomet court recently released five mobile money fraudsters who were arrested with exercise books filled with names of the targeted victims alongside their mobile phone numbers, SIM card pins, M-Pesa balances, Fuliza limits, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) account details and KCB M-Pesa loan limits.

The books had records of names and dates of births of the SIM card holders, their home origins among other crucial details.

Police had also recovered 14 unused SIM cards, nine Safaricom used SIM cards and 11 national identity cards suspected to have been stolen.

The case collapsed after Safaricom and Airtel refused to cooperate with the investigators, according to State prosecutor Clara Boyon, with the Resident Magistrate Mbethi Michuki allowing the prosecution to close the file.

Following the police operation, a majority of the fraudsters have now relocated to Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu, Kajiado, Baringo and Nairobi counties.

Impending raids

The police have in the past been accused of colluding with the criminals by tipping them off about impending raids, thereby facilitating their escape.

On May 17, 2024, a police officer was arrested in Kericho in a case where a doctor was conned of Sh1.5 million. Constable Richard Kipkoech Kirinyet who was based at Cheptalal Police Station in Konoin Sub-county in Bomet County was accused of receiving Sh489,788 through his mobile phone with the SIM card registered in his name, being part of the Sh1,521,633 fraudulently transferred to from the KCB account of a Nairobi-based doctor.

Interestingly, most Mulot cybercrime suspects are primary and secondary school dropouts.

They are suspected to work in cahoots with employees from mobile phone companies and banking institutions, some of whom have been sacked over integrity issues.

Cheers to the women who are ‘difficult to love’,"Warsan Shire's poignant poem ""For Women Who Are Difficult to Love"" lyrically celebrates feminine individuality and authenticity.

It’s an ode to that ""terrifying, strange, and beautiful woman who's a horse running alone, and he tries to tame you."" It honours the woman who's ""something not everyone knows how to love.""

If you are a woman who's ever tried to shrink yourself to fit into a man’s (or the world’s) idea of who you should be, then this poem is for you.

If, like the late Prof Wangari Maathai, you have ever been told you are too much of anything, then this poem is for you.

For those unfamiliar with Prof Maathai’s brand of “unlovability,” during her divorce, the Nobel laureate’s ex-husband claimed she was “too educated, too strong, too successful, too stubborn, and too hard to control”.

Read: It’s raining single women

Ms Shire’s poem symbolises women's unshackling from the demands and expectations of a deeply patriarchal society.

There's nothing more intimidating to patriarchy than a woman who is free, confident, outspoken, and self-assured.

A male acquaintance once told me that outspoken women needed to be domesticated — relegated to traditional roles of wife, mother, and homemaker.

I retorted that these women were not wild animals.

In retrospect, there's nothing wrong with being a wild animal in response to patriarchy.

Stella Nyanzi's brand of feminism is particularly wild and free. Ms Nyanzi is a Ugandan human rights advocate, poet, medical anthropologist, feminist, and queer rights advocate who has stripped to get her points across.

Defying patriarchy

Women staying in their stereotypical roles benefit the power structures of a patriarchal society. I celebrate all the women who defy this.

In an episode of the Women Lift Health Global Conference Podcast Series titled Confronting Fears That Silence Women, Speaking Up & Standing Out, two of the boldest media personalities I’ve ever encountered, Lizz Ntonjira and Rachel Ombaka, speak about the fear that holds women back.

It's a fear that, like the one described by Toni Morrison in Jazz about the character Alice, is “Seeded in childhood, watered every day since fear had sprouted through her veins all her life”.

Ms Ombaka and Ms Ntonjira discussed how girls are conditioned to seek approval, conform, and avoid criticism from childhood.

This fear of criticism follows them into boardrooms and sabotages them. They encouraged women to speak up, be bold, and unapologetic about who they are and their achievements.

As for me, I don't want to be a “good African woman”. I'm happy with being “something not everyone knows how to love.” I celebrate women from this tribe. Cheers to every woman who’s “difficult to love.”

Mexico's election of a female president

This article would be incomplete without celebrating Mexico's first female president Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Having read about her background and litany of achievements, I daresay that this woman of many firsts was also “difficult to love”.

,"United Democratic Alliance (UDA) MPs who contested for constituency chairmanship won the seats, setting the ground for a major battle with governors at the county race.

MPs James Gakuya (Embakasi North), John Kiarie (Dagoretti North) and Johana Ngeno (Emurua Dikirr) won in their respective constituencies, according to UDA National Elections Board (NEB) chairman Anthony Mwaura.

The outcome of the Friday elections has set the tone for the county polls, with some of the sitting MPs now going for county chairperson slots and other highly contested positions declared by the party.

“All elected constituency delegates in phase one of the grassroots elections are notified that the National Elections Board (NEB) will soon issue notice of the date and venue of scheduled County Elections across the respective Counties,” said Mr Mwaura.

“In the meantime, disputes concerning the just concluded constituency elections will be dispensed with by the Electoral and Disputes Resolution Committee,” he said.

MP Gakuya is set to face off with Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja while Narok West MP Gabriel Tongoyo is preparing to run against Governor Patrick Ntutu for the county chairmanship.

Mr Ng’eno and his Narok East counterpart Ken Aramat have declared interest in becoming the county Secretary-General.

The race in Nairobi has since turned into a contest between Governor Sakaja and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. DP Gachagua is said to be backing Mr Gakuya.

Official results by the UDA NEB shows that Mr Kiarie and Mr Gakuya won chairmanship of Dagoretti South and Embakasi North, respectively.

Others who won the chairmanship are Fredrick Njogu Njoroge (Dagoretti North), Francis Mwai (Embakasi Central), Amutavy Benson (Embakasi East), Peter Dishon (Embakasi South), Diana Katile (Embakasi West), Paul Irungu (Kamukunji) and Antony Mburu Jasho (Kasarani).

John Makare (Kibra), Virginia Waitherero (Langata), Kenneth Macharia (Makadara), Florence Wambui (Mathare), Patrick Ngaruiya (Roysambu), Alice Njoki (Ruaraka) and James Kamau (Westlands) were also elected in their respective constituencies.

Mr Sakaja – who is banking on his political networks across the county has expressed confidence in carrying the day in the county elections. His side on Friday claimed victory in the constituency level election.

In the Friday elections, each of the 17 constituencies elected 20 officials. This means a total of 340 delegates. Mr Sakaja's side had claimed winning a total of 240 delegates out of the 340.

Last Wednesday, when Governor Sakaja held a delegates’ meeting at the Bomas of Kenya, he alleged that his opponent, Mr Gakuya, is a project of a senior party official.

“We shall not be divided by tribal politics, we shall pursue unity for a better Nairobi,” Mr Sakaja said.

But Mr Gakuya accused the governor of using goons to disrupt the peaceful election in Starehe Constituency, which were postponed by the party.

Nairobi South Member of County Assembly Waithera Chege, who is among the agents of Mr Gakuya, maintained that the MP will emerge the winner in the final vote.

“Governor Sakaja must accept that the chairman of Nairobi County is Mr Gakuya because numbers don’t lie,” Ms Chege said. She also alleged that some voters were being allowed to cast their ballots using identification cards that belonged to other people.

While addressing delegates at Bomas of Kenya, Mr Sakaja accused his opponents of advancing politics of ethnicity.

Mr Sakaja claimed that his opponent for the UDA Nairobi branch chairmanship position, Mr Gakuya, is a project.

,"United Democratic Alliance (UDA) MPs who contested for constituency chairmanship won the seats, setting the ground for a major battle with governors at the county race.

MPs James Gakuya (Embakasi North), John Kiarie (Dagoretti North) and Johana Ngeno (Emurua Dikirr) won in their respective constituencies, according to UDA National Elections Board (NEB) chairman Anthony Mwaura.

The outcome of the Friday elections has set the tone for the county polls, with some of the sitting MPs now going for county chairperson slots and other highly contested positions declared by the party.

“All elected constituency delegates in phase one of the grassroots elections are notified that the National Elections Board (NEB) will soon issue notice of the date and venue of scheduled County Elections across the respective Counties,” said Mr Mwaura.

“In the meantime, disputes concerning the just concluded constituency elections will be dispensed with by the Electoral and Disputes Resolution Committee,” he said.

MP Gakuya is set to face off with Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja while Narok West MP Gabriel Tongoyo is preparing to run against Governor Patrick Ntutu for the county chairmanship.

Mr Ng’eno and his Narok East counterpart Ken Aramat have declared interest in becoming the county Secretary-General.

The race in Nairobi has since turned into a contest between Governor Sakaja and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. DP Gachagua is said to be backing Mr Gakuya.

Official results by the UDA NEB shows that Mr Kiarie and Mr Gakuya won chairmanship of Dagoretti South and Embakasi North, respectively.

Others who won the chairmanship are Fredrick Njogu Njoroge (Dagoretti North), Francis Mwai (Embakasi Central), Amutavy Benson (Embakasi East), Peter Dishon (Embakasi South), Diana Katile (Embakasi West), Paul Irungu (Kamukunji) and Antony Mburu Jasho (Kasarani).

John Makare (Kibra), Virginia Waitherero (Langata), Kenneth Macharia (Makadara), Florence Wambui (Mathare), Patrick Ngaruiya (Roysambu), Alice Njoki (Ruaraka) and James Kamau (Westlands) were also elected in their respective constituencies.

Mr Sakaja – who is banking on his political networks across the county has expressed confidence in carrying the day in the county elections. His side on Friday claimed victory in the constituency level election.

In the Friday elections, each of the 17 constituencies elected 20 officials. This means a total of 340 delegates. Mr Sakaja's side had claimed winning a total of 240 delegates out of the 340.

Last Wednesday, when Governor Sakaja held a delegates’ meeting at the Bomas of Kenya, he alleged that his opponent, Mr Gakuya, is a project of a senior party official.

“We shall not be divided by tribal politics, we shall pursue unity for a better Nairobi,” Mr Sakaja said.

But Mr Gakuya accused the governor of using goons to disrupt the peaceful election in Starehe Constituency, which were postponed by the party.

,"Members of Parliament on Tuesday, June 4 made Higher Education and Research Principal Secretary Beatrice Inyangala commit to withdraw admission letters of students expected to join university until the exact amount the learners are to pay as fee is established.

More than 19,572 students did not take up their chances at university last year despite having been placed, in what lawmakers attribute to “inefficiency” of the new higher education financing model.

The opposition Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition has called for the scrapping of the funding system, saying it favours students from wealthy backgrounds.

National Assembly Committee on Education Chairman, Julius Melly, yesterday said his team has visited public universities and established that 10 to 15 per cent of students placed failed report.

Last year, some 130,485 students were placed to the institutions by the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (Kuccps). The number this year is 134,743.

“This committee went round and received complaints from universities, students and parents about the funding model,” Mr Melly said during a sitting with the PS, Kuccps Chief Executive Agnes Mercy Wahome, Universities Fund (UF) boss Geoffrey Monari and Higher Education Loans Board chief Charles Ringera.

“Some parents were shocked to see the fee structure and asked their children to choose something else.”

Mr Ringera said funding agencies are owed Sh29 billion for support to students in the current financial year that comes to an end in three weeks.

Under the model, a student applies for scholarship and loan after receiving an admission letter from the university she or he has been placed.

The 2023 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination candidates expected to join university in August and September got admission letters following the announcement of placement results last month.

The letters indicate the total cost of the programmes without indicating the amount students will get in form scholarships or loans. The annual tuition fee for degree courses ranges from Sh144,000 to Sh760,000.

Other expenses like accommodation and upkeep are not included.

The Daily Nation reported yesterday that learners are being forced by circumstances to choose courses they can afford rather than what they qualified for.

Some students who qualify for degree courses opt for diploma instead.

Mr Monari told the committee that 9,726 students lodged appeals against their categorisation last year.

Of these, 4,087 were moved to higher bands after providing new information.

There has been no follow-up on whether the unsuccessful 5,639 learners joined the courses they had been placed by Kuccps.

He added that more than 28,000 students did not seek funding from his agency.

Kabondo Kasipul MP, Eve Akinyi Obara, said university administrators told the committee during the visits that the Means Testing Instrument (MTI) used to categorise students is not effective.

“The MTI isn’t watertight. Get data from the universities on students who have dropped out and effect affirmative action immediately,” she said.

The MPs questioned the information used to classify students. The MTI uses information collected from the Kenya Revenue Authority, the National Hospital Insurance Fund, Kuccps, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, telcos, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, the National Employment Authority, Elimu Scholarship, the National Transport Safety Authority, the National Education Management Information System and the Integrated Population Registration Database.

However, the committee said many students deserving government support have been left out.

“The variables aren’t working. Your figures aren’t adding up and you are relying on wrong information. We don’t want to put our country on a lie,” Mr Melly said, sentiments echoed by Kibra MP Peter Orero.

Kuccps will open the system for inter-university and inter-programme transfers this morning.

Dr Wahome said a student placed at a private university but wishes to be at public institutions can apply for change at no cost.

She added that 18,558 students have been placed to private universities. This is double the 9,622 learners who were placed by Kuccps in 2023.

Kitutu Masaba MP, Clive Gisairo, suggested that the application for courses be linked to the application for funding so that fee structures only indicate household contributions.

The funding model categorises applicants into five bands.

Band One comprises students from households whose monthly income is below Sh5,995.

Those in Band Two come from families with monthly income of Sh5,995 to Sh23,670 while those from households earning Sh23,671 to Sh70,000 are in Band Three.

Band Four comprises students from households of Sh70,001 and Sh119,999 monthly income while those earning Sh120,000 are in Band Five.

In an interview with the Daily Nation in Mombasa, National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi said the government needs to ensure and promote equity and equality in funding university and college students.

“The policy on education has crumbled and doesn’t make sense. Unless you can put in place proper mechanisms to adequately fund education, you have failed as a government. The funding model has only succeeded in making things worse,” the Ugunja MP said.

“We have not seen positive results because the system was rushed. Students and their parents are finding it difficult to access money.”

He said opposition MPs are outnumbered in the National Assembly and could therefore not undo the model.

“We continue to voice these concerns and express ourselves robustly. We hope reason shall prevail and the government will see the sense to do what is right,” Mr Wandayi said.

"Anatomy of a sick nation: Patients suffer amid drug, vaccine shortage in hospitals","The country’s public hospitals are facing a severe shortage of essential drugs and vaccines, leaving critically ill patients without access to life-saving treatment.

Some of the most affected are HIV prophylaxis for children, painkillers, antibiotics, antidepressants, anticancers as well as antidiabetic drugs.

Also lacking are medicines needed in the performance of life-saving surgical procedures, such as anaesthesia.

The Nation has also learnt that the country has no syringes to administer vaccines.

The shortage exposes a deeper problem within the country’s healthcare system — inadequate financing, irregular and delayed release of funds for drug procurement and significant debts owed to international health organisations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).

This has led to empty shelves in hospital pharmacies and rising despair among patients who rely on these drugs for survival.

Read: Alarm as public hospitals run short of common drugs

It is not known when supply will be revamped, but Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha told the Nation that the shortage had been resolved, with some of the drugs already in the country and others expected next week.

Ms Nakhumicha explained that the challenges facing Kenya’s healthcare system are a reflection of the country’s health supply chain being broken and vendor-driven.

“A responsive supply chain is based on needs and once the needs are established, then data-driven quantification and forecasting is done to determine quantities for procurement. This is why I am focused on reforms. It’s not going to be easy to change, but I am determined,” she said.

Out of stock

Ms Nakhumicha also denied that nevirapine and zidovudine drugs were out of reach for many HIV-positive mothers with newborns.

“Those saying we are out of stock should check with the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (Nascop) on service and commodity security for HIV,” she stated.

“The country’s stocks of nevirapine cover 15 months while those of zidovudine cover 14 months,” the Health CS told the Nation, adding that global best practice expects them to have a minimum stock cover of at least nine months.

A spot check in hospitals and interviews with patients, however, indicated that there are no drugs in many public hospitals.

The Nation met 26-year-old *Joy Njeri, a newborn mum, outside Thika District Hospital in Gatundu South, Kiambu County, where she had camped from morning in search of paediatric HIV drugs.

It was her third day at the hospital.

Read: Mothers we lost inside maternity wards

Ms Njeri, who disclosed to the Nation that she was born with HIV, was at the hospital for drugs for her two-week-old baby.

“I am here because the doctors told me that they had run out of nevirapine and zidovudine, which are usually given as prophylaxis to a baby exposed to the deadly virus at birth so that they do not contract the disease through breast milk,” she said.

“I don’t want my baby to get HIV. I have been coming to the hospital with the hope that the vital medication will be made available. I was told to keep checking and that the hospital was inquiring from other hospitals if they had supplies.”

The same drug is missing in Kibra. Ms Zipporah Achieng’, a community health promoter and HIV warrior born with the virus, said she has been approached by parents who have run out of the drug.

HIV-positive

“They come to me because I am open about my HIV-positive status and have a three-year-old child who is HIV-negative. They want the same for their babies but unfortunately, the drugs that my baby was put on are out of reach for them.”

She disclosed that the situation is dire in Kibra with mothers who were lucky to get the sought-after drugs a few months ago sharing their doses with recent newborn mothers and putting their own babies in danger.

Ms Achieng’ is concerned that the country could be ‘silently breeding’ a new generation of HIV-positive children because the government has not made the drugs available.

The acting head of the newborn unit at Nairobi’s Pumwani Maternity Hospital, Dr Muthoni Ogola, said the hospital has been receiving lots of newborn mothers in search of the HIV prophylaxis.

As the hospitals report a shortage of critical drugs that are on the country’s essential list, a number are also recording shortages of children’s vaccines.

Many children being born now are going without the vaccines hence putting their lives at risk of contracting deadly diseases in future.

“There are also no doses of childhood vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). My baby has not received any jab. I am concerned about where I can get the vaccine. I have been to many health facilities in Kibra and Mathare,” Ms Lucy Atieno from Dagoretti revealed.

The shortage will see at least 1.6 million infants, a similar number of pregnant women as well as 750,000 girls under the age of 10 who need the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, fail to get them.

About 15,000 fewer children were vaccinated in April when the country started recording the shortages, but the number could be higher since the issue has not been resolved.

The HPV vaccine is given to girls under 10, who number about 750,000 every year. The remaining stock in some hospitals may not last a month.

A Ministry of Health insider told the Nation that the government has up to July 1 to clear a Sh1.5 billion debt for the last financial year to Unicef and Gavi so that Gavi can release their co-financing portion of Sh8 billion for this financial year.

Kenya, too, has to put Sh3.6 billion of its own into the scheme. This is because Kenya must submit its 20 per cent contribution to Gavi before the organisation releases its 80 per cent funding.

This is to put the country on a trajectory of self-sustainability and prepare it for the phasing out of Gavi backing.

“Last week, the government paid Sh1.25 billion to the international organisation and this opened the door for emergency procurement. The government has since requested Unicef to expedite delivery. We are expecting the first batch next week. But should the government fail to pay the Sh1.5 billion, then Gavi will withdraw its support, including equipment,” said the official.

According to documents seen by the Nation, Kenya has not procured the DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis) vaccine for 10 months, with public hospitals reporting shortages.

The BCG vaccine, given at birth to prevent tuberculosis, has not been procured for eight months.

Already, TB, polio, measles, rubella, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rotavirus, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), measles-rubella (MR), human papillomavirus (HPV), yellow fever vaccine and malaria vaccines are out of stock.

It is recommended that a country has at least eight months’ stock of every vaccine in its supply chain.

Kenya’s current stocks of these vaccines may be exhausted in two months. This year, the government reduced the budget for vaccines from Sh2.6 billion to Sh1.2 billion, leading to unpaid bills and a shortage of Gavi-supplied vaccines.

Last week, a spot check by Nation in public health facilities around the country established that over 27 counties had run out of stock and were in dire need of key drugs and medicines on Kenya’s Essential Medicines List.

In an exclusive interview in the same week, Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) CEO Dr Andrew Mulwa disclosed that the authority was operating from hand to mouth given that as of May 29, all 47 counties owed it a total of Sh3 billion.

Kemsa gets 90 per cent of its business from counties and supplies drugs and medical equipment, giving counties a 45-day credit period.



“We are stocked up to 70 per cent,” Dr Mulwa said.

Therapeutic foods

He said that ready-to-use therapeutic foods, TB, HIV, malaria, Covid-19, cancer, blood transfusion as well as family planning/reproductive products are the most affected.

Kemsa also procures medical supplies on behalf of the health and development partners, this is then followed up with a distribution list for delivery to various targeted populations across the country.

Council of Governors Health committee chair Muthomi Njuki, however, told Nation that the allegations that counties owe Kemsa a lot of money hence affecting the delivery of drugs is a fresh plot to return the health function to the national government through a calculated smear campaign painting the devolved units as inept.

“As it stands now, counties have not received their equitable share from the national government for three months, including June, yet, the IFMIS system reportedly slowed down from mid-June, this is why we as governors cannot pay Kemsa the Sh3billion we owe them,” the Tharaka Nithi governor said.

He accused the national government of denying counties their equitable share of about Sh100 billion, adding that had the national government stuck to the law and disbursed resources on the 15th of every month, no county would be having a debt at Kemsa.

“A debt is not bad. The agreement we have with Kemsa gives counties a repayment grace period. Counties would not hesitate to clear debts owed if they receive money from Treasury,” Mr Muthomi said.

“The national government should also prioritise settling the Sh2billion pledge to Kemsa,” he added

Floods aftermath: Informal women workers’ saving power diminished,"For 11 years, Mama Yusra (as she prefers to be identified), reported to her workplace every day from 6am.

Her place of work was a small temporary iron-sheet shed over an open trench in the Makina area of Kibera slums, Nairobi County. From here, she sold boiled eggs and French fries.

As a single-parent raising four children, she knew that saving was the only way she would successfully educate her children.

“I want my children to live a better life than mine. All I do, I do for them,” she says.

Read: Death and destruction as floods ravage the country

With that in mind, every week,she would put aside Sh300 from the profits earned from selling boiled eggs in a savings group of 50 women working in the informal economy.

These women do domestic work for pay, sell fast-food like Mama Yusra, trade in second-hand clothes or grocery. None of them has insurance to cover them in case of an emergency, Mama Yusra says.

She made more profits from the French fries. From the business, she saved another Sh500 every week in a merry-go-round of 10 women and every two months, she would receive her accumulated share to pay her children’s school fees.

“In the group where we save Sh 300 weekly, we get all our savings in December.  That is the time I do shopping for my children. I buy them uniforms, books, new clothes and shoes. They also feel happy to have new things. I want them to be happy that they cannot be tempted to seek happiness elsewhere,” she says.

She has three girls and one boy.

Then last April became a doom’s month for her and her household. The raging floods from the heavy rains washed away her shed. It also soaked up her household items, which need repair or replacement.

“If I use the little money I have to repair the shed, then my children will go hungry,” she says.

“I have been out of work since late April and that means I have lost many days of savings. If I remain out of work until December, then for sure, my children will be out of school and they will suffer, since I’ll have little savings in the annual savings group.”

For women in the informal economy who depend on their irregular daily income to save, disasters such as floods greatly hurt their income flow.

And without insurance to cover the losses and help them recover, their livelihoods are highly unstable and the probability of falling into extreme poverty is particularly certain.

Mama Yusra is not the only one at risk of sinking into absolute poverty. In Kenya, women account for  more than 50 per cent of the 22.3 million working population, and 15 million Kenyans work in the informal economy where Mama Yusra falls.

There are ways of helping them get back on their feet and build their resilience to future climatic shocks. “These floods are reminders of how important it is to offer women in the informal economy social protection,” argues Grace Ananda, Africa policy and advocacy manager at Habitat for Humanity.

Social protection is a set of interventions whose objective is to reduce social and economic risk and vulnerability, and to alleviate extreme poverty and deprivation, explains the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.

These can be in the form of social assistance, which is publicly provided conditional or unconditional cash or in-kind transfers, or public works programmes.

It can also be in the form of  social insurance done as contributory programmes that cover designated contingencies affecting the welfare or income of households.

Governments can also introduce labour market protection such as providing unemployment benefits, building skills and training workers.

For now, Mama Yusra’s focus is to rebuild her business.

“My desire is to move to a better place. Not sell over an open trench. What if it rains again? Will I keep on counting losses?” she wonders.

"Anatomy of a sick nation: Patients suffer amid drug, vaccine shortage in hospitals","The country’s public hospitals are facing a severe shortage of essential drugs and vaccines, leaving critically ill patients without access to life-saving treatment.

Some of the most affected are HIV prophylaxis for children, painkillers, antibiotics, antidepressants, anticancers as well as antidiabetic drugs.

Also lacking are medicines needed in the performance of life-saving surgical procedures, such as anaesthesia.

The Nation has also learnt that the country has no syringes to administer vaccines.

The shortage exposes a deeper problem within the country’s healthcare system — inadequate financing, irregular and delayed release of funds for drug procurement and significant debts owed to international health organisations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).

This has led to empty shelves in hospital pharmacies and rising despair among patients who rely on these drugs for survival.

It is not known when supply will be revamped, but Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha told the Nation that the shortage had been resolved, with some of the drugs already in the country and others expected next week.

Ms Nakhumicha explained that the challenges facing Kenya’s healthcare system are a reflection of the country’s health supply chain being broken and vendor-driven.

“A responsive supply chain is based on needs and once the needs are established, then data-driven quantification and forecasting is done to determine quantities for procurement. This is why I am focused on reforms. It’s not going to be easy to change, but I am determined,” she said.

Out of stock

Ms Nakhumicha also denied that nevirapine and zidovudine drugs were out of reach for many HIV-positive mothers with newborns.

“Those saying we are out of stock should check with the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (Nascop) on service and commodity security for HIV,” she stated.

“The country’s stocks of nevirapine cover 15 months while those of zidovudine cover 14 months,” the Health CS told the Nation, adding that global best practice expects them to have a minimum stock cover of at least nine months.

A spot check in hospitals and interviews with patients, however, indicated that there are no drugs in many public hospitals.

The Nation met 26-year-old *Joy Njeri, a newborn mum, outside Thika District Hospital in Gatundu South, Kiambu County, where she had camped from morning in search of paediatric HIV drugs.

It was her third day at the hospital.

Ms Njeri, who disclosed to the Nation that she was born with HIV, was at the hospital for drugs for her two-week-old baby.

“I am here because the doctors told me that they had run out of nevirapine and zidovudine, which are usually given as prophylaxis to a baby exposed to the deadly virus at birth so that they do not contract the disease through breast milk,” she said.

“I don’t want my baby to get HIV. I have been coming to the hospital with the hope that the vital medication will be made available. I was told to keep checking and that the hospital was inquiring from other hospitals if they had supplies.”

The same drug is missing in Kibra. Ms Zipporah Achieng’, a community health promoter and HIV warrior born with the virus, said she has been approached by parents who have run out of the drug.

HIV-positive

“They come to me because I am open about my HIV-positive status and have a three-year-old child who is HIV-negative. They want the same for their babies but unfortunately, the drugs that my baby was put on are out of reach for them.”

She disclosed that the situation is dire in Kibra with mothers who were lucky to get the sought-after drugs a few months ago sharing their doses with recent newborn mothers and putting their own babies in danger.

Ms Achieng’ is concerned that the country could be ‘silently breeding’ a new generation of HIV-positive children because the government has not made the drugs available.

The acting head of the newborn unit at Nairobi’s Pumwani Maternity Hospital, Dr Muthoni Ogola, said the hospital has been receiving lots of newborn mothers in search of the HIV prophylaxis.

As the hospitals report a shortage of critical drugs that are on the country’s essential list, a number are also recording shortages of children’s vaccines.

Many children being born now are going without the vaccines hence putting their lives at risk of contracting deadly diseases in future.

“There are also no doses of childhood vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). My baby has not received any jab. I am concerned about where I can get the vaccine. I have been to many health facilities in Kibra and Mathare,” Ms Lucy Atieno from Dagoretti revealed.

The shortage will see at least 1.6 million infants, a similar number of pregnant women as well as 750,000 girls under the age of 10 who need the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, fail to get them.

About 15,000 fewer children were vaccinated in April when the country started recording the shortages, but the number could be higher since the issue has not been resolved.

The HPV vaccine is given to girls under 10, who number about 750,000 every year. The remaining stock in some hospitals may not last a month.

A Ministry of Health insider told the Nation that the government has up to July 1 to clear a Sh1.5 billion debt for the last financial year to Unicef and Gavi so that Gavi can release their co-financing portion of Sh8 billion for this financial year.

Kenya, too, has to put Sh3.6 billion of its own into the scheme. This is because Kenya must submit its 20 per cent contribution to Gavi before the organisation releases its 80 per cent funding.

This is to put the country on a trajectory of self-sustainability and prepare it for the phasing out of Gavi backing.

“Last week, the government paid Sh1.25 billion to the international organisation and this opened the door for emergency procurement. The government has since requested Unicef to expedite delivery. We are expecting the first batch next week. But should the government fail to pay the Sh1.5 billion, then Gavi will withdraw its support, including equipment,” said the official.

According to documents seen by the Nation, Kenya has not procured the DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis) vaccine for 10 months, with public hospitals reporting shortages.

The BCG vaccine, given at birth to prevent tuberculosis, has not been procured for eight months.

Already, TB, polio, measles, rubella, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rotavirus, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), measles-rubella (MR), human papillomavirus (HPV), yellow fever vaccine and malaria vaccines are out of stock.

It is recommended that a country has at least eight months’ stock of every vaccine in its supply chain.

Kenya’s current stocks of these vaccines may be exhausted in two months. This year, the government reduced the budget for vaccines from Sh2.6 billion to Sh1.2 billion, leading to unpaid bills and a shortage of Gavi-supplied vaccines.

Last week, a spot check by Nation in public health facilities around the country established that over 27 counties had run out of stock and were in dire need of key drugs and medicines on Kenya’s Essential Medicines List.

In an exclusive interview in the same week, Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) CEO Dr Andrew Mulwa disclosed that the authority was operating from hand to mouth given that as of May 29, all 47 counties owed it a total of Sh3 billion.

Kemsa gets 90 per cent of its business from counties and supplies drugs and medical equipment, giving counties a 45-day credit period.



“We are stocked up to 70 per cent,” Dr Mulwa said.

Therapeutic foods

He said that ready-to-use therapeutic foods, TB, HIV, malaria, Covid-19, cancer, blood transfusion as well as family planning/reproductive products are the most affected.

Kemsa also procures medical supplies on behalf of the health and development partners, this is then followed up with a distribution list for delivery to various targeted populations across the country.

Council of Governors Health committee chair Muthomi Njuki, however, told Nation that the allegations that counties owe Kemsa a lot of money hence affecting the delivery of drugs is a fresh plot to return the health function to the national government through a calculated smear campaign painting the devolved units as inept.

“As it stands now, counties have not received their equitable share from the national government for three months, including June, yet, the IFMIS system reportedly slowed down from mid-June, this is why we as governors cannot pay Kemsa the Sh3billion we owe them,” the Tharaka Nithi governor said.

He accused the national government of denying counties their equitable share of about Sh100 billion, adding that had the national government stuck to the law and disbursed resources on the 15th of every month, no county would be having a debt at Kemsa.

“A debt is not bad. The agreement we have with Kemsa gives counties a repayment grace period. Counties would not hesitate to clear debts owed if they receive money from Treasury,” Mr Muthomi said.

“The national government should also prioritise settling the Sh2billion pledge to Kemsa,” he added

Floods aftermath: Informal women workers’ saving power diminished,"For 11 years, Mama Yusra (as she prefers to be identified), reported to her workplace every day from 6am.

Her place of work was a small temporary iron-sheet shed over an open trench in the Makina area of Kibera slums, Nairobi County. From here, she sold boiled eggs and French fries.

As a single-parent raising four children, she knew that saving was the only way she would successfully educate her children.

“I want my children to live a better life than mine. All I do, I do for them,” she says.

Read: Death and destruction as floods ravage the country

With that in mind, every week,she would put aside Sh300 from the profits earned from selling boiled eggs in a savings group of 50 women working in the informal economy.

These women do domestic work for pay, sell fast-food like Mama Yusra, trade in second-hand clothes or grocery. None of them has insurance to cover them in case of an emergency, Mama Yusra says.

She made more profits from the French fries. From the business, she saved another Sh500 every week in a merry-go-round of 10 women and every two months, she would receive her accumulated share to pay her children’s school fees.

“In the group where we save Sh 300 weekly, we get all our savings in December.  That is the time I do shopping for my children. I buy them uniforms, books, new clothes and shoes. They also feel happy to have new things. I want them to be happy that they cannot be tempted to seek happiness elsewhere,” she says.

She has three girls and one boy.

Then last April became a doom’s month for her and her household. The raging floods from the heavy rains washed away her shed. It also soaked up her household items, which need repair or replacement.

“If I use the little money I have to repair the shed, then my children will go hungry,” she says.

“I have been out of work since late April and that means I have lost many days of savings. If I remain out of work until December, then for sure, my children will be out of school and they will suffer, since I’ll have little savings in the annual savings group.”

For women in the informal economy who depend on their irregular daily income to save, disasters such as floods greatly hurt their income flow.

And without insurance to cover the losses and help them recover, their livelihoods are highly unstable and the probability of falling into extreme poverty is particularly certain.

Mama Yusra is not the only one at risk of sinking into absolute poverty. In Kenya, women account for  more than 50 per cent of the 22.3 million working population, and 15 million Kenyans work in the informal economy where Mama Yusra falls.

There are ways of helping them get back on their feet and build their resilience to future climatic shocks. “These floods are reminders of how important it is to offer women in the informal economy social protection,” argues Grace Ananda, Africa policy and advocacy manager at Habitat for Humanity.

Social protection is a set of interventions whose objective is to reduce social and economic risk and vulnerability, and to alleviate extreme poverty and deprivation, explains the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.

These can be in the form of social assistance, which is publicly provided conditional or unconditional cash or in-kind transfers, or public works programmes.

It can also be in the form of  social insurance done as contributory programmes that cover designated contingencies affecting the welfare or income of households.

Governments can also introduce labour market protection such as providing unemployment benefits, building skills and training workers.

For now, Mama Yusra’s focus is to rebuild her business.

“My desire is to move to a better place. Not sell over an open trench. What if it rains again? Will I keep on counting losses?” she wonders.

“I'm, however, hopeful of reopening my business. But I wish the government would be more responsive and give the women whose businesses were affected unconditional grants to recover their businesses.”

Thai rice imports: Kebs to scrutinise new deliveries,"The government has said it will assess all rice imports to ensure only grain that meets acceptable standards is allowed into the country.

However, the Kenya National Bureau of Standards (Kebs) has said there is no indication that bad rice has entered the country.

Further, Kebs said it will continue laboratory scrutiny of all impending imports.

“No import will be allowed into the country unless it complies with the requirements of relevant Kenyan standards,” Kebs said in a statement on Tuesday.

Kebs was reacting to reports that Thailand is preparing to export 10-year-old grain to Africa.

“We have therefore alerted our appointed inspection agent in Thailand (SGS) of the impending government rice auction and instructed them to be on the lookout and subject all rice destined to Kenya from Thailand to mandatory inspection and testing,” Kebs said.

Last month, African diplomats raised concerns with Bangkok after Thai authorities announced a planned auction of rice that had been stored for 10 years ostensibly to recoup storage costs.

According to local officials, Thailand plans to auction this week some 15,000 tons of rice and export it to Africa, targeting up to $7.4 million in revenues from sales.

The grain is a remnant of a failed rice pledging programme by then Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra who encouraged farmers to grow more grain and supply it to the government at a predetermined price.

The scheme failed after Thai rice became uncompetitive and authorities estimated to have lost up to $13 billion in a scandal that forced Yingluck to flee the country and change nationality.

The officials did not indicate which countries the grain was headed to. However, several African countries, including Kenya, consume some of its white rice.

Thai rice is also consumed in South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Mozambique, and Côte d'Ivoire.

According to the Thai Rice Exporters Association, Thailand sold some 4.6 million tonnes to Africa.

“We became concerned because we don’t know the quality of that rice, which has been in the stores for 10 years. We don’t know the health status of that rice. We have not seen it ourselves. So we started to have some fears that somebody wants to sell bad rice to us,” said Lindsay Kiptiness, Kenya’s Ambassador to Thailand and the Dean of the African Diplomatic Corps in Bangkok.

“Why not to other parts of the world? The world is made up of six continents. Why Africa? We have a duty to protect the health of our people. It is not bad to consume old rice if it has been kept well. Old rice is not bad, but there is a danger that it can have aflatoxins,” he said.

Kebs said the age of the rice is not an issue as long as it meets certain standards.

Usually, the regulator uses three kinds of standadisation for milled rice (KS EAS 128: 2023), (Rough/ paddy rice- Specification and Brown Rice- Specification (KS EAS 764 and KS EAS 765) which are enforced by both countries of origin and destination ports of entry inspectors.

These standards do not prescribe shelf life for rice but Kebs says exporters must indicate the crop year, packing date as well as best-before-date.

They must also indicate the level of aflatoxin or heavy metals presence to confirm the suitability of rice for human consumption since physico-chemical properties do not significantly change if the rice is properly stored.","By

Sakaja lifts suspension on approvals of building plans,"Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has lifted the order he issued during the recent heavy rains suspending all approvals of architectural plans in Nairobi.

As a result construction work and the approvals of building plans and excavations at construction sites will resume.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Office of the Governor said professionals and representatives of stakeholders in the city would now have a say in the approval of building plans.

“Arising from this, the Nairobi City County Government (NCCG), through the acting County Secretary’s office, has written to various stakeholders requesting them to forward names of professionals and representatives who will now form part of the task force. The task force shall convene on the 12th of June to commence the audit exercise across the city,” the statement reads in part.

Such groups have been asked to complete their work and submit a report to the Governor's Office for implementation within the next two months.

“The task force shall convene on the 12th of June to commence the audit exercise across the city. The task force has 60 days to complete its work and submit a report to the Governor’s office for implementation.”

Governor Sakaja has also lifted the suspension of permit requirements and the exemption of fee payments for flood-related repairs and renovations (walls and buildings).

In addition, the governor has reconstituted the Urban Technical Committee (UPTC), inviting new representation from stakeholders including architects, urban planners, environmentalists and engineering bodies.

The UPTC is the committee responsible for deliberating and recommending the granting of building permits.

Sakaja's new directive comes in the backdrop of a court case filed in the City Magistrate's Court by Mr Victor Odhiambo.

The petitioner argued that it was unconstitutional and a violation of the right to fair administrative action under Section 4(3) of the Fair Administrative Action Act for the governor to suspend construction work.

Mr Odhiambo had also said such orders should have been made by the County Executive Committee (CEC) member responsible for Urban Planning, Stephen Mwangi.

“The planning Authority with respect to county government planning functions means the County Executive Committee Member and not the Governor. Any communication on planning matters should therefore fall under the ambit of the said County Executive Committee Member,” Mr Odhiambo said in his petition.

Mr Odhiambo further faulted the governor for issuing the order without statutorily supported or backed by a gazette notice, and that there was no conduct of public participation by the County Government regarding the matter.

“Growth is a continuous exercise and it is unfair to scuttle it without a just cause. Compliance issues should be continuous and not based on the governor’s fiat,” the petitioner said.

The case will be heard and determined on June 6, 2024.

Governor Sakaja has also lifted the suspension of permit requirements and the exemption of fee payments for flood-related repairs and renovations (walls and buildings).

In addition, the governor has reconstituted the Urban Technical Committee (UPTC), inviting new representation from stakeholders including architects, urban planners, environmentalists and engineering bodies.

The UPTC is the committee responsible for deliberating and recommending the granting of building permits.

Sakaja's new directive comes in the backdrop of a court case filed in the City Magistrate's Court by Mr Victor Odhiambo.

The petitioner argued that it was unconstitutional and a violation of the right to fair administrative action under Section 4(3) of the Fair Administrative Action Act for the governor to suspend construction work.

Mr Odhiambo had also said such orders should have been made by the County Executive Committee (CEC) member responsible for Urban Planning, Stephen Mwangi.

“The planning Authority with respect to county government planning functions means the County Executive Committee Member and not the Governor. Any communication on planning matters should therefore fall under the ambit of the said County Executive Committee Member,” Mr Odhiambo said in his petition.

Mr Odhiambo further faulted the governor for issuing the order without statutorily supported or backed by a gazette notice, and that there was no conduct of public participation by the County Government regarding the matter.

“Growth is a continuous exercise and it is unfair to scuttle it without a just cause. Compliance issues should be continuous and not based on the governor’s fiat,” the petitioner said.

The case will be heard and determined on June 6, 2024.

Ugandan murder suspect who escaped from custody rearrested,"A Ugandan national who escaped from lawful custody has been re-arrested by police in Kirinyaga County.

The suspect, who is suspected of murder, was seized on Tuesday when police officers stormed his hideout at Kangai village in Mwea Constituency.

Acting on a tip-off from the public, the officers took the suspect by surprise, seized and whisked him off to Sagana Police Station where he is being held for questioning.

Confirming the arrest, Kirinyaga police commander Andrew Naibei said the suspect will be charged with escaping from lawful custody.

He thanked area residents for helping the police to flush out the suspect from his hiding place.

""The residents cooperated with our officers, making it easy for us to trace and re-arrest the suspect,"" he said.

On Friday last week, the suspect sneaked out of Kiamaciri Police Station where he was being held while awaiting to be charged with murder.

Following the escape, two police officers, who were on official duty, were arrested.

The two officers will be charged with aiding the suspect to escape from lawful custody.

Kirinyaga County Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss Jason Mworia said the suspect is now heavily guarded and would soon be arraigned.

Mr Mworia cautioned residents against employing strangers.

""Residents should hire farmhands they know for their safety. Some of the people seeking to be employed as casual labourers are notorious criminal,"" said Mr Mworia.

The suspect went into hiding in November last year after he allegedly murdered his employer, Rose Muthoni Kariuki, at Kombuini village in Mwea and escaped with her mobile phone.

The deceased was found inside her house with blood oozing from the mouth and nose. The deceased also bore bruises on the neck.

Neighbours and family members became suspicious when they failed to see the deceased and decided to check on her.

That is when the body of the deceased was discovered inside her house.

The farmhand, who is believed to have had a hand in the murder, was missing from the homestead of the deceased.

Residents said the deceased woman, who was 64 years old at the time of her death, had been living alone before she met her death.

""The deceased had employed the young man from Uganda to work in the farm as her children were away from home,"" one of the residents said.

They described her as a humble, God-fearing and friendly person who did not deserve such a painful death.

The suspect was later arrested but escaped while being taken back to court.

Detectives travelled to Uganda and flushed him from his hideout and re-arrested him.

When the suspect was arrested the residents and the family celebrated. But their joy was short-lived when the suspect walked out of the heavily guarded police station unnoticed.

Detectives explained how they tracked down the mobile phone number of the suspect and caught up with him at his hideout and brought him back to Kirinyaga where he allegedly committed murder.

The phone belonging to the slain employer was also recovered from the suspect.

Court revokes Nakuru widow's estate control rights for concealing husband's Will,"The High Court in Nakuru has revoked the grant of letters of administration issued to Bhavna Karia, the widow of the late Nakuru-based lawyer Sandeep Manilal Karia.

This was after the court was told the deceased left behind a Will.

Justice Hedwig Ong’udi revoked the earlier ruling, noting that Bhavna had concealed material facts and misled the court when she petitioned for the letters of administration in December 2021.

Justice Ong’udi stated that Bhavna chose to proceed with her application despite knowing about the will, which is currently the subject of a grant of probate application before the Supreme Court in Australia.

""There is no doubt that the administrator knew that the deceased had left a Will but decided not to bring the same to the attention of the court whether the same is valid or not. It was for the court to rule on its validity,"" ruled Justice Ong’udi.

The will was brought to the court’s attention by Sandeep's brothers, Nalin Manilal Karia and Sunil Manilal Karia, who objected to the grant to their sister-in-law.

Sandeep died on May 9, 2021, while receiving treatment in Gujarat State, India.

He left behind a widow but no children. Sandeep was an advocate of the High Court of Kenya and the founder of SM Karia and Company Advocates.

The disputed wealth is estimated at over Sh120 million and has become contentious between the brothers and the widow.

Bhavna petitioned for letters of administration, claiming to be the first in priority to do so in cases of intestacy and sought to inherit her husband’s entire estate as the sole beneficiary.

Bhavna's petition included cash in various bank accounts, three parcels of land in Nakuru and three high-end vehicles.

Bhavna stated that she had consulted her husband's lawyer, Henry Aminga, who informed her of the will but could not establish its location.

Read: Lucy Kabuu - Star athlete, broken marriage and fight over matrimonial property

After filing her petition, she received a letter from her brothers-in-law in Australia informing her of the will in their possession.

She received an authenticated copy of the will dated February 4, 2003, on November 10, 2021.

Despite this, the brothers filed a protest on June 14, 2022, accusing Bhavna of misleading the court to obtain the grant through fraud.

They claimed they had informed her about the will, but she proceeded with the case. They presented correspondence with Bhavna's lawyers and a copy of the original will to support their claim.

The will named Sandeep's brothers, Nalin and Sunil, as executors and his father, Manilal Visram, as an alternative executor.

Sandeep left gifts of Sh17 million (100,000 pounds) for his wife and Sh50 million (300,000 pounds) for his sister Darsha Sunil.



His brothers were bequeathed Sh108 million (650,000 pounds) held at Barclays Bank, now Absa.

The deceased left all his funds and monies in India to his wife and three parcels of land in Nakuru to be shared equally among his five nephews and nieces.

The brothers argued that the will is pending a grant of probate in the Supreme Court in Australia, filed in May 2022, and sought to have the grant issued to Bhavna revoked.

The court faulted Bhavna for not disclosing this information.

""In my opinion, the acts by the administrator and her own admission as stated above amounted to concealing of material facts which ought to have assisted the court in arriving at a just decision. This was an outright breach of Section 76 (b) of the Law of Succession Act and the same warrants a revocation of the Grant of Letters of Administration issued to her on December 20, 2021,"" ruled Justice Ong’udi.

,"Sitting between Kokwa and Samatian islands in Lake Baringo is a beautiful scenery to behold on an islet that remains a mystery to many.

Scattered trees punctuated with rocks of various sizes and shapes create a beautiful landscape that completes the breathtaking view of the ‘Devils' Island’ amidst the lake waters.

It is one of the eight major islands in Lake Baringo, the others being Kokwa, Samatian, Lekorosi, Rongena, Parmalok, Lesukut, and Longcharo.

Even so, save for the sounds of chirping birds and the rustle of wind from the lake’s strong waves, the island, initially called Lasakut, is desolate and silent.

'Devils' den'

According to locals, no one has ever lived there because it is believed to be inhabited by devils, hence its name.

Mr Gideon Lekombe from Kokwa Island claims his family owned the Devils' Island decades ago. In the past, he says fishermen used to go there to fish, but that there were noisy wild whirlwinds at the rocky island that hampered their venture. The men eventually stopped fishing there.

“The fishermen concluded that the strange sounds were made by devils who inhabited it, and named it the Devils' Island,” said Mr Lekombe.

He claims the 11.8-acre Island is owned by the Lekombe family from the minority Ilchamus community that lives at the shores of the lake, and some members at Kokwa Island who hold the title deed of the dreaded islet.

Lake Baringo Senior Warden Jackson Komen confirmed that the main reason people don’t live on the island is they believe that it’s inhabited by devils.

“I have been to the island severally and I think the topography is the major impediment for people residing there as it cannot accommodate more than three families. It has a sharp rocky cliff with little vegetation. The winds there are also very strong, especially when there are strong tides at the lake,” he told Nation.Africa.

Failed businesses

The warden said more than three foreign investors have tried to start businesses on the island but all flopped for unknown reasons.

“Recently, one of them tried to set up some structures and even went ahead and planted trees before she left without giving any reason. The rocks have also made the area to be infested by snakes,” added the warden.

He was seconded by Mr Lekombe who said: “There was a white investor who tried to set up a hotel on the Island in the early 1970s and erected tents with the help of his two workers. However, due to the winds and the superstitions that it is inhabited by devils, he left in a huff and sought an alternative island at the Lake.""

In 2012, Mr Lekombe said, another investor also approached the family intending to set up a hotel. He had planted trees to beautify the bare rocky isle in readiness to put up structures.

“The island is very rocky, with few trees that sometimes fall off due to the topography, and that is why the investor planted trees. He requested us for the title deed but left before starting the said business,” said Mr Lekombe.

Nation.Africa learned that another investor also tried his luck in 2021, erecting portable houses and constructing a toilet on the Island. But he too, like the two others, left without giving reasons.

“The Island has remained desolate and no one has ever inhabited it since time immemorial. We have designated it to serve as a grazing field for our family during the dry seasons until we get another investor,” Mr Lekombe said.

“People dread living there because of the belief that it is inhabited by devils. As a family, we did not settle there because it is far (two kilometres away) from Kokwa Island which has social amenities like schools and hospitals. One needs to own a boat for transport.""

Strong winds

“The winds on the island are very strong and the waves at the lake intense, and it is not so good for habitation. That is why we fear living there. The winds on the island are more intense than the other islands because it has little vegetation and trees. I do not concur with the locals that there are devils on the island, it is just a belief.""

Whenever there are strong waves, boat riders keep off the island because they cannot land there safely.

“The Island has not benefited us because we do not live there and no investor has successfully set up a base there. We still believe that we will get one, but all the same, it is an asset to us. Someday, something good will come out of it, despite the strange name,” said Mr Lekombe.

A tour guide, Bashir Mohamed, who is also the proprietor of the Baringo tours and boat excursions also claimed the Devils Island has not been inhabited since ancient days, due to the belief that anyone who set foot there would be haunted by devils.

“The Island is believed to be associated with the devil. Elders claim that during the night they could hear sounds of people talking and cows, and also saw fires on the island. They also claimed that during those days, some fishermen would go fishing in that area would disappear and their bodies could not be found,” said Mr Mohammed.

“Swimming and diving are prohibited in that place because of the strong winds. Though the claims of the presence of devils is still a mystery, the family that lays claim to the Island doesn’t live there, let alone the locals. Recently, a white investor started construction and left. Nobody knows why, maybe she met the devil herself.""

,"""I am remorseful for my actions, I have learned my lessons. I pray for a lenient sentence.""

Those were the words of Mary Nekesa Ambani through her lawyer, three months after she pleaded guilty to helping plan the murder of Dutch tycoon Herman Rouwenhorst.

Appearing before High Court Judge Ann Ong'injo on Monday, Ms Nekesa appeared subdued, her actions weighing heavily on her face.

Even as she expressed remorse for her involvement in the murder, the role she played in the grand scheme has now strengthened the prosecution's case against the main suspect.

Ms Nekesa told the court that she was a single mother of two and wanted a lenient sentence that would allow her to take care of her two children.

She said that when she committed the offence in 2021, she had already separated from the father of her children, leaving her with the sole responsibility of caring for the minors.

""My children have been staying with their aunt, who is also a widow, since I was arrested in 2021. I am asking the court for leniency for the sake of my children,"" Ms Nekesa said.

Ms Nekesa further said that during her three years in prison, she had learnt vital skills that would help her cope with life outside prison walls.

She was charged along with Mr Rouwenhorst's widow, Riziki Ali Cherono, and Timothy Omondi Ngowe alias Rashid alias Tony Ochieng' alias Mohamed Khalid with the murder of the Dutchman and a security guard, Evans Pole Bokoro, at his home.

They allegedly committed these offences on June 4, 2021, but she entered into a plea bargain agreement with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and is now a state witness.

As a result of this agreement, the State has reduced the charge against Ms Nekesa from murder to manslaughter.

Ms Nekesa pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter in March, when the court heard that she had unlawfully killed Rouwenhorst and Bokoro. She is awaiting sentencing.

But what has Ms Nekesa done, or what is she sorry for?

By her own admission before Justice Ong'injo, Ms Nekesa was the woman who facilitated the entry of hired killers into Mr Rouwenhorst's Roco apartment in Shanzu, Mombasa, in the middle of the night.

Court records show that on the night of June 3, Ms Nekesa was taken to an unoccupied room in the apartment. Her main role was to wait until the middle of the night to facilitate the entry of hired killers into the compound to eliminate the Dutchman.

Ms Nekesa and Ms Cherono were long-time friends, so she was not new to the deceased's home.

Court records show that she was previously an employee at the apartment and also had other business dealings with the widow.

The court was further informed that Ms Nekesa introduced Ms Cherono to Mr Omondi and the two would occasionally hang out together.

Ms Nekesa said she facilitated the entry of the hired killers into Mr Rouwenhorst's Roco Apartment in Shanzu on the night of the incident.

The apartments were used as residential premises where the deceased and his family lived and included fully furnished rental units.

One day, during their time together, Mrs Cherono is said to have confided in her friend Nekesa about her intention to get rid of her husband, Rouwenhorst, by murdering him. Mr Omondi was chosen to carry out the murder.

From here, Nekesa allegedly facilitated communication between Cherono and Omondi for planning purposes.

On June 3, Cherono allegedly helped Nekesa to hide in one of the empty rooms in the apartment.

""At about 2am on June 4, Nekesa helped Omondi to enter the apartment complex,"" prosecutor Bernard Ngiri told the court earlier.

To facilitate the entry without arousing suspicion, Nekesa allegedly told Bokoro that Omondi was her guest.

The prosecution said investigators found that Nekesa and Omondi went to the empty room and planned to poison meat meant for the security dogs to incapacitate them.

Omondi then allegedly left with a metal rod concealed in his jacket. Some 45 minutes later, Bokoro was found writhing in agony.

Court records show that Omondi was accompanied by two others.

The three attackers then went to Rouwenhorst's room and assaulted him, leaving him unconscious.

The court was told that an examination of call records linked Nekesa to the location and indicated that she communicated with Cherono and Omondi before and after the incident.

""A mobile phone recovered from the suspects revealed text messages detailing a plot by Nekesa and Omondi on how the murder was to be carried out,"" said Ngiri.

According to court records, Nekesa was arrested and charged as the central figure in coordinating the killings from an empty room in the apartment where Cherono allegedly hosted her to facilitate the execution of the plans.

Investigators also mentioned that the suspect had a small tenant's gate key, which she used to open the gate for Omondi to enter the compound when he arrived at the scene.

,"""I am remorseful for my actions, I have learned my lessons. I pray for a lenient sentence.""

Those were the words of Mary Nekesa Ambani through her lawyer, three months after she pleaded guilty to helping plan the murder of Dutch tycoon Herman Rouwenhorst.

Appearing before High Court Judge Ann Ong'injo on Monday, Ms Nekesa appeared subdued, her actions weighing heavily on her face.

Even as she expressed remorse for her involvement in the murder, the role she played in the grand scheme has now strengthened the prosecution's case against the main suspect.

Ms Nekesa told the court that she was a single mother of two and wanted a lenient sentence that would allow her to take care of her two children.

She said that when she committed the offence in 2021, she had already separated from the father of her children, leaving her with the sole responsibility of caring for the minors.

""My children have been staying with their aunt, who is also a widow, since I was arrested in 2021. I am asking the court for leniency for the sake of my children,"" Ms Nekesa said.

Ms Nekesa further said that during her three years in prison, she had learnt vital skills that would help her cope with life outside prison walls.

She was charged along with Mr Rouwenhorst's widow, Riziki Ali Cherono, and Timothy Omondi Ngowe alias Rashid alias Tony Ochieng' alias Mohamed Khalid with the murder of the Dutchman and a security guard, Evans Pole Bokoro, at his home.

They allegedly committed these offences on June 4, 2021, but she entered into a plea bargain agreement with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and is now a state witness.

As a result of this agreement, the State has reduced the charge against Ms Nekesa from murder to manslaughter.

Ms Nekesa pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter in March, when the court heard that she had unlawfully killed Rouwenhorst and Bokoro. She is awaiting sentencing.

But what has Ms Nekesa done, or what is she sorry for?

By her own admission before Justice Ong'injo, Ms Nekesa was the woman who facilitated the entry of hired killers into Mr Rouwenhorst's Roco apartment in Shanzu, Mombasa, in the middle of the night.

Court records show that on the night of June 3, Ms Nekesa was taken to an unoccupied room in the apartment. Her main role was to wait until the middle of the night to facilitate the entry of hired killers into the compound to eliminate the Dutchman.

Ms Nekesa and Ms Cherono were long-time friends, so she was not new to the deceased's home.

Court records show that she was previously an employee at the apartment and also had other business dealings with the widow.

Kibiko land row: Tension as two factions hold parallel elections,"The battle for control of the Sh100 billion Kibiko Ranch intensified on Tuesday, June 4 after two factions held parallel elections.

The exercise, which saw the factions led by long-serving chairman Moses Parantai and the other led by Moses Monik elect their leaders, came after the Kajiado County security team led by County Commissioner Joseph Taari cancelled the May 24, 2024 elections, citing insecurity and poor preparations by the national government.

In a public notice dated 3 June 3, 2024, Mr Taari said: ""Due to some security concerns arising from the purported annual general meeting of the Keekonykie Community Trust to be held at Kibiko grounds on June 4, 2024, the county security committee has declared the grounds a no-go zone.""

He said the order had been communicated to the two factions who had agreed to cancel the purported meeting. He said police officers have been mobilised to ensure that no one is allowed near the venue from midnight on June 3, 2024, to 6pm on June 8, 2024. He advised community members to avoid the venue for their own safety.

However, by 6am on Tuesday, the Parantai-led team had erected tents for the exercise, but a contingent of heavily armed police removed the tents and cordoned off the area, forcing the two groups to move further inland.

By acclamation, the Monik faction declared themselves the winners and left the venue to celebrate in the towns of Ngong, Kiserian and Isinya.

""My group had the right to call the elections, and the members unanimously elected me as their leader, I will do justice to all, external forces have lost,"" said Mr Monik.

At Kibiko ground, hundreds of Parantai supporters declared him as their duly elected chairman before swearing in his seven-member team. Three lawyers led him to take the oath of office and handed him the certificate. Mr Parantai blamed the Kajiado County Commissioner for postponing the elections, saying he had no power to do so.

""The 25-year struggle has come to an end, we will now move forward and subdivide the land to our members, the members have spoken,"" Mr Parantai said on Tuesday.

How Meg Whitman overcame disability and transformed eBay,"Before she became the US ambassador to Kenya, Margaret “Meg” Whitman developed an optimistic outlook. This excessive power of positivity, permitted the Princeton economics graduate and Harvard MBA bearer to transform eBay into the largest online auction platform.

In 1997, Meg operated a $600 million division at Hasbro, where she developed the business art of scaling, which enhanced her favourite business activity of solving problems. By the time she joined eBay as president and CEO in March 1998, she could instil cohesive management techniques that created eBay’s innovative success.

The company’s sophistication ensured anyone on the planet could post pictures of their products while interested clients and would bid and efficiently pay through PayPal, which was Meg's pivotal acquisition that she purchased as a subsidiary of eBay for $1.5 billion. The online auction procedure enabled Meg's development of new skills and capabilities that reverberated with clients, as the company grew larger.

Read: To succeed, enjoy what you do... and do what you enjoy

The trust she placed on people granted Meg the opportunity to set a stretch goal in September 2000, when eBay hosted its annual Analyst Day. A stretch goal is a financial projection that provides specific numbers for an institution's forecast. With eBay revenues totalling $430 million, Meg predicted that eBay would be a $3 billion company by 2005, to provide her team with an aim.

Mary Meeker, a savvy analyst who adjudicated eBay for wealth management firm Morgan Stanley, expressed her displeasure. She chastised Meg's public commitment to a specific long-term number as reckless and stupid. Mary was assured that failure to attain that goal would suggest weakness of leadership, planning, and execution, which could eventually frighten shareholders.

Unscathed, however, Meg surged on. She artfully implemented a sound business plan that consisted of a strong value proposition, which translated seamlessly into her talent pool. Her stretch goal was heeded exceptionally well as an inspirational rallying cry.

Soon, eBay began realising soaring revenues while decompressing numerous liabilities. Meg's new product innovations were consumed with receptivity by eBay users and created new emerging online markets, including the US automotive auction industry.

Meg (1)

It was at eBay, where Meg primarily adopted the chief principles as highlighted in her memoir, The Power of Many: Values for Success in Business and in Life. She led eBay from a $4 million company in March 1998 when she was hired to a $400 million business, as she transformed and scaled her managerial skills. By 2005, eBay had hit $4.5 billion in revenues, superseding her projection of $3 billion five years earlier. It went on to grow with distinction to an $8 billion virtual auction global brand, with a prosperous global marketplace.

During her tenure at eBay, the company advanced so rapidly. Meg responded by ingeniously adding exciting new acquisitions of physically disabled staff to her portfolio. Her corporate social responsibility was inspired by her childhood experience of overcoming disability.

When Meg was a newborn, her parents took her to a special hospital in New York City and doctors discovered she had dysplasia, an unusual congenital bone defect that resulted in her left hip having no socket. The hip is a ball and socket joint, the socket being a curved enclosure that contains the top of the large bone of the upper leg that allows the leg to rotate and move. In Meg's case, the surface of the hip against which her leg rested was flat instead of curved, causing the joint to become inherently unstable.

If left untreated, the implications of a child with this would result in permanent disability because the leg bone would not sit snugly in the socket, and would constantly dislocate when the child moved. When Meg began to crawl, doctors repeatedly asserted that she had to be placed in a stiff metal brace and leather straps that literally pushed her leg into her hip to create the socket.

Read: Meg Whitman, envoy with Midas touch on business

Her stroller and baby carriage were also modified to allow her legs to point out sideways, and when she was not being wheeled, she had to be carried everywhere. The strategy was to maintain a constant, steady pressure on her soft toddler bones to create the socket. It miraculously worked. It was, however, challenging for the family. Even after the braces were removed when Meg was two, she was not allowed to stand and apply weight on her hips for another six months.

When her family received permission from the doctors to let her play freely, the results were remarkable. She could walk, run and jump, just like any other child. She had no pain, and received a moment of self-validation when she gravitated to playing sports, including basketball, lacrosse and swimming, which were critical to developing her adulthood character traits of persistence and perseverance and were eventually fundamental to her administrative success.

To her delight, as eBay grew, Meg aligned the company’s principles to nurture the talents and restore the courage of the physically disabled. She integrated an entire community of staff consisting of physically challenged individuals, and explored their intellectual energy and resourcefulness, while eliminating enormous stigma that surrounded their preconceived notions and abilities. Having experienced the fright of disability, she resonated with the disparity of the physically impaired.

Kenya’s policy on family faulty on many fronts,"Anyone interested in social issues would be excited about the National Policy on Family Promotion and Protection 2023 published by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. But that excitement lasts only until you read the document.

The policy defines a family as “a societal group that is related by blood, adoption, foster care or the ties of marriage of two persons of opposite sex” (sic). This disqualifies intersex persons from marriage.

Similar discrimination is inherent in the Marriage Act, which defines marriage as “a voluntary union of a man and woman”. In chapter two, the policy defines a family as “a unit of people connected by natural genealogical links”, which is at variance with the earlier definition.

Read: Reimagining marriage and its original values

The document regrets that the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics collects information on the family but has never synthesised this into a thematic report. Thus it recommends a state of the family report after every five years.

At different points, the words “family” and “household” are used interchangeably, yet these are distinct concepts.

The statement that “polygamous households are one of the types of families found in Kenya” makes it manifest that the authors lacked a coherent approach to classification of families.

In addition, the analysis of challenges facing the family is extremely superficial and uninformed, probably an indication that no sociologist was involved in developing the document.

Under marriage in chapter three, the document observes that existing legislation does not provide guidance on how to “strengthen the marriage” but does not clarify what is meant by that phrase.

Read: Married but single: The wives paying all the family bills

What is clear is that the policy champions a normative ideology that marriage is imperative. Thus, it states that “the key policy issues are related on how (sic) to promote a culture of marriage” so that the result is “a true foundation for social order in Kenya”.

This seems to suggest that without families, there can be no social order.

The policy then proposes some vague but conservative interventions to be undertaken by the government.

These include promotion of “gender-responsive and age-appropriate programmes that help people understand sexuality framed in the context of marriage as the best option,” encouraging and promoting “dispute resolution mechanisms that safely keep couples together,” promoting “values and life skills programmes that encourage chastity and strengthen the marriage institution,” and protecting “the family institution from disruption by not allowing emerging cultures”.

Although the meaning of “emerging cultures” is not stated, it is a veiled reference to non-binary sexual orientation.

Read: Every marriage is pregnant with divorce, let’s leave room for the latter

Inlaid in these proposals are some ludicrous assumptions. One is that it is the government’s responsibility to keep couples together. This arises from the notion that marriage is a union in which people should, and can be coerced to, stay even if it is dysfunctional.

The other is that it is the government’s role to ensure sexual fidelity within marriage, notwithstanding that adultery is not a crime in Kenyan statutes. The superintending role given to the government is tantamount to meddling and erosion of the autonomy and responsibilities of couples.

The document creates the impression that Kenya is just about to invent something called the family and needs a framework on how to make it functional. The vagueness of the policy proposals means that an implementer would be at a loss as to what to do practically.

What kind of action, for example, would one initiate under the intervention to “integrate family needs in planning and property/assets acquisition and disposal?” The proposals are also littered with the word “promote,” technically an escapist and lazy way of making commitments that are not measurable.

This document has glaring, irritating and embarrassing grammatical errors. Sample this. “The role of men in ensuring family fulfils this primary function is paramount. Empirical evidence has made abundantly clear that involved and caring fathers are important to the optimal development of children.

Read: If you were to grade your marriage, what would you score?

Whether it is biological, adoptive or stepfathers, living in or outside of the home, fathers impact their children at every stage of development, and their absence has long last repercussions.”

The policy lists various statutes of relevance to the family but curiously omits the Law of Succession (Amendment) Act and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act.

The section on family safety and security does not even feature obvious types of violence such as spousal battery, rape and incest.

Reading this document leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It makes one wonder whether government officers who approved and signed this product actually read it.

In short, this is a pedestrian document that should not be called a national policy. The ministry would do the country a lot of justice by withdrawing it for a total overhaul.

What is clear is that the policy champions a normative ideology that marriage is imperative. Thus, it states that “the key policy issues are related on how (sic) to promote a culture of marriage” so that the result is “a true foundation for social order in Kenya”.

This seems to suggest that without families, there can be no social order.

The policy then proposes some vague but conservative interventions to be undertaken by the government.

These include promotion of “gender-responsive and age-appropriate programmes that help people understand sexuality framed in the context of marriage as the best option,” encouraging and promoting “dispute resolution mechanisms that safely keep couples together,” promoting “values and life skills programmes that encourage chastity and strengthen the marriage institution,” and protecting “the family institution from disruption by not allowing emerging cultures”.

Although the meaning of “emerging cultures” is not stated, it is a veiled reference to non-binary sexual orientation.

Inlaid in these proposals are some ludicrous assumptions. One is that it is the government’s responsibility to keep couples together. This arises from the notion that marriage is a union in which people should, and can be coerced to, stay even if it is dysfunctional.

The other is that it is the government’s role to ensure sexual fidelity within marriage, notwithstanding that adultery is not a crime in Kenyan statutes. The superintending role given to the government is tantamount to meddling and erosion of the autonomy and responsibilities of couples.

The document creates the impression that Kenya is just about to invent something called the family and needs a framework on how to make it functional. The vagueness of the policy proposals means that an implementer would be at a loss as to what to do practically.

What kind of action, for example, would one initiate under the intervention to “integrate family needs in planning and property/assets acquisition and disposal?” The proposals are also littered with the word “promote,” technically an escapist and lazy way of making commitments that are not measurable.

This document has glaring, irritating and embarrassing grammatical errors. Sample this. “The role of men in ensuring family fulfils this primary function is paramount. Empirical evidence has made abundantly clear that involved and caring fathers are important to the optimal development of children.

Read: If you were to grade your marriage, what would you score?

Whether it is biological, adoptive or stepfathers, living in or outside of the home, fathers impact their children at every stage of development, and their absence has long last repercussions.”

The policy lists various statutes of relevance to the family but curiously omits the Law of Succession (Amendment) Act and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act.

The section on family safety and security does not even feature obvious types of violence such as spousal battery, rape and incest.

Reading this document leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It makes one wonder whether government officers who approved and signed this product actually read it.

In short, this is a pedestrian document that should not be called a national policy. The ministry would do the country a lot of justice by withdrawing it for a total overhaul.

Inside new state policy that recognises 'come we stay' and sex education in schools,"On May 15, 2024, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection launched the National Policy on Family Promotion and Protection, a framework seeking to safeguard the institution of family as provided for in Article 45 of the Constitution.

The policy is pegged on the order of maintaining the constitutional status quo of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society, pivotal to creating social order as it functions as an entity for educating, nurturing and caring for its kin.

What kind of marriages exist in Kenya?

The policy recognises nuclear, polygamous, blended, extended, as well as child-headed and skip-generation or grandparent-headed families.

It equally acknowledges the existence of a “kind of marriage” arrangement in the name of cohabitation, where an unmarried couple lives together in a long-term relationship that resembles a marriage.

This type of marriage is, however, unrecognised under the Marriage Act (2014), and becomes problematic when parties go separate ways and demand a share of what they built together.

Single-parent families are also recognised in this policy, breaking the tradition of looking down on these families. While it attributes the rise of these families to only imprisonment, migration, death, abandonment, divorce or separation, other painful factors force women and girls into single-parenthood. Some women and girls have become single parents out of the post-election violence, incest, gang-rape and defilement in their own communities.

Read: Silence that kills a marriage

In the slum areas, teenage girls as young as 13 years are willingly opting for marriage to seek financial, emotional and physical support because their own families can’t provide these needs. Unfortunately, they end up being abused, and when they can’t take it anymore, they exit to become single-child parents.

The policy seeks to promote gender-responsive and age-appropriate programmes that help people understand sexuality framed in the context of marriage as the best option. Is this the best option?

“It is important to recognise that in this era of urbanisation and globalisation, age-appropriate programmes will not be homogeneously palatable to the targeted family members. What is considered age-appropriate in Nairobi may not apply for a family in Bungoma or Kajiado. So we must do research to understand what is best for different families,” argues Chryspin Afifu, a gender and development expert.

“We have to think of the power imbalances in the households, socioeconomic status of the family members and access to digital devices. These days, children access online content way above their age through mobile phones or even laptops. How can we control that to protect families?”

What is the current mood of debate on “sexuality education”?

For the past two decades, the church, especially the Anglican and Roman Catholic, has vehemently refused to allow the introduction of age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education, which essentially is to prepare the children for adulthood.

Yet, the reality on the ground, backed up bystudies, is that children are having a sex debut as early as eight years depending on their environment. Those in the urban slum areas and in the poor households in the rural parts of Kenya are at the highest risk of early sex debut, an easy gateway to early marriage and contracting HIV.

In 2003, the same church unsuccessfully protested against the introduction of setbooks A Man of the People, Kiu, and Kitumbua Kimeingia Mchanga, arguing that they were pornographic and sexually explicit.

In reality, some schools, especially private ones, have embraced sexuality education in their programming for even their kindergarten pupils. Often, they are delivered in poems, and songs, and through clubs and counselling or physical exercise sessions.

The way to changing the mood from repulsive to receptive

“Let’s have a discussion. What is the cause of the opposition? Sometimes the church opposes these interventions in public but in private, in their own homes, they cannot control whatever they are protesting against.

Let’s face the reality as it is and ask ourselves, what is the worst-case scenario if we introduced these programmes? What is the weight of the losses and gains? What is the long-term damage of the opposition to the targeted groups?” Mr Afifu puts forth.

Kenyan becomes first black mayor in Northern Ireland,"A Kenyan woman who made history after being elected councillor in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, was yesterday inaugurated as the first black mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council.

Ms Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who is from Mau Narok in Nakuru County, was voted to represent the Foyleside area of Derry and Strabane Council in Northern Ireland.

During the handing over ceremony ON Monday, June 3, Ms Seenoi-Barr received the mayoral chain in the presence of five Kenyans, including her brother, Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina.

“Originally from Narok, Kenya, Lilian has dedicated her life to championing human rights, social justice, and community cohesion. With a background in social work, community development and social policy, Lilian has been instrumental in fostering integration and understanding among diverse communities in Northern Ireland,” said the introductory notes.

Marginalised groups

It was her work with local organisations focusing on supporting marginalised groups, promoting equality, and enhancing community relations that attracted her to the Social Democratic and Labour Party.

“Her leadership and dedication have earned her widespread respect and admiration, both locally and nationally. Lilian's historic appointment as mayor signifies a significant step forward for Derry and Strabane, reflecting the region's evolving diversity and commitment to inclusivity,” said the briefing.

Senator Ole Kina yesterday wrote a tweet on his X handle, formerly Twitter: “With outgoing Mayor of Derry City Patricia Logue and incoming Mayor Lillian Seenoi-Barr ahead of the official handover happening today at Guildhall, Derry City. Lillian is the first black mayor. It’s a proud moment for Kenya. She comes from Narok.”

Other Kenyans present during the ceremony were Kenya’s Deputy Head of Mission Edwin Afande, Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna and Nominated Senator Prof Margaret Kamar.

Mr Sifuna said on X that he did not only attend the inauguration, but also toured some sites.

“A tour of the Museum of Free Derry has evoked terrible memories of our own experiences with police brutality and State sanctioned violence on peaceful protesters. It took over 12 years and millions of dollars for the victims of Bloody Sunday in Derry to be vindicated. Justice comes, eventually,” he wrote.

Senate Speaker Amason Kingi, who was chief guest, congratulated the new mayor for breaking the glass ceiling.

“Today’s installation of Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr is the latest in the irrepressible rise by women to high leadership positions not just here in Ireland but globally,” said Mr Kingi, adding it’s clear proof of the gains of democracy.

,"Students and their families are being forced to choose university courses they can afford under the new funding model introduced last year rather than what they qualify for and aspire to study, investigations by Nation indicate.

First-year students, who were the first to use the model, have already accumulated fee balances and these are likely to rise as they progress.

The second cohort under the model is set to join in August and September this year and many students and parents have indicated that they will apply for inter-university transfers when the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (Kuccps) opens the system tomorrow.

Students who wish to change the courses they have been placed within the same university can also do so on the university portals.

Under the funding model, students are no longer guaranteed sponsorship by the government, but instead must apply every year and are financed according to their level of need as determined by the Universities Fund (UF) and the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb).

On Tuesday last week, President William Ruto met all public university vice-chancellors and one of the agenda items was evaluation of the funding model.

Students absorbed

“VCs confirmed it’s [the model] working and in the next three years, it will have improved status of public universities because all students will have been absorbed,” a brief message from State House read.

Students, however, tell a different story.

Last year, there was a delay in releasing the funds and students had to learn without money for upkeep. Some accumulated rent arrears while universities also operated without tuition fees.

Some 134,743 candidates have been placed in public universities this year. A total of 47,872 students who qualified for university admission after attaining a mean grade of C+ in the 2023 KCSE did not choose any degree course. Of these, 11,991 of them opted for diploma courses instead of degree courses, while the other 35,881 qualifiers are unaccounted for.

Joseph Raymond has always wanted to become a human resource manager. However, Raymond was forced to drop his dream course, Human Resource Management. The 19-year-old, mindful of financial constraints, had initially selected Maseno University due to its more affordable fees for the course (Sh183,600). However, he was disappointed to discover that he had been admitted to Kisii University instead, which is more expensive (Sh206,635).

“My mother, being a peasant farmer, cannot raise the required amount. Maseno University was my initial choice since I was aware of my family’s financial capability. However, the situation in Kisii leaves me uncertain about the future of my studies,” he says.

Raymond says that the prevailing circumstances have sent him back to the drawing board.

“From the look of things, I might just opt for a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with IT at Maseno University which costs Sh184,000 annually,” says the teenager.

Awarded a scholarship

Leonard Kanga, a first year student at Turkana University College is uncertain over completion of his studies after just one year.

When he travelled from his home in Elgeyo-Marakwet County last year and enrolled for a Bachelor of Education (physics and mathematics) degree at the institution, he was optimistic that the new higher education funding model would cater for his financial needs. Bachelor of Education is among the more “affordable” courses across various universities.

Read: Scrap useless university courses, President Ruto urges VCs

Kanga was classified under the less needy category and awarded a scholarship of Sh73,000 by UF and a Sh100,000 student loan from Helb. The annual fee for his programme is Sh244,000 and so his family was expected to raise Sh71,000.

“I received Sh45,000 from the Helb loan for my upkeep and the rest was paid directly as fees. I therefore have fee arrears of Sh116,000 after just one year. My poor parents were unable to clear my fees and I was thus denied a chance to sit my second semester exams,” Kanga said.

He says he luckily managed to sit the first semester examinations after local leaders, led by Governor Jeremiah Lomorukai, intervened following uproar from many students.

“I was forced to go to the village to engage in various income generating activities so that I can help my parents raise at least Sh50,000. We hope that the government will heed to our plea and increase the scholarship for the students from needy and less needy categories,” Kanga pleaded.

*Collins Omondi sat his KCSE examinations in 2022 and scored a mean grade of B- (minus). Had he enrolled at a university, he would probably be sitting his final first year examinations.

However, Omondi did not join any institution of higher learning last year as his parents asked him to delay his entry by one year to allow his sister to proceed to university first.

Read: I took the wrong course! What do I do with my degree?

“Due to financial challenges, I wasn’t able to apply for placement under Kuccps. I tried to apply this year, but found myself being allowed [to apply for] diploma and certificate courses only but my wish is to study for a Bachelor of Education course,” he said.

2023 KCSE candidates

He reached out to Kuccps and was asked to write an application letter since placement through the portal only works for the current students, in this case, the 2023 KCSE candidates. He did as directed, but when the results were released, he had been left out and now fears he might miss the chance forever.

Although the cases might be unique, Raymond, Kanga and Omondi are among thousands of students who now have to factor in the cost of the degree courses they choose following the introduction of the higher education funding model last year. They are now forced to take courses they can afford rather than what they qualify for and aspire to study.

“Despite receiving 800 more students than last year, many programmes still have capacity for more students due to our enhanced declared capacities this year. Those wishing to join UoN can take advantage of the inter-university transfer window and apply for transfer,” University of Nairobi VC Prof Stephen Kiama Gitahi said on Monday, June 3.

He announced that the university will open its portal for inter-faculty and inter-programme transfers on August 11, 2024, one week before reporting on August 19, 2024.

However, in the 2024/25 budget proposals, Helb has a financing deficit of Sh11.4 billion, making it only able to fund all continuing students and only 17.2 per cent of the first-year students who will be joining university in August and September 2024, leaving others to their own devices.

The National Assembly Committee on Education is scheduled to have a meeting with the principal secretary for Higher Education Beatrice Inyangala to discuss the funding model.

*Collins Omondi sat his KCSE examinations in 2022 and scored a mean grade of B- (minus). Had he enrolled at a university, he would probably be sitting his final first year examinations.

However, Omondi did not join any institution of higher learning last year as his parents asked him to delay his entry by one year to allow his sister to proceed to university first.

“Due to financial challenges, I wasn’t able to apply for placement under Kuccps. I tried to apply this year, but found myself being allowed [to apply for] diploma and certificate courses only but my wish is to study for a Bachelor of Education course,” he said.

2023 KCSE candidates

He reached out to Kuccps and was asked to write an application letter since placement through the portal only works for the current students, in this case, the 2023 KCSE candidates. He did as directed, but when the results were released, he had been left out and now fears he might miss the chance forever.

Although the cases might be unique, Raymond, Kanga and Omondi are among thousands of students who now have to factor in the cost of the degree courses they choose following the introduction of the higher education funding model last year. They are now forced to take courses they can afford rather than what they qualify for and aspire to study.

“Despite receiving 800 more students than last year, many programmes still have capacity for more students due to our enhanced declared capacities this year. Those wishing to join UoN can take advantage of the inter-university transfer window and apply for transfer,” University of Nairobi VC Prof Stephen Kiama Gitahi said on Monday, June 3.

He announced that the university will open its portal for inter-faculty and inter-programme transfers on August 11, 2024, one week before reporting on August 19, 2024.

However, in the 2024/25 budget proposals, Helb has a financing deficit of Sh11.4 billion, making it only able to fund all continuing students and only 17.2 per cent of the first-year students who will be joining university in August and September 2024, leaving others to their own devices.

The National Assembly Committee on Education is scheduled to have a meeting with the principal secretary for Higher Education Beatrice Inyangala to discuss the funding model.

"‘I refused the 'cleansing' ritual that assumed I was unfaithful’, a widow’s horror","In 1996, Jane Wairimu lost her husband when she was six months pregnant with their last child. At the time, she was 29, residing in Bungoma, Western Kenya.

She had met her husband while working at the Agricultural Finance Corporation, and they had three children together. Their marriage was peaceful and happy. However, after his sudden death, she encountered unexpected challenges.

She shares with Nation.Africa how she was treated after becoming a widow and her seven-year journey of reclaiming their matrimonial property.

“Even though my husband was the fourth-born child, he was the most successful in his family, therefore the provider. Although his family owned land in Mumias, we decided to purchase property and settle in Bungoma, where his successful business ventures thrived. When he was alive, he was attentive to our needs,” Jane recounts.

Unfortunately, Jane’s husband died in South Africa in a tragic road accident. His secretary, Claudia, who was also a Bukusu woman, delivered the news to her. Strangely, before breaking the news, she suggested that they have lunch at her home.

Read: Let’s talk about the law of succession

When they arrived at her home, Claudia began rummaging through their belongings in the master bedroom. When Jane questioned her, she dismissed her concerns and urged her to eat.

Claudia then requested her marriage certificate, which Jane handed over without hesitation. Then, out of nowhere, she posed a chilling question: ""What would you do if you found out your husband had died?"" Shocked by her inquiry, Jane was rendered speechless.

Claudia’s subsequent words only heightened her distress, as she instructed Jane to prepare to wail, as is customary for Bukusu women upon hearing of their husband's demise.

Stunned and unable to react, Jane watched as Claudia swiftly gathered their important documents and some of her husband's personal belongings and took them to her car. Returning to the room, she began screaming. According to the Bukusu tradition, such screams serve to alert neighbours of the tragedy.

“As I remained paralysed by the unfolding events, my in-laws seized the opportunity to enter our home and strip it of our possessions. Fortunately, Claudia had foreseen their actions and hidden away their vital documents. Amidst the chaos, I felt too powerless to intervene,” she says.

With the government’s assistance, her husband's body was airlifted to Kenya and funeral preparations began.

Read: Widowed? Here’s a simple guide to property succession

Before the funeral, Jane was instructed by her in-laws not to shower, citing Bukusu cultural practices. According to tradition, female relatives in the community were supposed to perform a cleansing ritual on her. This ritual supposedly ensured her stability when circling her husband's grave seven times during the funeral procession. However, Jane adamantly refused to undergo this ritual, opting instead to maintain her usual hygiene practices.

Jane explains to Nation.Africa that this practice stems from the assumption that widows may have been unfaithful, and the cleansing is intended to prevent any mishaps during burial rites.

Following the funeral, Jane faced mistreatment from her in-laws. They seized all the dairy cattle from their zero-grazing unit and even took away the tractor used for farming. This marked the beginning of her frustrations.

“Despite the challenges, I chose to remain in my matrimonial home because my children were young and I was heavily pregnant. However, I decided that once I gave birth, I would relocate to Nairobi.”

Once she arrived in Nairobi, she had intended to start succession processes but was too afraid to do so.

Legal process

“I faced opposition from my in-laws. To make matters worse, my mother-in-law was living on the property, and the land's title deed only listed my late husband as the owner. On top of that, my in-laws threatened to take away my children if I decided to pursue legal action to reclaim our home.

""I was afraid of the consequences it might have on my children and the strain it could put on their relationship with their grandmother, so I hesitated to take the matter to court,"" she says.

It was after three years that she regained the courage to begin the legal process of reclaiming her property. Looking back at her hesitation, Jane admits that since her husband had not left behind a will, it was difficult.

Read: Just like sons, daughters are entitled to inherit deceased parent’s estate

Claudia had managed to sneak out crucial documents from their home, including title deeds for all of her husband's properties. On perusing the documents, she was astonished to discover that besides the 16-acre Bungoma property, her husband even owned property in South Africa.

Her efforts necessitated her to constantly make trips from Nairobi to Bungoma to attend court. This eventually led to her losing her job. Her employer terminated her contract because she had “deserted her duties”.

Despite lack of support from her relatives, she remained determined to seek justice for herself and her children. With the assistance of a compassionate lawyer and her own resilience, Jane navigated the complex legal process and eventually regained control of her assets.

What Jane went through is common among widows. This is why the Law of Succession Amendment Bill, 2023, is currently under consideration in the Senate. The bill aims to address several issues within the existing law, particularly focusing on the rights of widows.

We spoke to Senator Veronica Maina, the sponsor of the bill, and she explained that she introduced the bill because there are inconsistencies in the current Law of Succession, particularly when it intersects with marriage laws.

“These inconsistencies impact the definition of who inherits. Inheritance laws relate closely to family structures, which begin with marriage. Some definitions in marriage laws conflict with those in the Law of Succession, leading to discrimination against certain family members or dependents.”

One of the notable proposals in the bill is the introduction of the definition of intermeddling under section three of the Law of Succession Act. The definition includes removing a spouse or child from the matrimonial home after the death of a husband or father as an offense under the act.

“I know of a lot of widows who as soon as their husband dies, the in-laws swoop in and take possession of everything, leaving the bereaved family, including young children, in distress. If the bill is passed, such practices would be recognised as an offense under the Act and punishable within the law,” Veronica told Nation.Africa.

In a joint statement about the bill, Dianah Kamande, founder and executive director of Come Together Widows and Orphans Organisation, and Groots Kenya executive director Rachel Kagoiya explain what the provision would be helpful to widows like Jane.

“This means that widows and their children have the protection under the Law of Succession not to be ejected from the matrimonial home after the death of their husbands and fathers respectively. It's the first time a law has expressly provided for such with a corresponding penalty even though the penalty is not stiff,” reads part of the statement.

Read: Mum didn’t leave a will, how do we handle inheritance dispute?

Other proposals to the Succession Act seek to protect children of women born out of wedlock. “The bill clarifies inheritance rights for children born out of wedlock, supporting the principle of equal distribution regardless of the child's legitimacy or the parent's marital status. This prevents any form of discrimination,” Ms Maina explains.

Further, under current law, a widow loses life interest in her husband’s property upon remarriage, but a widower does not. The bill proposes equalising this to ensure both men and women lose life interest upon remarriage, transferring the estate's benefits to their children.

As to this, Rachel says: “Widow discrimination upon re-marriage is terminated on the basis that either spouse will lose their right to claim from the deceased’s estate upon remarriage.

“It is significant for widows for they have been losing their right to claim anything from their husband's estate if they remarried whereas men continued to enjoy the protection of the same law by being able to lay claim on the estate of their wives in a new marriage.”

Shakahola: The challenge that remains of exhuming more bodies,"The rubble of semi-permanent homes is what remains of the places where hundreds of suspected followers of controversial preacher Paul Mackenzie called home in the Shakahola forest.

When Nation journalists eventually got exclusive official access into the forest on Monday after months of a break from the exhumation of bodies by state agencies, sources had intimated that things would be different in the fifth phase of exhumation.

On day one of the latest exhumation phase, seven bodies were retrieved from shallow graves.

The journey into the forest this time round was not as painstaking as it was in the previous sessions whereby paths were bushy and it was easy for one to get lost in the vast land.

Read: Seven bodies exhumed from Shakahola forest as State resumes exercise

The routes leading to areas believed to be shallow graves of people who fasted to death in the belief that they would go to heaven were cleared by security personnel.

Along the way, there are mounds of mud, which are the remains of the many semi-permanent houses which had been built by the followers of the doomsday sect.

Some of the homesteads’ vegetable gardens have been replaced by weeds and bushes.

Although Nation.africa did not get approvals to visit the place which allegedly used to be Mackenzie's home in Shakahola, sources within the police investigations team confided that some of the dams he constructed were filled up with water during El Nino rains.

Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation began digging up 50 graves identified within the vast Shakahola forest where the seven bodies were exhumed from three graves on the first day.

The recovery of the seven bodies, which brings the total number of bodies found in Shakahola to 436, continues to raise questions about the scale of the deaths in the area.

Government chief pathologist Johansen Odour and the Head of the homicide department at the DCI Martin Nyuguto led the operation.

Read: The horror and trauma of reporting on Shakahola: A journalist's account

Although the paths leading into the forest were cleared, a challenge awaits the security teams involved in exhumation because of increasingly thick vegetation.

Mr Odour said through technology they will be able to continue with the exercise which targets 50 earmarked graves.

“The just concluded rains have complicated the process but with GPRS and previous markings, we shall continue with the exercise. The first day we managed to exhume seven bodies of which four were found in one grave while in the first grave, we found two bodies,” said Mr Odour.

Mr Odour said the exhumation of the identified graves which are scattered in the forest and identification of bodies will go on concurrently since the government has learnt from the previous exercise.

“We are asking more people who suspect their kin might have disappeared from Shakahola to come out for DNA matching since the government has acquired adequate reagents to speed up the identification exercise,” said the chief pathologist.

The government had suspended the exhumation of bodies about a year ago to allow DNA matching of the 429 bodies which were exhumed since the discovery of the mass graves.

Mr Odour said already 32 bodies of those exhumed have been released to their relatives for burial after identification.

“Families failing to come out to assist in identification of the bodies remains a big challenge that is why we are calling Kenyans to cooperate in this phase to complete identification of the bodies,” he said.

Mackenzie and his fellow suspects are being held in custody after their request to be released on bond was turned down by the court since they do not have any known places of residence apart from Shakahola which is a protected crime scene.

The suspects were charged early this year after 277 days behind bars, over the deaths of 429 people whose bodies were exhumed from the expansive Shakahola forests.

The investigations into the killings had taken the state nine months.

The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) was satisfied that, upon analysis of the evidence shared by the Director of Criminal Investigation, there was sufficient evidence to prosecute all 95 suspects being held in connection with the Shakahola deaths.

The DPP has filed 11 charges against the suspects, including murder, manslaughter, assault causing bodily harm, radicalisation, terrorism, child cruelty, and torture.

Tapping into the future: Nakuru poly turns Ruto’s joke into reality,"When President William Ruto talked about young people making money by tapping their computer keyboards in Taptengelei village, Nandi County, the Rift Valley National Polytechnic in Nakuru City was already working on the concept.

Hundreds of young people from Njoro, Rongai, Nakuru Town East, Nakuru Town West and Molo flock to the refurbished digital hub at the institute daily.

The government-sponsored programme, under the Jitume Initiative, addresses challenges facing thousands of jobless young people in Nakuru and beyond.

These include access to digital devices and internet connectivity, training and knowledge acquisition as well as opportunities that can result in decent and dignified incomes.

The initiative encourages young men and women to take it upon themselves to access digital devices and opportunities, become certified in skills for the fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and access digital jobs.

Processing data

The digital laboratory has attracted youth from diverse backgrounds, including those who have completed training in different professions.

One beneficiary is 20-year-old Deborah Ondieki, a maritime logistics student at the Kenya School of Revenue Administration.

She has been using facilities at the Rift Valley National Polytechnic for the two months.

“I’m engaged in online work, processing data for global institutions,” Ondieki says.

“This reminds me that there is a global space outside Kenya where I can work virtually and earn my daily bread.”

She wants to save enough from her online earnings to complete her studies.

The institute works with Lish AI Labs to offer comprehensive artificial intelligence and machine learning training, enabling young adults to access digital services, skills and tech opportunities for job creation.

More computers needed

Rift Valley National Polytechnic Principal, Sammy Chemoiwa, says the institution signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Lish AI Labs to help young people develop digital skills that will make them competitive in the international job market.

“We train and mentor them for six months before sending them to the job market,” Chemoiwa says.

“We usually target those still in college and those who have completed studies. For now, we do not charge them anything. We also don’t ask for payment when they start earning.”

Some 123 students have been offered training, earning Sh20,000 to Sh25,000 a week.

“This is encouraging. Some students earn more than the average worker at the polytechnic,” the principal says.

The lab operates around the clock, with at least 80 students earning enough to take care of their meals, accommodation and other daily expenses.

The biggest challenge facing the programme is the limited number of computers. There are plans to increase the capacity of the laboratory to 1,000 computers.

“The lab only has 100 computers. We have talked to the government to provide us with 100 more for training and 200 for staff,” he says.

According to the principal, strategies are in place to help the trainees invest their earnings through saving models, government bonds, treasury bills, saccos and shares in companies.

“This reminds me that there is a global space outside Kenya where I can work virtually and earn my daily bread.”

She wants to save enough from her online earnings to complete her studies.

The institute works with Lish AI Labs to offer comprehensive artificial intelligence and machine learning training, enabling young adults to access digital services, skills and tech opportunities for job creation.

More computers needed

Rift Valley National Polytechnic Principal, Sammy Chemoiwa, says the institution signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Lish AI Labs to help young people develop digital skills that will make them competitive in the international job market.

“We train and mentor them for six months before sending them to the job market,” Chemoiwa says.

“We usually target those still in college and those who have completed studies. For now, we do not charge them anything. We also don’t ask for payment when they start earning.”

Some 123 students have been offered training, earning Sh20,000 to Sh25,000 a week.

“This is encouraging. Some students earn more than the average worker at the polytechnic,” the principal says.

The lab operates around the clock, with at least 80 students earning enough to take care of their meals, accommodation and other daily expenses.

The biggest challenge facing the programme is the limited number of computers. There are plans to increase the capacity of the laboratory to 1,000 computers.

“The lab only has 100 computers. We have talked to the government to provide us with 100 more for training and 200 for staff,” he says.

According to the principal, strategies are in place to help the trainees invest their earnings through saving models, government bonds, treasury bills, saccos and shares in companies.

Unexplained assets: Former City Hall finance chief Kiamba pleads with court to spare his matrimonial home,"Former Nairobi County chief finance officer Jimmy Kiamba has moved to court seeking to have his matrimonial home excluded from the list of properties to be forfeited to the State as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

Mr Kiamba, who has filed a petition alongside his spouse Tracy Musau, is also seeking to have an order issued that they be at liberty to liquidate their property to settle the claim with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).

In their petition at the High Court in Mombasa, Mr Kiamba says during the pendency of his employment, he managed to build his income by saving.

He says he used the savings and loans from banks to start wheat and livestock farming, and he later on built hotels in Mombasa and Machakos.

According to the petitioners, Ms Musau, a career interior designer, built her business from scratch through the establishment of an interior design company.

She says she later established a beauty parlor, enabling her to acquire a property that was leased out to supplement her income from the core business.

The couple say sometime in 2014, unknown to them, EACC began investigations on them and their dealings, including the registered companies they had interests in, and it formed an opinion that they were in possession of unexplained assets.

The petitioners also say EACC filed a case at the High Court to forfeit the unexplained assets, an application that was eventually granted.

The couple argue that they tendered evidence that their young family was at least entitled to the protection of the Constitution regarding rights attributable to a family, children and their presumptive right to own property.

This, they say, means that the attachment and forfeiture of their matrimonial home would render them homeless, and deprive their children of their rights.

“Part of the so-called unexplained assets, including the matrimonial home, were aptly explained to the extent they were acquired through pooling of resources of the petitioners and loans advanced by financial institutions,” the petition states in part.

Mr Kiamba and his spouse have challenged the constitutionality of some sections of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act.

They claim that some sections of the law are in direct conflict, and in contravention of the Constitution, specifically the Bill of Rights as they prescribe a procedure by which an individual is adjudged and instantly presumed guilty until proven otherwise.

According to the petitioners, the procedure laid down presupposes a mini-trial conducted by the EACC which after investigations is incumbent upon the anti-graft agency to invite rebuttal evidence before it can recommend either prosecution or acquittal of anticipated charges against the suspect.

“It is imperative that the court invokes its interrogative constitutional mandate to interpret the Constitution as invited by the petitioners relating to conflict of laws in order to safeguard the dictates and gains in criminal and quasi criminal proceedings for furtherance and protection of the rule of law,” the petition states in part.

The petitioners are seeking a declaration that Sections 55 (1),55 (2) (b),55 (6),55 (9),56 (1) &56 (2) of Aceca are inconsistent and contravene Articles 50 (2) (a),50 (2) (K),50 (2) (n),159 (2) (e) and 160 (1) of the Constitution are unconstitutional null and void.

Upon declaration of the unconstitutionality of the sections, the petitioners want a declaration that the orders of the High Court and the Court of Appeal have no force in law.

Alternatively, the petitioners want their matrimonial home situated in Runda Water Estate, Nairobi excluded from forfeiture by the state as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

The petitioners are also seeking conservatory orders among them staying implementation or execution of the judgment and orders of the Court of Appeal pending hearing and determination of their petition.

The case will be mentioned on Thursday for directions.

Sheinbaum elected Mexico's first woman president,"Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become Mexico's first female president, inheriting the project of her mentor and outgoing leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador whose popularity among the poor helped drive her triumph.

Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City, won the presidency with between 58.3 per cent and 60.7 per cent of the vote, according to a rapid sample count by Mexico's electoral authority. That is set to be the highest vote percentage in Mexico's democratic history.

The ruling coalition was also on track for a possible two-thirds super majority in both houses of Congress, which would allow the coalition to pass constitutional reforms without opposition support, according to the range of results given by the electoral authority.

Opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez conceded defeat after preliminary results showed her taking between 26.6 per cent and 28.6 per cent of the vote.

""For the first time in the 200 years of the republic I will become the first woman president of Mexico,"" Sheinbaum told supporters to loud cheers of ""president, president"".

Victory for Sheinbaum is a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture and home to the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.

Sheinbaum is the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

""I never imagined that one day I would vote for a woman,"" said 87-year-old Edelmira Montiel, a Sheinbaum supporter in Mexico's smallest state Tlaxcala.

""Before we couldn't even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,"" Montiel added.

Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.

Read: Trump is a convicted felon. Now what?

After preliminary results were announced, she told supporters her government would be fiscally responsible and respect the autonomy of the central bank.

She has vowed to improve security but has given few details and the election, the most violent in Mexico's modern history with 38 candidates murdered, has reinforced massive security problems.

Many analysts say organized crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during Lopez Obrador's term.

Sunday's vote was also marred by the killing of two people at polling stations in Puebla state. More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico's modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down.

""Unless she commits to making a game-changing level of investment in improving policing and reducing impunity, Sheinbaum will likely struggle to achieve a significant improvement in overall levels of security,"" said Nathaniel Parish Flannery, an independent Latin America political risk analyst.

The ruling MORENA party also won the Mexico City mayorship race, one of the country's most important posts, according preliminary results.

Among the new president's challenges will be tense negotiations with the United States over the huge flows of US-bound migrants crossing Mexico and security cooperation over drug trafficking at a time when the U.S. fentanyl epidemic rages.

Mexican officials expect these negotiations to be more difficult if the U.S. presidency is won by Donald Trump in November.

Trump has vowed to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese cars made in Mexico and said he would mobilize special forces to fight the cartels.

At home, the next president will be tasked with addressing electricity and water shortages and luring manufacturers to relocate as part of the nearshoring trend, in which companies move supply chains closer to their main markets.

Sheinbaum will also have to wrestle with what to do with Pemex, the state oil giant that has seen production decline for two decades and is drowning in debt.

""It cannot just be that there is an endless pit where you put public money in and the company is never profitable,"" said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs. ""They have to rethink the business model of Pemex.""

Lopez Obrador doubled the minimum wage, reduced poverty and oversaw a strengthening peso and low levels of unemployment - successes that made him incredibly popular.

Sheinbaum has promised to expand welfare programs, but it will not be easy with Mexico on track for a large deficit this year and sluggish GDP growth of just 1.5 per cent expected by the central bank in 2025.

Lopez Obrador has loomed over the campaign, seeking to turn the vote into a referendum on his political agenda.

Sheinbaum has rejected opposition claims that she would be a ""puppet"" of Lopez Obrador, though she has pledged to continue many of his policies including those that have helped Mexico's poorest.

In her victory speech, Sheinbaum thanked Lopez Obrador as ""a unique person who has transformed our country for the better"".

But political analyst Viri Rios said she thought sexism was behind criticism that Sheinbaum was going to be a puppet of the outgoing leader.

""It's unbelievable that people cannot believe she's going to be making her own decisions, and I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that she's female,"" she said.","By

Haji Juma: I dumped technical course to pursue teaching career,"Haji Juma teaches at St Marys Primary and Junior School in Nakuru. Teaching was not my first-choice profession.

If all had gone according to plan, I wanted to pursue a career in the technical field. In fact, after completing my studies at Menengai High School in Nakuru in 1998, I applied for a technical course at Murang’a Polytechnic and got admitted.

However, as I was heading to Murang’a to join the college, I made a U-turn to join Islamic Teachers Training College in Mombasa, where I pursued a Diploma in Primary Teacher Education, graduating as a P1 teacher. I love teaching.

I dream of starting a school with a like-minded partner once I get resources. That is why I abandoned a technical course. I started teaching in various private schools in Nakuru, including Lions Primary and Junior Secondary School, Bellhouse and Gilgil Hills Academy, where I was the head of the Kiswahili Department. I also taught in Nairobi.

Since then, I started specialising in Kiswahili, and the language remains my main subject.

Besides Kiswahili, I also taught Social Studies and Science. I joined the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) in 2016. Luckily, the TSC posted me to St Marys Primary and Junior Secondary School. With the new Competency-Based Curriculum, I’m flexible. I teach Kiswahili, Home Science, Social Studies and Science. I teach in grades four, Five, Six and Seven in the Junior Secondary School section. I went to Kimathi Primary School. My best subjects were Kiswahili, Mathematics and Social Studies. I enjoyed seeing the interaction between teachers and the pupils, which triggered my passion for becoming a teacher early in life.

I admired the way they mingled and made long-lasting friendships.

I didn’t know that bug was biting me slowly and that I would become a teacher. In those days, teaching was not a preferred career among secondary school students. Most of my schoolmates pursued engineering at polytechnics, but I stuck to my teaching career. I have no regrets. My favourite teachers at primary school were the late Joseph Gathogo, who taught me Mathematics and Elizabeth Odongo, who taught me Mathematics and Home Science. I was fortunate to teach with Ms Odongo at St Marys Primary before she retired.

I advise pupils to focus more on creative activities than electronic gadgets like computers and mobile phones to boost their creativity capacity.

Extended maternity leave a lifesaver for working moms,"Josephine Katambo was on maternity leave when she received a distressing email informing her that she had been retrenched. At that time, her firstborn daughter was just two months old.

With a newborn, she knew she had to get back to work swiftly. Luckily, she secured a job through her networks and immediately started a new role.

“It was a difficult experience, especially as a first-time mom. I appreciated that my former company paid for therapy to help us transition. I started when my daughter was three months old. It was challenging because I had to prove myself in a new job while also being a new mom,” she tells Nation.Africa.

Balancing a new job with the responsibilities of a new mother was incredibly challenging. She often felt overwhelmed and wanted to quit, confiding in her mother about the guilt she felt for not being there for her baby.

Although her employer was aware that she was a new mom. Josephine didn’t ask for additional leave because the company needed someone immediately and was going through changes that required her full attention.

“Honestly, when I started my career back in 2013, I didn’t think about getting married or having children. It wasn’t part of my plan at all. I got here by accident. Back then, my priorities were different, not focused on starting a family. I wish I had planned better because nobody tells you how challenging it is when you have children,” she says.

Her experience is similar to Faith Kimathi’s, who had one of her children when her employer was only offering the three-month statutory minimum maternity leave. She says she felt rushed, especially because she delivered via C-section and had to take care of two children while recovering from major surgery.

“When it was time for me to go back to work, I had to introduce solids earlier than recommended. Balancing work and ensuring my child was well taken care of was tough. I remember a colleague commenting on my lateness, which stung and made me feel inefficient,” Faith reminisces.

Today, Josephine, a marketing manager, and Faith, a human resource professional, work in a company that provides six months of paid maternity leave.

Josephine took advantage of this policy when she had her second child.

“It was a relief. It allowed me to bond with my second child and reconnect with my firstborn, who is six years old. It also gave me peace of mind because I didn’t have to worry about work. I had time to cook and take care of my family, which was a blessing,” she recounts.

For Faith, who went on maternity leave in 2022, her experience was better that time round because it enabled her to pay attention to her newborn and two children.

“I didn’t feel rushed and had sufficient time to establish a balanced household routine. I was able to gradually introduce my baby to the bottle and wean them at the recommended age of six months old, thanks to the extended leave. I had ample time to recover physically, and I was more present for my family. I could pick my children up from school and felt more focused at work, as my baby had adjusted to the bottle and solids,” she says.

How were they able to transition back to work after a six-month maternity leave? For Josephine, she planned her work with her line manager to account for the months she would be away.

When she got back, she reconnected with her manager and team, reviewed the past months, and contributed to the planning for the new financial year. She also secured quick wins to boost her confidence and reintegrate smoothly.

At home, she made sure her baby was comfortable with her absence by gradually spending more time away from home.

Currently, Section 29 of the Employment Act 2007 provides for a minimum of three months (90 days) of maternity leave. During that period, the law mandates the employer to grant the employee paid leave.

Although these are the statutory minimum requirements, some private sector players, such as East African Breweries Limited (EABL), have introduced a policy to extend maternity leave from three months to six months.

Annette Ngugi, a senior human resource professional at East African Breweries Limited (EABL), told Nation.Africa that they started by conducting an external benchmark on maternity leave benefits and support in April 2018. This included peer organisations, a number of which have a regional presence in East Africa.

They then settled on introducing a six-month maternity leave to provide their working mothers with the support framework that will enable them to transition effectively during that phase of their lives.

“In May 2017, a bill was introduced in Kenya to double the current maternity leave offering from three months to six months. Although the bill hasn’t been passed yet, it is a clear indication of the lobbyists’ intentions on this issue. Furthermore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed for a period of six months,” Annette told Nation.Africa.

A World Bank working paper on “the Evolution of Maternity and Paternity Leave Policies over Five Decades” found that there are striking differences both within and between countries in how leave distribution for parents upon the birth of a child has evolved.

Another study titled “The Impact of Paid Maternity Leave on the Mental and Physical Health of Mothers and Children: A Review of the Literature and Policy Implications,” conducted by the Harvard Review of Psychiatry in 2020, found that paid maternity leave is associated with beneficial effects on the mental health of mothers and children, including a decrease in postpartum maternal depression and intimate partner violence, and improved infant attachment and child development.

This is why women who have benefitted from an extensive maternity leave policy like Josephine and Faith wish other employers would accord their working female employees the same privilege.

“Extending maternity leave adds immense value to the workplace because it allows mothers to return more focused and balanced. It benefits the company in the long run by supporting their employees’ wellbeing and enabling them to contribute more effectively upon their return,” Josephine says.

Extended maternity leave a lifesaver for working moms,"Josephine Katambo was on maternity leave when she received a distressing email informing her that she had been retrenched. At that time, her firstborn daughter was just two months old.

With a newborn, she knew she had to get back to work swiftly. Luckily, she secured a job through her networks and immediately started a new role.

“It was a difficult experience, especially as a first-time mom. I appreciated that my former company paid for therapy to help us transition. I started when my daughter was three months old. It was challenging because I had to prove myself in a new job while also being a new mom,” she tells Nation.Africa.

Balancing a new job with the responsibilities of a new mother was incredibly challenging. She often felt overwhelmed and wanted to quit, confiding in her mother about the guilt she felt for not being there for her baby.

Although her employer was aware that she was a new mom. Josephine didn’t ask for additional leave because the company needed someone immediately and was going through changes that required her full attention.

“Honestly, when I started my career back in 2013, I didn’t think about getting married or having children. It wasn’t part of my plan at all. I got here by accident. Back then, my priorities were different, not focused on starting a family. I wish I had planned better because nobody tells you how challenging it is when you have children,” she says.

Her experience is similar to Faith Kimathi’s, who had one of her children when her employer was only offering the three-month statutory minimum maternity leave. She says she felt rushed, especially because she delivered via C-section and had to take care of two children while recovering from major surgery.

“When it was time for me to go back to work, I had to introduce solids earlier than recommended. Balancing work and ensuring my child was well taken care of was tough. I remember a colleague commenting on my lateness, which stung and made me feel inefficient,” Faith reminisces.

Today, Josephine, a marketing manager, and Faith, a human resource professional, work in a company that provides six months of paid maternity leave.

Josephine took advantage of this policy when she had her second child.

“It was a relief. It allowed me to bond with my second child and reconnect with my firstborn, who is six years old. It also gave me peace of mind because I didn’t have to worry about work. I had time to cook and take care of my family, which was a blessing,” she recounts.

For Faith, who went on maternity leave in 2022, her experience was better that time round because it enabled her to pay attention to her newborn and two children.

“I didn’t feel rushed and had sufficient time to establish a balanced household routine. I was able to gradually introduce my baby to the bottle and wean them at the recommended age of six months old, thanks to the extended leave. I had ample time to recover physically, and I was more present for my family. I could pick my children up from school and felt more focused at work, as my baby had adjusted to the bottle and solids,” she says.

How were they able to transition back to work after a six-month maternity leave? For Josephine, she planned her work with her line manager to account for the months she would be away.

When she got back, she reconnected with her manager and team, reviewed the past months, and contributed to the planning for the new financial year. She also secured quick wins to boost her confidence and reintegrate smoothly.

At home, she made sure her baby was comfortable with her absence by gradually spending more time away from home.

Currently, Section 29 of the Employment Act 2007 provides for a minimum of three months (90 days) of maternity leave. During that period, the law mandates the employer to grant the employee paid leave.

Although these are the statutory minimum requirements, some private sector players, such as East African Breweries Limited (EABL), have introduced a policy to extend maternity leave from three months to six months.

Annette Ngugi, a senior human resource professional at East African Breweries Limited (EABL), told Nation.Africa that they started by conducting an external benchmark on maternity leave benefits and support in April 2018. This included peer organisations, a number of which have a regional presence in East Africa.

They then settled on introducing a six-month maternity leave to provide their working mothers with the support framework that will enable them to transition effectively during that phase of their lives.

“In May 2017, a bill was introduced in Kenya to double the current maternity leave offering from three months to six months. Although the bill hasn’t been passed yet, it is a clear indication of the lobbyists’ intentions on this issue. Furthermore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed for a period of six months,” Annette told Nation.Africa.

A World Bank working paper on “the Evolution of Maternity and Paternity Leave Policies over Five Decades” found that there are striking differences both within and between countries in how leave distribution for parents upon the birth of a child has evolved.

Another study titled “The Impact of Paid Maternity Leave on the Mental and Physical Health of Mothers and Children: A Review of the Literature and Policy Implications,” conducted by the Harvard Review of Psychiatry in 2020, found that paid maternity leave is associated with beneficial effects on the mental health of mothers and children, including a decrease in postpartum maternal depression and intimate partner violence, and improved infant attachment and child development.

Dear Mr President: A teen's letter to Dr Ruto,"Floods came and passed. For adolescent girls, the onset of the heavy overflow was the beginning of unseen trouble. The end of the flooding didn’t change anything for the better.

Instead, the damage caused has added additional costs for repair and rebuilding their lives. How to cover those costs is an answer they are seeking from President William Ruto. I spoke to two of them and these are their letters to Ruto.

Ladasha, 17

Dear President Ruto, I hope before you sleep you think about us.

My mother had rented me a single iron-sheet room here in Mathare, a slum in Nairobi County, where I lived with my one-year-old daughter.

Then in April, the floods swept away all my belongings. I was lucky to be rescued by men and hosted by a friend whose house was spared.

As I speak right now (May 20,2024), I’m not wearing a panty or a bra. These clothes I’m wearing are the only ones I have. I haven’t eaten since yesterday night (we spoke at midday), yet I’m breastfeeding.

I’m so hungry. My daughter got a few clothes from my friend. As for me, I feel helpless. What will I do when my menses come? My friend is already tired of hosting me. This is Mathare and life is hard.

Getting a hustle is itself a competition and people pay you as if they are doing you a favour, despite the fact that you have worked hard for the money.

Dear President, you said you would give Sh10,000 to those who were displaced, although you said the money would only be given to the 40,000 households evicted from the riparian lands.

You may say I can’t be given the money because I don’t have an identity card, but what am I going to do? I need the money to rent a house in another place and start a samosa selling business to feed myself and my child.

I want my daughter to have a future. I don’t want her to suffer like I have suffered. My mother doesn’t have a regular income. She does menial jobs to survive. Please help me.

Nusra, 15

How are you my dear President?  I live in Makina in Kibra, a slum in Nairobi County. You may not know this but during the rainy season, my menses last longer. Instead of four days, they last six days and are usually heavy.

I have to change pads twice every hour. You can imagine how costly that is to my mother. She usually buys me a pack of eight pads going for Sh80.

In just four hours, I have finished one pack. If you do the sum, it’s a lot of money. I’m distraught because the floods affected my mother’s business. She has been out of business since April. She used to run a fast-food joint near the drainage where the floods were washing away whatever they would find.

What is going to happen to me and my three other siblings? Please, help my mother revive her business. We don’t have a daddy. We only have our mother to depend on. Please help her.

Electricity transformer theft menace: Government deploys police officers to trace criminals,"The government has assigned groups of police officers in Homa Bay County the responsibility of tracking and smoking out criminals who engage in theft of electricity transformers.

The officers will work together with other agencies to make sure that criminals who steal the transformers are apprehended and arraigned.

County Commissioner Moses Lilan said the region has become synonymous with power blackouts caused by vandalism of public infrastructure, especially electricity transformers and power lines.

He said a team of police officers was trying to address the menace by tracing the criminals.

""The officers are drawn from the Critical Infrastructure Police Unit (Cipu). Vandalism of transformers must stop,"" Mr Lilan said.

Kenya Power has been reporting huge losses caused by vandalism and theft of its equipment used for supplying electricity to homes and businesses.

Mr Lilan said the latest case in Homa Bay happened in Rangwe where unknown individuals stole transformers and dumped them at a field in Rangwe Town alongside a vehicle that was used to ferry the stolen gadgets.

""Another incident was reported in Omoya. These are just a few reported incidents,"" the county commissioner said.

When transformers are stolen, criminals break them open to steal copper wire and cooling oil.

The copper is sold to scrap metal dealers for recycling.

Mr Lilan described people involved in the illegal business as economic saboteurs who do not wish the county to grow.

He compared the act of stealing transformers to terrorism saying criminals found to engage in the business will be charged accordingly.

""Whoever puts a whole village or a neighbourhood into darkness for a whole week or a whole month are economic saboteurs,"" Mr Lilan said.

,"Political confrontations fuelled by premature 2027 campaigns for governorship have rocked several counties, threatening services.

Some of the leaders embroiled in bitter infighting rode to power on the same party tickets, but can no longer see eye-to-eye over disagreements linked to alleged mismanagement of county resources as well as political ambitions by those eyeing the top county job.

Some of the disagreements have snowballed into bloody confrontations, resulting in physical injuries, and even death.

Counties in the eye of heightened political storm include Kiambu, Migori, Kisii, Meru, Bomet, Kericho, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Nakuru.

Kiambu County is the latest to witness a bloody confrontation where a man was shot dead and others injured following a violent confrontation pitting two rival camps.

Clash with MPs

One group is perceived to be allied to Kiambu Governor Kimani Wamatangi and the other is reported to be leaning towards Kikuyu Member of Parliament and National Assembly Leader Kimani Ichung’wah, Thika Town MP Alice Ng’ang’a, Gabriel Kagombe (Gatundu South) and Elijah Njoroge (Gatundu North).

Mr Kagombe was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of being involved in the shooting incident. The MP is expected in court on Tuesday.

Ms Ng’ang’a has declared interest in running from the governor’s seat in the next election and has been critical of Mr Wamatangi’s administration. The two have had running political wrangles culminating into a violent clash.

Recently, the two opposing camps clashed over the ownership of Kiganjo market in Kamenu Ward valued at Sh55 million. Kamenu Ward Representative Peter Mburu, an ally of the governor, is said to have mobilised his supporters and allocated them space in the market. He insists the market project was done the county government.

But Ms Ng’ang’a is adamant that the project is an initiative of the national government.

“It is deeply regrettable that, despite successful lobbying for Kiganjo market and extensive public involvement, the residents of Kiganjo are being denied their rightful share due to poor leadership. How long will Governor Wamatangi, through his associates, Kamenu MCA, and liaison officers, continue to undermine the national government’s projects?” Asked Ms Ng’ang’a in a social media post.

“I urge the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to act swiftly and probe the events that occurred in Kiganjo…it is time to prioritise the welfare of the people; incitement and political confrontations must become a thing of the past,” she added.

But Mr Wamatangi has blamed some MPs for the wrangles in Kiambu. He accused the leaders of attempting to seize public land surrendered by food processing company Del Monte in Thika.

Del Monte land

“Del Monte had ceded 100 acres whose title was not handed over to the county. When I became the governor, the county was allocated 690 more acres. Cartels, including politicians, started crafting a way to grab the land but I refused. I told them to write letters indicating the development projects they intend to undertake on the public land, that is when they started fighting me,” claimed the governor.

In April, the venue for a football tournament organised by Ms Ng’ang’a had to be changed after unknown people emptied heaps of manure at the Thika Municipal Stadium. Ms Ng’ang’a and Mr Wamatangi later engaged in a bitter exchange over the incident.

In Migori, Governor Ochilo Ayacko and MPs Mark Nyamita (Uriri) and Peter Masara (Suna West) have been locked in bitter political exchanges. Mr Nyamita is reported to be eyeing the governorship.

The confrontation forced Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga to convene a crisis meeting to try and reconcile the leaders. Mr Masara attended the May 8 Central Committee meeting and was made to shake hands with the governor, but Mr Nyamita skipped the forum.

ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna, in a statement, blamed State machinery for instigating violence in opposition-run counties.

“What has emerged from the briefing is that there is a clear and calculated plan to use State power to destabilise ODM-run counties and constituencies in partnership with rogue members of the party, some subject to ongoing disciplinary proceedings, who have since pledged allegiance to the regime in power,” the statement said.

Last month, two people were injured in Rapogi village, Migori County, during a clash pitting supporters of Governor Ayacko and Mr Nyamita at a funeral. Police had to fire teargas at mourners to calm the situation.

Mr Nyamita, in an interview with Sunday Nation, blamed the governor for the violence. He claimed that no development is happening in Migori as a result of a disorganised leadership.

‘Cover-up scheme’

“What we have are people who mobilise for violence against those critical of them. We have to be tolerant of each other for the county to realise its potential,” said Mr Nyamita.

He claimed that the meeting called by Mr Odinga was purely a scheme to cover up for the incompetence of the governor.

“No one has declared interest in the governor’s seat during 2027 election. We are just doing our job as elected leaders. The party should question the leadership of the county on what it is not doing right instead of asking us to go slow on him,” said the MP.

Mr Odinga last year appealed to ODM elected leaders to shun premature campaigns and deliver to the electorate.

“We have four more years to go, and this politicking is bringing a lot of tension. People are campaigning to become MCAs, and the elected MCAs are campaigning to be MPs. They have hardly served the people to qualify for these positions,” Mr Odinga said last November.

""We have people elected as MPs who are campaigning to be governors. You have hardly served the people as a Member of Parliament, yet you have already formed a committee for you to campaign to be a governor,"" he said.

In Kisumu, Deputy Governor Dr Mathew Owili, Senator Professor Tom Ojienda and MPs Aduma Owuor (Nyakach) as well as Joshua Oron (Kisumu Central) have been accused of engaging in early campaigns to succeed Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, who is doing his second and final term.

In Kisii, Governor Simba Arati and South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro have been engaged in a vicious power struggle.

Mr Arati has claimed that those seeking to destabilise his leadership are well-known individuals whose agenda is to make him lose in the next election by painting him as violent.

“My opponents have criminalised every noble initiative that I initiate, including my efforts to empower boda boda riders,” he said recently.

But Mr Osoro has insisted that it is the governor to blame for the chaos in the county. He has threatened to sue Mr Arati for linking him to the chaos that erupted in a meeting at Nyakembene market in which four people were injured.

In Nandi, the working relationship between Governor Stephen Sang and Senator Samson Cherargei has not been rosy. Mr Cherargei has accused the county boss of failing to deliver on his manifesto. In turn, Mr Sang’ says the senator is engaging sideshows. He claimed that the senator was busy hopping from one talk show to the other without any knowledge on what is happening on the ground.

Mr Cherargei told Sunday Nation that the issues he is having with the governor were purely about services. He alleged that the governor cannot account for resources allocated to the county.

“There is poor performance in Nandi County, from poor roads, no drugs in hospitals, poor governance, corruption and ghost workers and violation of the law especially in procurement for flagship projects that are not yet completed. He cannot account for the money,” said Mr Cherargei

Barchok’s headache

In Bomet, Governor Hillary Barchok is involved in a contest with Senator Hillary Sigei which has sucked in a section of MCAs. Prof Barchok has accused Mr Sigei of waging a smear campaign against his administration.

“The senator has been fuelling divisions in the county with the aim of painting my administration in bad light. I can assure you that he will not succeed and we will face him head on,” the county boss told a public rally at Bomet Green Stadium in September last year.

Mr Sigei said that he is only doing his oversight job.

Ms Karanja has accused the governor of walking back on pledges she made to voters during the campaigns.

In Trans Nzoia, there is a lull in public spat between Governor George Natembeya and his deputy Philomena Kapkory. But tension still remains, with the two not seeing eye-to-eye in the running of the affairs of the county.

In an earlier interview with the Nation, Ms Kapkory said their falling-out was because Mr Natembeya allegedly reneged on a pre-election pact, including sharing of county government slots.

The county boss has, however, dismissed the claims by his deputy, accusing her of abandoning her role as Deputy Governor to operate from Nairobi.

“What has emerged from the briefing is that there is a clear and calculated plan to use State power to destabilise ODM-run counties and constituencies in partnership with rogue members of the party, some subject to ongoing disciplinary proceedings, who have since pledged allegiance to the regime in power,” the statement said.

Last month, two people were injured in Rapogi village, Migori County, during a clash pitting supporters of Governor Ayacko and Mr Nyamita at a funeral. Police had to fire teargas at mourners to calm the situation.

Mr Nyamita, in an interview with Sunday Nation, blamed the governor for the violence. He claimed that no development is happening in Migori as a result of a disorganised leadership.

‘Cover-up scheme’

“What we have are people who mobilise for violence against those critical of them. We have to be tolerant of each other for the county to realise its potential,” said Mr Nyamita.

He claimed that the meeting called by Mr Odinga was purely a scheme to cover up for the incompetence of the governor.

“No one has declared interest in the governor’s seat during 2027 election. We are just doing our job as elected leaders. The party should question the leadership of the county on what it is not doing right instead of asking us to go slow on him,” said the MP.

Mr Odinga last year appealed to ODM elected leaders to shun premature campaigns and deliver to the electorate.

“We have four more years to go, and this politicking is bringing a lot of tension. People are campaigning to become MCAs, and the elected MCAs are campaigning to be MPs. They have hardly served the people to qualify for these positions,” Mr Odinga said last November.

""We have people elected as MPs who are campaigning to be governors. You have hardly served the people as a Member of Parliament, yet you have already formed a committee for you to campaign to be a governor,"" he said.

In Kisumu, Deputy Governor Dr Mathew Owili, Senator Professor Tom Ojienda and MPs Aduma Owuor (Nyakach) as well as Joshua Oron (Kisumu Central) have been accused of engaging in early campaigns to succeed Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, who is doing his second and final term.

In Kisii, Governor Simba Arati and South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro have been engaged in a vicious power struggle.

Mr Arati has claimed that those seeking to destabilise his leadership are well-known individuals whose agenda is to make him lose in the next election by painting him as violent.

“My opponents have criminalised every noble initiative that I initiate, including my efforts to empower boda boda riders,” he said recently.

But Mr Osoro has insisted that it is the governor to blame for the chaos in the county. He has threatened to sue Mr Arati for linking him to the chaos that erupted in a meeting at Nyakembene market in which four people were injured.

In Nandi, the working relationship between Governor Stephen Sang and Senator Samson Cherargei has not been rosy. Mr Cherargei has accused the county boss of failing to deliver on his manifesto. In turn, Mr Sang’ says the senator is engaging sideshows. He claimed that the senator was busy hopping from one talk show to the other without any knowledge on what is happening on the ground.

Mr Cherargei told Sunday Nation that the issues he is having with the governor were purely about services. He alleged that the governor cannot account for resources allocated to the county.

“There is poor performance in Nandi County, from poor roads, no drugs in hospitals, poor governance, corruption and ghost workers and violation of the law especially in procurement for flagship projects that are not yet completed. He cannot account for the money,” said Mr Cherargei

Barchok’s headache

In Bomet, Governor Hillary Barchok is involved in a contest with Senator Hillary Sigei which has sucked in a section of MCAs. Prof Barchok has accused Mr Sigei of waging a smear campaign against his administration.

“The senator has been fuelling divisions in the county with the aim of painting my administration in bad light. I can assure you that he will not succeed and we will face him head on,” the county boss told a public rally at Bomet Green Stadium in September last year.

Mr Sigei said that he is only doing his oversight job.

Ms Karanja has accused the governor of walking back on pledges she made to voters during the campaigns.

In Trans Nzoia, there is a lull in public spat between Governor George Natembeya and his deputy Philomena Kapkory. But tension still remains, with the two not seeing eye-to-eye in the running of the affairs of the county.

In an earlier interview with the Nation, Ms Kapkory said their falling-out was because Mr Natembeya allegedly reneged on a pre-election pact, including sharing of county government slots.

The county boss has, however, dismissed the claims by his deputy, accusing her of abandoning her role as Deputy Governor to operate from Nairobi.

Explainer: What causes obstetric fistula,"A large number of women in Kenya are increasingly being diagnosed with obstetric fistula, a condition that has made those affected live in shame and stigma. A significant number of women who suffer from the condition are unaware of what it is and whether it can be cured.

The lack of awareness and understanding surrounding fistula is a major barrier to seeking treatment. Women affected by this condition may not realise that their symptoms are caused by a treatable medical issue. They may mistakenly believe that their condition is untreatable or a normal consequence of childbirth.

Available data shows that about 24,000 women and girls are currently suffering from fistula, with an additional 3,000 contracting the disease annually.

So, what are the causes of fistula, and what remedies exist for women living with this condition? According to Dr Hillary Mabeya, a renowned obstetric fistula surgeon, obstructed labour without timely medical treatment is one of the leading causes.

Read: ""I couldn't control a fart"", one woman's crusade to end fistula stigma

Dr Mabeya says 95 per cent of fistula cases result from obstructed labour, which also normally leads to 70 percent of babies dying during the process.

Other causes include complications from caesarean section surgeries, cancers, sexual assaults, pelvic surgery complications, and infections, among others. Signs of obstetric fistula include uncontrolled leakage of urine and stool.

Dr Mabeya cites stigma as the biggest challenge, preventing women with fistula from seeking help.

Read: Let’s be sensitive towards women with Obstetric Fistula

""Poverty and lack of information on the condition are also major setbacks. We have few hospitals where fistula screening and treatment are done,"" he tells Nation.Africa.

He calls for early and regular screening to detect and treat the condition promptly. Obstetric fistula is preventable; it can largely be avoided by delaying the age of first pregnancy, ending harmful traditional practices, and ensuring timely access to obstetric care.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) country director, Anders Thomsen, says the condition is preventable and that advocacy is needed. He urges women living with fistula to seek help and advocates for preventive care through timely referrals to hospitals and ensuring expectant mothers deliver with professional birth attendants.

""UNFPA is committed to helping women living with fistula put a smile on their face by providing funding for fistula eradication campaigns. We will continue to support through funding, technical assistance, and fighting stigma, as stigma has been the undoing,"" Thomsen says.

Dr Karen Aura, the fistula lead at the Reproductive and Maternal Health Division at the Ministry of Health, notes an urgent need to enhance healthcare capacity through more training for doctors and nurses in handling fistula.

Read: Investing more in healthcare can help end obstetric fistula

""We have developed a training package for surgeons in fistula treatment to build their capacity. Our target is to have fistula care centres across all 47 counties by 2030,"" she adds.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than two million women live with fistula worldwide, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases occurring each year.

In Kenya, an estimated 3,000 new fistula cases are recorded annually, but only 7.5 percent of women can access medical care. This means every year, more than 2,700 women with new fistula cases do not receive the necessary medical care.

,"President William Ruto on Saturday, June 1 told politicians to stop whipping up ethnic emotions amid divisions in the ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA).

It is the third time in weeks that the President has spoken against ethnicity in politics, having done the same on Labour Day and during the Prayer Breakfast on Thursday.

Last evening, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki termed the “mobilisation and incitement” of ethnic communities against one another as a “barbaric, cruel and dangerous political misadventure that poses grave danger to our country”.

“Kenya’s ugly past experience with ethnically brewed violence should jolt us, whatever tongue we speak and whichever part of the country we come from, to resist and to name and shame the propagators of ethnic hate and the ‘us’ versus ‘them’ narrative that nearly destroyed Kenya in December and January of 2007 and 2008,” Prof Kindiki posted on X.

“Grateful to President Ruto for reminding us...to eschew ethnic politics as the sure way of shielding ourselves from taking the slippery path of hate that has destroyed many countries. Our common survival, the unity of Kenya and the security of our homeland supersedes any other loyalties we may be tempted to pursue.”

The President’s message was also reinforced in social media posts by top allies, including Majority Leader in the National Assembly Kimani Ichung’wah and Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale

Dr Ruto said he remains committed to the development of the country, irrespective of how people voted in the August 9, 2022 General Election.

“I assure Kenyans that we will never go back to the politics of ethnicity and personalities,” he said in Bungoma County in a speech marking Madaraka Day.

“The 2022 election was defining. It helped clear tribal politics and showed that Kenyan voters make decisions based on issue-based manifestos.”

The warning came on the backdrop of an attempt by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua attempting to rally Mt Kenya region behind him even as he talks of a scheme by individuals close to Dr Ruto to undermine him.

The DP has also revived the one-man, one-vote, one-man one-shilling debate on the sharing of the national cake, claiming Mt Kenya is not getting enough.

Read: Gachagua’s ‘one man one shilling’ push sparks storm

It is a stance strongly opposed by those in vast but sparsely populated regions.

It is also on the backdrop of the Limuru III summit that brought together opposition politicians from Mt Kenya, who said Dr Ruto’s administration has not been fair to the region despite overwhelmingly voting him.

The conference was convened by Narc-K leader Martha Karua, Jubilee Party Secretary-General Jeremiah Kioni and a host of other politicians.

Conveners of the summit were accused of running an agenda that could split the country on ethnic lines.

During the National Prayer Breakfast in Nairobi, the President appeared to differ with Mr Gachagua on the one-man one-vote-one shilling, saying every region deserves to be treated like the rest.

Build bridges

“I speak to you leaders as the father figure of the nation that we work together and build bridges as we have a common destiny. There will be no success of one county as against another. We must pull together and succeed together as a nation,” he said.

Mr Gachagua triggered a storm recently by demanding more resources for Mt Kenya counties, citing the region’s huge population.

“I am a believer, a proponent of one-man-one-vote-one-shilling. Resources are about the people. The more you are, the more taxes you pay. The more taxes you pay, the more you should get,” he said.

Last weekend, the DP claimed there is a plot to undermine him as the most senior political figure in Mt Kenya.

Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga then told the President that he risks losing the backing of the region if he isolates Mr Gachagua.

Governor Kahiga added that any attempt to undermine the DP would see the region rally behind Mr Gachagua.

Conciliatory tone

During Saturday’s celebrations, the DP struck a conciliatory tone, telling the President he is fully behind him.

“You are the vision carrier of our administration. Those who serve under you remain committed and focused on assisting you transform our country so that Kenyans have a better life,” he said.

In Kirinyaga, Governor Anne Waiguru told Mt Kenya residents to reject the politics of ethnicity. She said the region cannot go it alone and succeed.

“The people of Mt Kenya are in Kisumu, Mombasa, North Eastern and other parts of the country. We cannot live in isolation. We must be part of Kenya if we want to continue benefiting,” the Kirinyaga governor said at Mutitu Youth Polytechnic.

Ms Waiguru appealed to Mt Kenya residents to work with people from other regions.



“We should work with other Kenyans if we want peace and development. We are in the government because we know how to play good politics free of tribalism. Let us be careful and not buy tribal politics from some of our leaders,” she said.

She told locals to ignore leaders dividing them.

“We can’t achieve anything meaningful by working separately from other regions,” the governor said, adding that ethnic politics is retrogressive and should not be entertained.

“Leaders preaching hatred are doing a disservice to Mt Kenya. To thrive, we need other communities. I will not allow our people to be misled into separating from the rest of Kenyans.”

"In Bungoma, Ruto announces more goodies for coffee farmers","Coffee farmers received a major boost on Saturday after President William Ruto announced measures to revive the sub-sector into a profitable investment.

The reforms include a Sh6.9 billion debt write-off for coffee cooperatives and the allocation of a Sh4 billion coffee cherry fund.

The Head of State, who was speaking at the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations held at Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi, Bungoma County, said the reforms are aimed at increasing coffee productivity and enabling farmers to make profits from the investment.

“Measures are underway to boost coffee productivity from 2kg to 10kg per tree and from 50,000 metric tonnes to 102,000 metric tons a year by 2027,” said Dr Ruto, noting that the strategic interventions have led to increased value-addition initiatives.

2024/2025 financial year

He disclosed the payment of Sh2 billion of the Sh4 billion Coffee Cherry Fund, while the Sh2 billion balance will be paid in the 2024/2025 financial year.

The initiatives, he said, will ensure that coffee farmers receive good returns from the measures aimed at transforming the sub-sector into a lucrative investment.

“Our strategic interventions have led to a marked increase in value-addition initiatives. This will ensure farmers get good returns for their investments,” said President Ruto.

To boost the production of sunflowers, some 70 tonnes of seeds were purchased in 2023, with 40 tonnes being distributed to farmers while an additional 40 tonnes of seed were allocated to the Agricultural Development Corporation for seed multiplication.

The government, through the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA), has procured and distributed 500 metric tonnes of seeds worth Sh241 million to farmers in 24 counties.

He disclosed that Sh414 million has been budgeted for the 2024/2025 financial year to boost sunflower production under the National Edibles Oils Promotion Project.

Inside Ruto's bag of goodies for the sugar sector in Bungoma Madaraka Day,"President William Ruto dished out goodies during the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations in Western Kenya, promising to turn around the sugar sector, the backbone of the region's economy.

He revealed that his government had written off Sh110 billion in accumulated debt owed by sugar factories and pumped a further Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through state-owned mills.

The Head of State, who was speaking at Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi, Bungoma County, said the introduction of a new leasing scheme will ensure prompt payment of cane deliveries by farmers.

The scheme, he said, will speed up payment of salaries to factory workers and enable cane farmers to earn bonuses from investment in the crop.

“We are firmly committed to ensuring that the sugar industry returns maximum value to all actors in its value chains beginning with the cane grower. Bonuses to sugar cane farmers will earn bonuses every end of the year, like other crops,” said Dr Ruto.

The sugar sub-sector has remained the backbone of Western Kenya’s economy but is facing mismanagement issues, sparking outcry from cane farmers and workers who go for months without payment.

President Ruto pledged to revive the sector with a Sh2 billion investment into sugarcane development through State-owned mills after the completion of the leasing process.

First tranche

The National Treasury, he said, is to release the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development.

“As part of my commitment to invest Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through State-owned mills, after leasing is completed, I am proud to announce that the government has approved the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development, and the National Treasury shall shortly release these funds,” said President Ruto.

Leaders and farmers from sugar belt regions have criticised the planned privatisation of State-Owned mills, with some of them moving to court to halt the process.

Ruto said his administration was developing a farmers’ and agripreneurs database to improve access and utilisation of information in the agriculture sector to enable farmers to access low-cost farm input and ready market for their produce.

He disclosed that 6.4 million registered farmers captured in the database have accessed subsidised fertiliser from the Fertiliser Subsidy Programme.

Inside Ruto's bag of goodies for the sugar sector in Bungoma Madaraka Day,"President William Ruto dished out goodies during the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations in Western Kenya, promising to turn around the sugar sector, the backbone of the region's economy.

He revealed that his government had written off Sh110 billion in accumulated debt owed by sugar factories and pumped a further Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through state-owned mills.

The Head of State, who was speaking at Masinde Muliro Stadium in Kanduyi, Bungoma County, said the introduction of a new leasing scheme will ensure prompt payment of cane deliveries by farmers.

The scheme, he said, will speed up payment of salaries to factory workers and enable cane farmers to earn bonuses from investment in the crop.

“We are firmly committed to ensuring that the sugar industry returns maximum value to all actors in its value chains beginning with the cane grower. Bonuses to sugar cane farmers will earn bonuses every end of the year, like other crops,” said Dr Ruto.

The sugar sub-sector has remained the backbone of Western Kenya’s economy but is facing mismanagement issues, sparking outcry from cane farmers and workers who go for months without payment.

President Ruto pledged to revive the sector with a Sh2 billion investment into sugarcane development through State-owned mills after the completion of the leasing process.

First tranche

The National Treasury, he said, is to release the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development.

“As part of my commitment to invest Sh2 billion into sugarcane development through State-owned mills, after leasing is completed, I am proud to announce that the government has approved the first tranche of Sh600 million for seed cane development, and the National Treasury shall shortly release these funds,” said President Ruto.

Leaders and farmers from sugar belt regions have criticised the planned privatisation of State-Owned mills, with some of them moving to court to halt the process.

Ruto said his administration was developing a farmers’ and agripreneurs database to improve access and utilisation of information in the agriculture sector to enable farmers to access low-cost farm input and ready market for their produce.

He disclosed that 6.4 million registered farmers captured in the database have accessed subsidised fertiliser from the Fertiliser Subsidy Programme.

"Gachagua: We apologise to Uhuru, never again will we vilify our king","Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said he and Mt Kenya were misled into denigrating their ""king"" - former President Uhuru Kenyatta - adding that the ""mistake should never happen again"".

Last weekend, Mr Gachagua accused ""some Rift Valley politicians close to the President"" of undermining him and the leadership of Mt Kenya.

“Come rain come sunshine, we will never again vilify our king. We came here and vilified Uhuru Kenyatta. I repented after that. Did I not repent? Did you forgive me? We will never again vilify the king of the Kikuyu community. Let us teach our youth never again to be used by anyone to vilify our king. Let us love each other so that we get our rightful share of the Kenyan cake,"" Mr Gachagua told a rally at Kimende, Kiambu County, on his way back from an engagement in Kinangop, Nyandarua County.

Mr Gachagua—who had led a lynch mob against Mr Kenyatta and former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta—has taken a reconciliatory tone with the Kenyatta family, and has sworn to unite with the former Head of State in the interest of the populous Mt Kenya.

Mr Kenyatta had backed opposition leader Raila Odinga in the August 2022 presidential election, and President Ruto, Mr Gachagua and their lieutenants had used this to show that as a betrayal of the community, with a series of insults.

Mt Kenya Haki Coalition

A meeting organised by pro-Kenyatta allies early this month endorsed the former president as the leader of a new Mt Kenya Haki Coalition that will “protect and champion the interests of the people of Mt Kenya.”

In the Nyandarua event, a faction of United Democratic Alliance (UDA) elected leaders demanded disciplinary measures against Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja, MP Ndindi Nyoro and other youthful politicians accused of disrespecting Mr Gachagua.

However, the DP yesterday avoided direct involvement in the controversy, instead emphasising the need for unity in the central region and loyalty to Dr Ruto.

“There is a deliberate effort to disunite the Gema community. The community betrayers are still within us, but they can't win. We know their agenda is to be used by the community enemies to finish us. I see darkness, I see people plotting against the community, (and) I can see young leaders hired to divide us. Let us remain united, let’s ignore the betrayers,” Mr Gachagua said, noting that betrayers within the community have historically been used to undermine unity.

Nyandarua Deputy Governor Mwangi Mathara echoed these sentiments, praising the DP’s efforts to unite Mt Kenya residents and warning against political attacks on him.

Kinangop MP Kwenya Thuku said it was a shame for Mt Kenya leaders to disrespect the DP.

“For unity and political discipline, we must respect the DP and the President. We do not want the creation of another Tangatanga, we don’t want to go that route. We ask the DP to convene a meeting of all Central Kenya leaders to discuss unity. The President’s silence on such attacks will be interpreted to mean that the President supports what [Nairobi Governor Johnson] Sakaja and others are doing. These attacks are against DP Rigathi only but the entire community,” he said.

Nandi Senator Kiprotich Cherargei urged those disrespecting the DP to cease, warning that UDA should take disciplinary action against those causing division. “No one will separate the President and his DP,” Mr Cherargei stated.

Disrespect towards him

Kajiado North MP Onesmus Ngogoyo defended Gachagua, stressing that disrespect towards him was unacceptable.

“The DP is a symbol of national unity and must be respected. He was elected the same way the President was elected,” MP Ngogoyo said while his Kajiado South counterpart Samuel Parashina linked disrespect to Gachagua with disrespect to Central Kenya and Maasai communities. He praised the DP’s efforts in fighting alcohol consumption and supported the principle of one man, one vote, one shilling.

Naivasha MP Jane Kihara drew a comparison with Rift Valley’s political culture, where attacking leaders is not tolerated. “We respect and have accepted the DP as our leader. It’s a shame for the Central community to attack their leaders,” Ms Kihara said.

Meanwhile, a political divide has emerged in Rift Valley over the storm kicked up by DP Gachagua’s bare-knuckles attacks on Members of Parliament from the region perceived to be fuelling a falling-out in the UDA.

Youthful MPs are unrelenting in their attack against Mr Gachagua, while some of their senior colleagues and governors have backed the DP. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Emurrua Dikirr MP Johana Ng’eno and Kesses MP Julius Ruto have defended the DP, saying he ought to be respected.

"Biden details Gaza truce proposal, Hamas responds positively","WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM, May 31 - US President Joe Biden on Friday laid out what he described as a three-phase Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of Israeli hostages, saying ""it's time for this war to end"" and winning a positive initial reaction from Hamas.

The first phase involves a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from ""all populated areas"" of Gaza, some hostages - including the elderly and women - would be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Palestinian civilians could return to their homes in Gaza and 600 trucks a day would bring humanitarian aid into the devastated enclave.

In this phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last ""as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments."" If negotiations took more than six weeks, the temporary ceasefire would extend while they continued.

In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin.

The third phase would include a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the ""final remains"" of hostages to their families.

""It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,"" said Biden, who is under election-year pressure to stop the Gaza conflict, now in its eighth month.

Hamas, which Biden said received the proposal from Qatar, released a statement reacting positively.

Hamas said it was ready to engage ""positively and in a constructive manner"" with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces, the reconstruction of Gaza, a return of those displaced, and a ""genuine"" prisoner swap deal if Israel ""clearly announces commitment to such deal"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had authorized his negotiating team to present the deal, ""while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our hostages and the destruction of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities.""

Separately, the Israeli military said its forces have ended operations in north Gaza's Jabalia area after days of intense fighting while probing further into Rafah in south Gaza to target what they say is the last major Hamas redoubt.

The conflict began on Oct. 7 when gunmen led by the Islamist Palestinian group stormed into southern Israel on motorcycles, paragliders and four-wheel drive vehicles, killing 1200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel then invaded the Gaza Strip in what Netanyahu has called an effort to destroy Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that seized control of the area from the Fatah Palestinian faction in a violent struggle in 2007.

Talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and others to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly stalled, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress.

AN INDEFINITE WAR

In his speech, Biden called on the Israeli leadership to resist pressure from those in Israel who were pushing for the war to go on ""indefinitely,"" a group he said included some in the Israeli governing coalition.

""They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I've urged leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes,"" he added.

He implored Israelis not to miss the chance for a ceasefire.

""As the only American president who has ever gone to Israel at a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back, think what will happen if this moment is lost,"" he said. ""We can't lose this moment.""

The Gaza war has put Biden in a political bind.

On the one hand, he has long been a staunch supporter of Israel and would like to ensure funding and support from the pro-Israel community in the United States in his Nov. 5 election rematch against Republican former President Donald Trump.

On the other, progressive elements of Biden's Democratic Party have grown increasingly angry at the president for the suffering the conflict has caused civilians in Gaza.

Palestinian health authorities estimate more than 36,280 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel attacked, and the United Nations says over a million people face ""catastrophic"" levels of hunger as famine takes hold in parts of the enclave.

Signalling a U.S. effort to build support for the proposal, the State Department said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Jordanian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts.

Speaking to the Turkish foreign minister, ""he emphasised that Hamas should accept the deal and that every country with a relationship with Hamas should press it to do so without delay,' the State Department said.

In a sign of support for Israel despite the partisan divide in the United States, leaders of the Democratic-led U.S. Senate and of the Republican-led House of Representatives on Friday invited Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress.

The week has been dominated by the fallout from an Israeli air strike in Rafah on Sunday that killed 45 Palestinians.

""The Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war,"" Biden said on Friday. ""We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week.""","By

Bungoma gets a face lift as officials land for Madaraka Day,"Bungoma residents are in a carnival mood as the town warms up to host the 61st Madaraka Day celebrations to be held today at the Masinde Muliro Stadium.

Preparations for the big day have transformed Bungoma town, leaving residents to marvel at the benefits of hosting a national fete.

From Musikoma area, along the Mumias-Bungoma road, the mood is palpable with an improved road network and streetlights that have been erected along the key roads and the town centre.

The scope of road works includes upgrading urban roads to bitumen standard, drainage works and construction of walkways within the town.

The roads within the town have been garlanded with billboards bearing the images of President William Ruto, area Governor Kenneth Lusaka and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula.

Madaraka Day is a national holiday celebrated every June 1 of the year to commemorate when Kenya attained internal self-rule after being a British colony since 1920.

President Ruto will preside over the event that will take place at the newly revamped Masinde Muliro Stadium where more than 10,000 people are expected to attend.

Military officers and the National Youth Service (NYS) raced against time to complete the construction of the stadium.

The team was under the supervision of Interior Principal Secretary Raymond Omollo, who chairs the national holiday celebrations preparations committee.

This week, the team burnt the midnight oil upgrading roads leading to the venue and erecting a perimeter wall around the facility.

For the first time, Bungoma town will have three roundabouts at different points along the Mumias-Kanduyi road with water foundations.

Kenya Power and the State Department for Water are also on the site to ensure existing gaps are sealed and that there is a steady electricity and water connection.

The President has pitched camp in Bungoma for a three-day development tour before presiding over the national fete.

The Head of State landed in the county on May 30 at the newly constructed Matulo Airstrip loaded with a list of transformative initiatives for the region.

Ruto commissioned

On Thursday, the President opened Webuye West Technical and Vocational College at Machakha, before holding a meeting at the Bungoma State Lodge in the evening.

On Friday, Dr Ruto commissioned Mayanya-Sirisia Road and Kapkara dam in Sirisia Constituency. He also commissioned the Immigration office in Bungoma town for passport and other government documents issuance.

The President is operating from the newly revamped State Lodge.

Managers of major hotels in the town have announced full bookings.

Mr Caleb Barasa, the human resource and marketing manager at the Tourist Hotel, said the facility which boasts of two presidential suites, 15 executive rooms and more than 80 standard rooms was at 100 per cent booking.

“Madaraka Day has brought impact in terms of accommodation with an influx of clients seeking accommodation. Some of the clients are from the national government, foreign embassies, the political class and senior county officials,” said Mr Barasa.

“We have been forced to improve our amenities including the restaurants, swimming pool and the club to suit the class of clients checking in. We are also collaborating with the police to beef up security to ensure the safety of our clients,” he added.

Hunters Paradise

And at the Hunters Paradise, accommodation for its 32 rooms was fully booked by May 28.

Hunters Paradise front office manager Diana Apondi confirmed that the facility with one executive, four deluxe suites and 16 standard rooms was filled up.

“The Madaraka Day celebration has given us an eye that we are a potential venue for accommodations,” said Ms Apondi.

Governor Lusaka said the hosting of Madaraka Day celebrations had come with a lot of goodies for the residents of Bungoma that will live long in their hearts.

He said: “Bungoma will not be the same again. The economy of Bungoma will grow tremendously out of hosting Madaraka Day celebrations.”

The government allocated money for the construction of more than 600 kilometres of roads in the county and the refurbishment of Matulo Airstrip ahead of the national fete.

Some of the roads in Bungoma proposed for upgrade for the Madaraka Day celebrations this year are Matulo Airstrip access road, Makutano-River Khalaba (White Rose) Road and Bungoma- River Khalaba (C811) Road, which have been upgraded to bitumen standard.

Mr Lusaka said the construction of the roads under the Kenya National Highway Authority (Kenha), Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) and Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) was meant to open up the region and connect it with neighbouring counties.

Other infrastructure developments in the county include the reinstating of the damaged Malakisi bridge and approach roads, the routine maintenance and spot improvement of Kapsokwony-Kaptama-JCT (A1) and Kitale (B13) roads, Kimaeti-Lwakhakha (B141) road, Mungatsi–Kimaeti (B141) and (Turbo) Junction A1 (Shikhendu) (B123) roads.

Periodic maintenance

Under Kura, 28km of urban roads have been built in Bungoma, Kimilili and Webuye towns.

Kura is also upgrading 13.5km of roads in Bungoma under the annuity programme for Sh4.3 billion, including construction, routine and periodic maintenance.

“The primary intention of the infrastructure development is to support growth in the sectors of commerce, tourism, agriculture, rural production and extractive industries,” said Mr Lusaka during the opening of the Bungoma Food Security Exhibition at Kibabii University.

The county chief said his administration had collaborated with the national government to have all the necessary security arrangements and will continue working on gaps to ensure the safety of all residents and visitors.

Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa said the mood of the Madaraka Day celebration was being felt in Kakamega, as many visitors were spilling to the neighbouring county resulting in a boom in the hospitality sector.

“Kakamega and Bungoma share a lot in common and that is why we (in Kakamega) are feeling part of this celebration. I encourage visitors coming for the Madaraka Day celebrations to sample the different indigenous food and enjoy the hospitality of Kakamega,” he said.

On Thursday, the President opened Webuye West Technical and Vocational College at Machakha, before holding a meeting at the Bungoma State Lodge in the evening.

On Friday, Dr Ruto commissioned Mayanya-Sirisia Road and Kapkara dam in Sirisia Constituency. He also commissioned the Immigration office in Bungoma town for passport and other government documents issuance.

The President is operating from the newly revamped State Lodge.

Managers of major hotels in the town have announced full bookings.

Mr Caleb Barasa, the human resource and marketing manager at the Tourist Hotel, said the facility which boasts of two presidential suites, 15 executive rooms and more than 80 standard rooms was at 100 per cent booking.

“Madaraka Day has brought impact in terms of accommodation with an influx of clients seeking accommodation. Some of the clients are from the national government, foreign embassies, the political class and senior county officials,” said Mr Barasa.

“We have been forced to improve our amenities including the restaurants, swimming pool and the club to suit the class of clients checking in. We are also collaborating with the police to beef up security to ensure the safety of our clients,” he added.

Hunters Paradise

And at the Hunters Paradise, accommodation for its 32 rooms was fully booked by May 28.

Hunters Paradise front office manager Diana Apondi confirmed that the facility with one executive, four deluxe suites and 16 standard rooms was filled up.

“The Madaraka Day celebration has given us an eye that we are a potential venue for accommodations,” said Ms Apondi.

Governor Lusaka said the hosting of Madaraka Day celebrations had come with a lot of goodies for the residents of Bungoma that will live long in their hearts.

He said: “Bungoma will not be the same again. The economy of Bungoma will grow tremendously out of hosting Madaraka Day celebrations.”

The government allocated money for the construction of more than 600 kilometres of roads in the county and the refurbishment of Matulo Airstrip ahead of the national fete.

Some of the roads in Bungoma proposed for upgrade for the Madaraka Day celebrations this year are Matulo Airstrip access road, Makutano-River Khalaba (White Rose) Road and Bungoma- River Khalaba (C811) Road, which have been upgraded to bitumen standard.

Mr Lusaka said the construction of the roads under the Kenya National Highway Authority (Kenha), Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) and Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) was meant to open up the region and connect it with neighbouring counties.

Other infrastructure developments in the county include the reinstating of the damaged Malakisi bridge and approach roads, the routine maintenance and spot improvement of Kapsokwony-Kaptama-JCT (A1) and Kitale (B13) roads, Kimaeti-Lwakhakha (B141) road, Mungatsi–Kimaeti (B141) and (Turbo) Junction A1 (Shikhendu) (B123) roads.

Periodic maintenance

Under Kura, 28km of urban roads have been built in Bungoma, Kimilili and Webuye towns.

Kura is also upgrading 13.5km of roads in Bungoma under the annuity programme for Sh4.3 billion, including construction, routine and periodic maintenance.

“The primary intention of the infrastructure development is to support growth in the sectors of commerce, tourism, agriculture, rural production and extractive industries,” said Mr Lusaka during the opening of the Bungoma Food Security Exhibition at Kibabii University.

The county chief said his administration had collaborated with the national government to have all the necessary security arrangements and will continue working on gaps to ensure the safety of all residents and visitors.

Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa said the mood of the Madaraka Day celebration was being felt in Kakamega, as many visitors were spilling to the neighbouring county resulting in a boom in the hospitality sector.

“Kakamega and Bungoma share a lot in common and that is why we (in Kakamega) are feeling part of this celebration. I encourage visitors coming for the Madaraka Day celebrations to sample the different indigenous food and enjoy the hospitality of Kakamega,” he said.

How maize stockpiling in hope for attractive prices backfired,"Cereal farmers in the North Rift region who hoarded their maize worth millions of shillings hoping to get as much as Sh7,200 per 90-kilogramme bag, are staring at heavy losses as returns for the commodity plummet to Sh2,800 following influx of low cost grain that has destabilised market prices.

The poor millionaires who had stockpiled the staple for months in anticipation of better prices are now flocking the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depots, keen to accept the Sh,4,000 per a 90-kilogramme bag offered by the board as the prices nose-dive in the local market.

A 90-kilogramme bag of maize was going at Sh6,800 three months ago with fears that the prices were likely to fall following the arrival of low cost grain from East Africa Community (EAC) member states and the harvest of short season crops including beans and potatoes.

A spot check by the Nation in NCPB depots in the region revealed long ques as the distressed farmers rush to dispose of the produce to cushion them from further losses.

The Eldoret NCPB depot for instance is receiving between 5,000 to 8000 bags of maize daily with farmers expecting to cash in on better prices and prompt payment for the produce.

“We have been experiencing long ques of farmers willing to sell the produce to the board for the past two weeks due to better prices as compared to retail market and prompt payment-24 hours after delivery,” said Gilbert Rotich the NCPB North Rift regional manager.

The government plans to buy a million bags of maize at Sh4,000 per a 90 kilogramme bag through the NCPB for the National Strategic Food Reserve.

“We have so far purchased 592,000 of 50-kilogramme bags of maize but there are long ques of farmers willing to deliver the produce to our buying centres,” said Titus Maiyo, NCPB corporate affairs manager.

Most large scale farmers in the region are in a rush to sell their produce to avoid incurring losses due to the tumbling prices.

“The Sh4,000 per 90-kilogramme of maize is much better as compared to Sh3,000 offered by traders due to price instability caused by the market forces of supply and demand,” said James Songok from Kerita farm, Uasin Gishu County who has more than 1,000 bags of the produce in store.

Most of the large scale farmers were reluctant to deliver the produce to NCPB when it opened its doors late last year due to stringent conditions and anticipation the prices would hit above Sh7,200 per a 90 kilogramme bag.

“The government should allocate more funds to NCPB to mop up maize from farmers and cushion them from losses,” said Joel Maina from Moiben who has more than 500 bags of the grain.

The country realised 44 million bags of maize up from 41 million bags last season due to favorable climatic conditions and distribution of subsidised fertiliser among other factors.

President William Ruto’s administration has pledged to put in place measures that will ensure the country does not import maize by 2025.

Agriculture Principal Secretary Kiprono Ronoh while defending the Sh4,000 per bag offered by NCPB as favourable petitioned farmers with excess maize to sell the produce to the board.

“Farmers should take advantage of the government offer through NCPB to sell and store their produce,” appealed the PS in a past interview.

President Ruto late last year banned importation of wheat and maize produce to protect local market from cheaply imported grain that will destabilise prices.

He halted issuance of new permits to import the cereals noting that his administration will only rescind the decision only in the event the country experiences shortage.

“No permits will be issued to millers to import wheat or maize into the country. This is meant to protect our farmers against price fluctuation in the market,” explained Dr Ruto.

But agriculture and food experts said most millers and traders will be willing to import the commodity due to strengthening of Kenyan shilling against the dollar.

“The exchange rate of the shilling against the dollar is almost stabilising meaning that maize prices will be fair when it is imported into the country,” said John Korir, a trader dealing in import and export of agricultural commodities.

The shilling is exchanging at 130.4 against the dollar that is still hurting the local economy.Interviewed millers said the entry of maize from Tanzania and Uganda has contributed to the lowing the cost of the staple in the local market.

Tanzania is the major exporter of maize and rice to Kenya and other East and countries, including eastern DR Congo, Burundi and South Sudan.

“The maize prices are expected to plummet further due to harvest of short term crops-potatoes, beans among other alternative food crops to maize,” said Joshua Kosgei, an Eldoret based miller.

The millers want the government to harmonise standards for cess and levies across the counties to facilitate steady flow of maize to sustain operations and stabilise prices.

,"Since early 2000, Kenya has increased the number of security installations in Lamu County, which has helped make the county safer, boosting the local, national and regional economy, but wrinkles persist on land acquisitions and residents’ access to fishing and other economic activities.

Lamu is rich in military bases.

Apart from the American Manda Magogoni Naval Base, there are camps manned by Kenyan military in places like Bar'goni, Baure, Milimani, Mkunumbi, Bodhei, Saurian, Mararani, Mangai, Kiunga among others.

Residents have since benefited from the security installations, especially in Manda Bay, which has led to increased investment in both the public and private sectors.

The development of Lamu Port, various Lamu Ports South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor (Lapsset) projects and private individuals have benefited from the security provided by the Lamu-based security officers.

Recent developments indicate that Kenya is making progress in securing its ports and maritime space.

As a result, the International Maritime Organisation has removed the country as a high-risk area due to its success in tackling the challenges of piracy.

The American Manda airfield, which supports Kenya in various operations in the country and sub-Saharan Africa, played a key role in the capture of Kismayu by the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) in September 2012.

According to locals, the presence of US military at the Naval Base in Magogoni, Manda Bay Island, Lamu County is critical to the region’s peace and stability.

The base is located in part of the expansive Boni Forest, where Operation Amani Boni aimed at flushing out al-Shabaab militants believed to be hiding in the dense forest, has been ongoing since 2015.

The KDF has a base next to the American naval base, and has been complementing each other in the operation.

Community members, especially elders interviewed by the Nation on Friday, commended the State for establishing such an important facility in Lamu.

Ali Kea, an elder of Magogoni village, about 400 metres from the Kenyan and American military bases, said the community will continue to cooperate with security agencies to ensure continued peace and stability in Lamu.

""We are happy as a community that the military bases are in Manda Bay Island. We will cooperate and support all the government's security efforts for the betterment of Lamu and Kenya,"" Mr Kea said.

""In recent years, Lamu has been peaceful, thanks to the ongoing Operation Amani Boni and the simultaneous presence of the Manda Bay military bases. It has protected the community from external attacks.""

But as military bases continue to occupy more of Lamu and part of Tana River counties, the National Land Commission's recent plan to acquire 5,000 acres has not gone down well with locals.

The community says they should be well compensated as the vast land is used for grazing and farming.

""In October 2021, the government in a gazette notice announced its intention to acquire more than 5,000 acres in Lamu and Tana River counties to expand the base. What we are demanding is that we should be well compensated to start other businesses as it will affect our economic lives,"" said Aden Bule.

The Manda base, which operates as a KDF Forward Operations Base (FOB), was established in 1992 and officially inaugurated in 1995 to provide logistical support to Kenyan military units stationed in Northern Kenya and Kismayu.

Over the years, the Kenyan base has grown to include an all-weather airstrip with night landing capability and a 1.3 kilometre runway.

US and Kenya last week, during President William Ruto State visit, agreed to lengthen the runway in the American base.

“Underscoring our shared commitment in the fight against terrorism, US and Kenyan officials plan to sign a memorandum of understanding to expand the Manda Bay Airfield in coastal Kenya by building a 10,000-foot runway. The expanded facility provides Kenya the required infrastructure to increase operations against the terrorist group al-Shabaab,” a White House communication said.

Government Spokesman Isaac Mwaura on Friday quantified the security deals Kenya inked — including helicopters, armoured vehicles and other support — from the US trip at Sh130 billion.

“Kenya secured over Sh 130 billion in joint efforts to improve regional security, combat terrorism, and enhance border security; as well as support for Kenyan security forces through training and equipment,” he said.

It is worth noting that for over a decade, Lamu has been battling insecurity incidents caused by al-Shabaab militants from neighbouring Somalia.

This has led to the death of scores of security personnel and civilians.

The worst Shabaab attack in Lamu is that of June 15, 2014 in Mpeketoni and Kibaoni towns, that left more than 90 people dead, over 30 houses and 40 vehicles burnt in one night alone.

Subsequent attacks also occurred in Witu, Hindi and Boni Forest villages.

The situation prompted the national government to launch a multi-agency security operation dubbed 'Linda Boni' in September 2015 to flush out the terrorists believed to be hiding in the dense Boni Forest.

The operation has undergone several transformations from Linda Boni, Boni Enclave Campaign, Operation Fagia Msitu, and now Operation Amani Boni.

It comprises the KDF, National Police Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service and National Government Administration Officers with KDF as the lead agency.

,"A series of statements disowning an announcement by United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary General Cleophas Malala has exposed the rabble-rousing politician as a man under siege.

Informally, some party officials say he is a marked man and could be on his way out of his swanky office at the Hustler Plaza on Ngong Road, which he has occupied for just a year and two months.

Mr Malala – a one-time Member of County Assembly and former Kakamega Senator – has been having long-running trouble with some influential UDA members, but the dramatic events of Thursday could be a pointer that he has lost favour with the owners of the party.

This came days after his warnings about utterances supposedly dividing the party was met with strong reactions.

The politician with razor-sharp tongue was brought in UDA by President Ruto in March 2023 from Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress (ANC), on whose ticket he unsuccessfully contested for Kakamega governorship.

Even at his former party of ANC, Mr Malala had a troubled stay with party officials. He survived expulsion on the basis of a long and winding legal process after falling out with Mr Mudavadi.

He is always courting controversies just like in his other life of writing and directing plays.

When he joined UDA, Mr Malala hit the ground running with lofty ideas of a one-party dream for President Ruto with August deadlines to boot.

He also demanded to be co-opted in the Cabinet the same way former Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju was. He got a flag to fly. The flag comes with privileges like evading traffic jams.

But his entry rattled some of the Kenya Kwanza affiliate partners, especially the ANC and Ford Kenya of National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula, as he became pushy in calling for their folding. He went to the extent of calling them village political parties.

“I resigned from ANC because I wanted to show my ANC people the way. I wanted to show them leadership. Like John the Baptist, I came to prepare the way for them. They will eventually come to this merger and know that they can be easily accommodated. I resigned to join the UDA to give ANC the confidence that having one strong party is not a bad idea,” he told Nation in a previous interview.

But things have taken a dramatic twist for the man at the ruling party. On Thursday night, a frustrated Malala shared a video lamenting how he had lost control of the UDA official Facebook page.

He claimed the account had been hacked by an individual who is not a member of the UDA secretariat.

This was after his statement purporting to postpone West Pokot constituency elections was roundly dismissed by other party officials, who, ordinarily, would be answerable to him as the party spokesperson.

Sources at the party told the Saturday Nation that administrators of the Facebook page, who are allied to him, were last night stripped of their roles following an order from “above.”

This assertion was confirmed by Communication Strategist at State House Dennis Itumbi, who dismissed the hacking claims.

“The UDA pages are safe across social media, ignore anyone saying anything to the contrary. On Matters UDA elections, ignore Malala. Only the National Elections Board can issue statements on the election,” said Mr Itumbi, who is close to Dr Ruto.

The embattled party secretary general did not respond to our queries over his troubles at the party. Mr Malala on Thursday evening caused confusion in the party when he purportedly postponed the ongoing party elections in West Pokot.

“In adherence to the UDA Party constitution and to respect the integrity of the party's organs, we hereby postpone the planned constituency elections in the affected constituencies to a later date that will be communicated by the National Elections Board,” said Mr Malala.

But this position was roundly dismissed by UDA National Elections Board (NEB) chair Anthony Mwaura, the party’s Electoral and Nomination Disputes Resolution Committee (ENDRC) vice chairperson Adrian Kamotho and UDA executive director Nicodemous Bore.

“Reference is made to a notice by the acting secretary general purporting to postpone the ongoing elections in West Pokot County. Article 21 of the UDA constitution establishes the National Elections Board as an independent organ of the party that must act independent of any direction from anybody or any party organ,” said Mr Mwaura.

“Resultantly, any notice purporting to address election matters is unlawful, without basis and is, therefore, null and void. The UDA party will carry on with all the constituency level elections scheduled to take place tomorrow, 31/5/2024, in compliance with the earlier notice.”

Dr Kamotho also dismissed the ruling that Mr Malala relied on postponing the elections as fake, adding it did not emanate from the committee.

“Our attention is drawn to a public notice issued by the acting secretary general of the UDA party purporting to reference an order of the Electoral and Nomination Disputes Resolution Committee. The referenced order is FAKE and the same did not emanate from the ENDRC,” said Dr Kamotho.

Trouble started when some UDA leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Boni Khalwale and Didmus Barasa (Kimilili MP), accused him of trying to interfere in the party elections.

Senator Khalwale had petitioned the party to restrain Mr Malala from discharging the mandate of his office because of his interests.

Mr Barasa told the Saturday Nation that Mr Malala has been operating like a gun for hire in the party. He described him as an inexperienced politician who cannot lead a ruling outfit.

“Because he has positioned himself as a gun for hire, we will mobilise party members to kick him out of the party,” said Mr Barasa.

On Wednesday, when he triggered yet another storm by reprimanding politicians perceived to be attacking Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, Mr Malala was roundly attacked by a section of UDA politicians, some demanding his resignation.

“Ag SG Malala in UDA is like a square peg in a round hole. He doesn't fit. I have said it before and I repeat. We must get rid of him in the coming UDA elections,” said Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga.

“We have come from an era of being gagged and threatened for speaking our minds. UDA was never built on such tenets and the earlier our ANC acting SG in UDA understood that, the better for him,” added the county boss.

An alleged Sh200 million price for the procurement of election tablets is also said to have caused boardroom wars at the party.

Dr Ruto is said to have stopped the procurement of 10,000 election tablets at a price of Sh200 million.

Some top party officials are said to have settled on a local supplier, who quoted $150 (Sh20,250) per unit.

The figure was estimated at Sh25,000 based on the exchange rate at that time, inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT), according to officials.

In a previous interview with Nation, Mr Malala admitted that the initial supplier had quoted Sh25,000 per unit. Mr Malala said Dr Ruto himself later sourced the tablets from China at $75 (Sh10,125), a half of the initial quotation.

“In Kenya, the tablets cost Sh25,000 per piece. When we scouted for the tablets, we thought we could get them locally, but suppliers made a quotation of about Sh22,000. It was coming to Sh25,000 when you include VAT. It was too expensive,” Mr Malala said.

“The boss (President) procured directly from a manufacturer in China. It was procured at $75 (Sh10,125),” he said.

This is the gendered impact of amendments to the Land Act,"Presently, the National Assembly is seeking comments from the public on the Land (Amendment) Bill, 2022, which intends to amend Section 12 of the Land Act (2012) on allocation of public land.

The proposed amendments introduce provisions allowing registration of public land, such that the registrar of lands can issue a certificate of title to a public entity for the public land allocated by the National Land Commission.

Read: Why it's not enough for women to own land

The registrar is also to register land set aside by people or land-buying companies for a public purpose, but it’s silent on issuance of certificate of title.

But how will these amendments affect women?  I speak to Faith Alubbe, chief executive officer at Kenya Land Alliance.

What's the gendered impact of the amendments?

First of all, the bill seeks to introduce new provisions on the management and administration of public land. The issue of special groups like women is missing from the bill.

What about the women who live on public land in areas like Nairobi and others where colonial legacies exist? The bill is not clear whether such women have a right to demand interests in the property.

The bill talks about government-to-government land allocation and we were wondering if women are in these lands.

Read: Women's role on land committees reduced to 'decoration'

Isn’t it important to note that the Matrimonial Property Act points out how matrimonial property should be divided.

There was a clause where they were talking about reciprocal interventions between State to State in instances where there are large scale investments, the gendered impact of amendment of Section 12 is not clear.

How would you describe the women's awareness of the amendments?

It’s quite sad to note that women haven’t been involved in the public participation process of amending Section 12 of the Land Act (2012) through the Land Amendment Bill (2022).

It has been a practice with this government to make policy decisions in exclusion of the right holders, yet they are the ones impacted.

The right holders who are the women need to be heard.  The amendments should be disseminated to the women for them to give their views.

Who is to blame?

The government is to blame for the failure to distribute the proposed amendments. The law provides that when a policy decision is being made, the government should make deliberate efforts to engage the public by sharing the information. So the government has the responsibility to educate the women of the amendments and invite them to submit their contributions.

What's the danger of excluding women in the making of land-related laws?

It’s dangerous to exclude a section of the population from decision-making. Remember Article 10 of the Constitution talks about inclusion. Article 27(3) talks about non-discrimination. So, the government should not be a perpetrator of injustices against women. The government is the custodian of the law. It should ensure there is participation, inclusion and engagement of the women. Policies that exclude women should be challenged in the court of law because they lack social legitimacy.

Has KLA raised its voice about the amendments?

KLA brought together organisations working with women across Kenya to look at the amendments and the engendered impact of the amendments. Collectively, they wrote a memorandum, which they submitted to the clerk of the National Assembly, and we hope our recommendations will be acted upon.

,"A series of statements disowning an announcement by United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary General Cleophas Malala has exposed the rabble-rousing politician as a man under siege.

Informally, some party officials say he is a marked man and could be on his way out of his swanky office at the Hustler Plaza on Ngong Road, which he has occupied for just a year and two months.

Mr Malala – a one-time Member of County Assembly and former Kakamega Senator – has been having long-running trouble with some influential UDA members, but the dramatic events of Thursday could be a pointer that he has lost favour with the owners of the party.

This came days after his warnings about utterances supposedly dividing the party was met with strong reactions.

The politician with razor-sharp tongue was brought in UDA by President Ruto in March 2023 from Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress (ANC), on whose ticket he unsuccessfully contested for Kakamega governorship.

Even at his former party of ANC, Mr Malala had a troubled stay with party officials. He survived expulsion on the basis of a long and winding legal process after falling out with Mr Mudavadi.

He is always courting controversies just like in his other life of writing and directing plays.

When he joined UDA, Mr Malala hit the ground running with lofty ideas of a one-party dream for President Ruto with August deadlines to boot.

He also demanded to be co-opted in the Cabinet the same way former Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju was. He got a flag to fly. The flag comes with privileges like evading traffic jams.

But his entry rattled some of the Kenya Kwanza affiliate partners, especially the ANC and Ford Kenya of National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula, as he became pushy in calling for their folding. He went to the extent of calling them village political parties.

“I resigned from ANC because I wanted to show my ANC people the way. I wanted to show them leadership. Like John the Baptist, I came to prepare the way for them. They will eventually come to this merger and know that they can be easily accommodated. I resigned to join the UDA to give ANC the confidence that having one strong party is not a bad idea,” he told Nation in a previous interview.

But things have taken a dramatic twist for the man at the ruling party. On Thursday night, a frustrated Malala shared a video lamenting how he had lost control of the UDA official Facebook page.

He claimed the account had been hacked by an individual who is not a member of the UDA secretariat.

This was after his statement purporting to postpone West Pokot constituency elections was roundly dismissed by other party officials, who, ordinarily, would be answerable to him as the party spokesperson.

Sources at the party told the Saturday Nation that administrators of the Facebook page, who are allied to him, were last night stripped of their roles following an order from “above.”

This assertion was confirmed by Communication Strategist at State House Dennis Itumbi, who dismissed the hacking claims.

“The UDA pages are safe across social media, ignore anyone saying anything to the contrary. On Matters UDA elections, ignore Malala. Only the National Elections Board can issue statements on the election,” said Mr Itumbi, who is close to Dr Ruto.

The embattled party secretary general did not respond to our queries over his troubles at the party. Mr Malala on Thursday evening caused confusion in the party when he purportedly postponed the ongoing party elections in West Pokot.

“In adherence to the UDA Party constitution and to respect the integrity of the party's organs, we hereby postpone the planned constituency elections in the affected constituencies to a later date that will be communicated by the National Elections Board,” said Mr Malala.

But this position was roundly dismissed by UDA National Elections Board (NEB) chair Anthony Mwaura, the party’s Electoral and Nomination Disputes Resolution Committee (ENDRC) vice chairperson Adrian Kamotho and UDA executive director Nicodemous Bore.

“Reference is made to a notice by the acting secretary general purporting to postpone the ongoing elections in West Pokot County. Article 21 of the UDA constitution establishes the National Elections Board as an independent organ of the party that must act independent of any direction from anybody or any party organ,” said Mr Mwaura.

“Resultantly, any notice purporting to address election matters is unlawful, without basis and is, therefore, null and void. The UDA party will carry on with all the constituency level elections scheduled to take place tomorrow, 31/5/2024, in compliance with the earlier notice.”

Dr Kamotho also dismissed the ruling that Mr Malala relied on postponing the elections as fake, adding it did not emanate from the committee.

“Our attention is drawn to a public notice issued by the acting secretary general of the UDA party purporting to reference an order of the Electoral and Nomination Disputes Resolution Committee. The referenced order is FAKE and the same did not emanate from the ENDRC,” said Dr Kamotho.

Trouble started when some UDA leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Boni Khalwale and Didmus Barasa (Kimilili MP), accused him of trying to interfere in the party elections.

Senator Khalwale had petitioned the party to restrain Mr Malala from discharging the mandate of his office because of his interests.

,"The infighting in President William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) is reminiscent of the discord that rocked his predecessor's Jubilee Party.

Forged for the 2017 General Election, Jubilee was initially designed to be a behemoth that would outlive its founders. It was to follow in the footsteps of the Chinese Communist Party.

The party dramatically disintegrated when then-President Uhuru Kenyatta fell out with his deputy Ruto.

Jubilee was at first a coalition between Mr Kenyatta's The National Alliance (TNA) and Dr Ruto's United Republican Party (URP), two parties formed ahead of the 2013 elections.

They came together and brought in other parties to form what was considered a hard-to-beat political machine. The party that had majority MPs during Mr Kenyatta’s tenure has become a pale shadow of its former self.

It was formed in the run-up to the 2017 General Election when 12 parties folded. Mr Kenyatta and Dr Ruto envisaged a giant party that would outlive them.

They would later dispatch a team of top officials to Beijing for training in how to manage such a political party.

The plan was to avoid the journey to the graveyard that had been walked by nearly all past powerful ruling parties from Kanu of former Presidents Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Moi and the National Rainbow Coalition and the Party of National Unity of Mwai Kibaki.

UDA could be heading in the same direction if factions do not unite. It is seeking to borrow from the Chinese Communist Party, but at the same time having similar squabbles that consigned Jubilee to the crematorium.

UDA Secretary-General Cleophas Malala, who fuelled the squabbles by demanding the resignation of Cabinet Secretaries Kipchumba Murkomen (Roads and Transport) and Moses Kuria (Public Service), was ironically from Beijing for training in managing political outfits.

“During our time in China, the UDA delegation engaged in meaningful discussions with our counterparts in the Communist Party. We explored areas of mutual interest, including economic collaboration, infrastructure and development,” Mr Malala said immediately after landing at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi.

The UDA secretary-general then fanned the flames of the split in the party.

A split between President Ruto and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua ould threaten the UDA dream.

At the height of their falling-out, Dr Ruto accused Mr Kenyatta of ""damaging"" Jubilee by agreeing to work with opposition Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga.

“These people have destroyed a national party. Now they want everyone to establish a regional party. The UDA is for Kenya and cannot fit in one ethnic group,” Dr Ruto during the campaigns in 2022.

“A party is built on trust. You must work with people, not underestimate them. Don’t look down on people. Even the smallest in the party have something to say.”

In the UDA squabbles, Mr Gachagua has talked of a scheme by the President's allies to cut his influence in Mt Kenya.

“A few politicians around the President want to meddle with Mt Kenya politics to fight me. Politics in Mt Kenya is complicated and we hate betrayal,"" he said in Uasin Gishu last Saturday.

“Mt Kenya has never interfered with Rift Valley politics. We deserve respect.”

Mr Gachagua's allies talk of an attempt to undermine him by propping up other leaders in Mt Kenya.

“The feeble attempts at fighting Riggy G will ultimately bring the Mountain together and keep the Mountain solidly behind him,” Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga said.

Read: Gachagua dismisses talk of bad blood between him and President Ruto

“Betrayal is sacrilegious for the Mountain. This is the sole reason the mountain stood with President Ruto.”

UDA Organising Secretary Vincent Musyoka said the civil war could sound the death knell for UDA. He said the disputes have the potential of leaving a trail of political casualties, like it happened in Jubilee when allies of Dr Ruto were kicked out of their roles in the party, Senate and National Assembly.

“Some of us were victims of divisions. We know how it started and how it ended in Jubilee,” the Mwala MP said.

“Those of us who know what happened in the last regime are reluctant to encourage what is happening in UDA. If there are issues, they should be sorted without splitting the party.”

The party’s founding chairman Johnson Muthama, who is currently serving as Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) member, also expressed similar fears that the party risks following in Jubilee footsteps.

“As one of the leaders who worked tirelessly for the formation of this government, I believe our administration is still too young to have conspicuous cracks and in case there are some teething issues, let us use our internal mechanisms to iron them without exposing ourselves the way it has happened recently,” said Mr Muthama.

In a previous interview with Nation, Mr Malala talked of how UDA would avoid pitfalls that plagued Jubilee.

Read: Raila factor in new Ruto, Gachagua rift

“Jubilee failed because of the political characters who were running that agenda. They were not genuine and were only after advancing their egoistic interests. President Ruto is genuine and sincere,” Mr Malala said.

He said that when the Kenya Kwanza Alliance was formed, it was made clear that it was a merger of peers and ideas as opposed to the formation of Jubilee.

“When we were forming Kenya Kwanza, we told citizens that the alliance is a merger of peers and ideas. We were not just merging to get power. We wanted to make Kenya work. We want to deal with the many problems the country is facing,” said Mr Malala.

“We are not really benchmarking with the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa, the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Tanzania’s Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM). We want to have a party that will be benchmarked by the coming generations.”

In March, UDA reached out to China's ruling party in a bid to transform itself into a formidable political outfit.

UDA is seeking funding to the tune of Sh1 billion from the Chinese party to support its political activities.

The party is also seeking the support of the Communist Party of China to build its official and permanent party headquarters on a piece of land that they have already procured in Nairobi.

Explainer: What happens next in South Africa after ANC loses majority?,"For the first time in South Africa's democratic era, the African National Congress (ANC) will have to seek a coalition partner to govern with after it was on course to fall well short of a majority in the national election.

Here are scenarios of what could happen next in South Africa and which parties the ANC might partner with:

Will Ramaphosa get ousted?

With results in from over 60 per cent of polling stations, the ANC had just under 42 per cent of votes, by far its worst result since democratic elections began after the end of apartheid in 1994 and leaving it short of a majority in parliament.

Some political analysts say this could lead to party leader and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa having to step down.

Over the past four electoral cycles the ANC's share of the vote gradually dropped, but never by more than five percentage points from one election to the next.

If the vote share of 42 per cent or below is confirmed, the party could seek to oust Ramaphosa as its leader and nominate another high-profile politician such as Deputy President Paul Mashatile or Gwede Mantashe, currently in charge of the mines and energy ministry, to the National Assembly to elect as South African president.

A more probable scenario could see Ramaphosa carry on for a while to broker a coalition deal with another party in a bid to secure a parliamentary majority and then hand over to a successor, analysts say.

Asked on Friday whether Ramaphosa would have to resign after the dismal election result, ANC First Deputy Secretary-General Nomvula Mokonyane said: ""Nobody is going to resign.""

In any case, the ANC needs to move quickly as the constitution says the new National Assembly must convene within 14 days of the election results being declared, which is due to happen on Sunday, to elect a new president.

Who are the potential coalition partners?

Depending on the final numbers, the ANC may have no choice but to seek support from one of its larger rivals: the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, or the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).

The price of a deal with either of those would likely be significant policy concessions by the ANC, as well as the offer of some senior government positions for their partner.

Analysts say it is difficult to envisage a stable arrangement under this scenario, and South Africa could be facing a period of unprecedented government volatility.

Investors and the business community would prefer a deal with the DA, which has received 23 per cent of votes counted so far, and is seen as more market-friendly.

However, many analysts think the ideological divide between the ANC and the leading opposition party is so wide as to make such a deal difficult, if not impossible.

Led by Julius Malema, a former leader of the ANC's youth wing, the EFF may be a more natural fit for the ANC, but relations are tense between Malema and some ANC factions.

The EFF, on 9.5 per cent of the vote, said in April it would partner with the ANC if it got the powerful post of finance minister.

The ANC, which has not disclosed its thinking on any non-majority scenario, would be unlikely to agree to this unless it were hugely weakened.

Steven Friedman, an academic affiliated with the University of Johannesburg and Rhodes University, said it was hard to imagine the ANC and the EFF governing together for five years.

He cited their inability last year to agree on a constitutional change on land reform even though their positions on the issue are closely aligned.

A deal with the MK, currently emerging as the third biggest party with around 12 per cent, would also be difficult to digest for the ANC, which struggled to clean its reputation after the corruption scandals of the Zuma era.

""What we do know now is that the ANC is in a trilemma,"" said Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, a political analyst at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

""The ANC will have to decide whether it goes with its historical partners, the EFF and MK, or whether it takes an unprecedented step of reaching across the aisle of South African politics in a grand coalition with the DA.

""Anyone of those coalitions is politically unprecedented,"" he said. ""It remains to be seen to what extent that represents a true policy shift in South Africa.""

Less likely scenarios

If the ANC gets a last-minute boost to secure over 45 per cent of the vote, which looks out of reach at this stage, it could try to make a deal with small- or medium-sized parties to form a government.

"Court upholds 20-year sentence for teacher who defiled, impregnated 14-year-old pupil","A former teacher at Tembo Primary School will serve a 20-year prison sentence for defiling a 14-year-old pupil after exhausting all legal avenues to regain his freedom.

David Langat was arrested on January 12, 2019, and charged with defilement in a Molo court after it was discovered the minor who was his pupil was pregnant.

The trial court found him guilty on August 13, 2020, and sentenced him to 20 years behind bars.

Langat's appeal against the conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court on July 7, 2021, for lack of merit.

The accused filed a miscellaneous application two years later on October 25, 2023, seeking a rehearing of his sentencing. He argued that his age and the time already served in prison were sufficient punishment and highlighted his rehabilitation through theological classes and counseling services.

Langat also emphasised his remorse and claimed his family and community were willing to accept him back.

“I have changed my behaviour, and have an amicable relationship with my fellow inmates. I am remorseful and regret my actions having undertaken a complete transformation,” Langat stated.

However, the state opposed his application, arguing that the sentence was lawful and emphasised the severity of his crime. The prosecution pointed out that Langat, old enough to be the victim's grandfather, abused his position of authority to defile the minor leading to her pregnancy repeatedly.

“The aggravating circumstances of the case are that the victim was a 14-year-old child in primary school and was defiled several times by the applicant as a teacher in her school Tembo Primary. That further the victim was pregnant during the trial,” stated the prosecution counsel.

Justice Samuel Mohochi in his ruling upheld the original sentence stating that the aggravating circumstances warranted a deterrent sentence and found no basis to alter the original judgment.

“This court is persuaded of the correctness, legality, or propriety of the sentence imposed on August 13, 2020, and finds no basis to disturb the same,” ruled Justice Mohochi.","By

Trump is a convicted felon. Now what?,"May 30 (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the first former US president to be convicted of a crime, will remain a free man while he awaits sentencing and could avoid a prison term entirely for falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.

Here is a look at what’s next for the Republican candidate for president against Democratic President Joe Biden in a Nov. 5 election.

What happens now?

The judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, must first approve the verdict and enter a final judgment, though this is typically a formality.

Criminal defendants in New York are typically sentenced within several weeks of conviction, but post-verdict legal wrangling can sometimes lead to months of delays. In the meantime, lawyers and prosecutors will recommend sentences and then argue over them at Trump’s sentencing hearing, where Merchan will make a decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely.

The maximum sentence for Trump’s crime of falsifying business records is 1-1/3 to four years in prison.

It is rare for people with no criminal history who are convicted only of falsification of business records to be sentenced to prison in New York. Punishments like fines or probation are more common.

Defendants convicted of falsifying business records who get sentenced to time behind bars typically serve a year or less, and even in those cases most were convicted of other crimes such as fraud or grand larceny - unlike Trump

If punished beyond a fine, Trump could be placed under home confinement or subject to a curfew rather than imprisoned.

As a former president, he has a lifetime Secret Service detail, and the logistics of keeping him safe behind bars could be complicated.

Trump could also be released on bail while appealing his conviction.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes. Trump is likely to make arguments that Merchan rejected ahead of trial, including that the indictment is legally flawed and politically motivated.

He is also likely to argue Merchan deprived him of a fair trial by making legal errors, including allowing salacious testimony by a porn star who said she had sex with Trump - testimony his lawyers said was gratuitous and aimed at inflaming the jury against him.

The defence is likely to argue that the charges themselves were legally improper. Falsifying business records on its own is a misdemeanor in New York, but is elevated to a felony when done to help commit or conceal another crime. In this case, Bragg's office said that other crime was a conspiracy to violate a state election law.

But Trump's lawyers have argued that state law does not apply to federal elections.

Could Trump still be president?

Yes. The US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years.

In theory, Trump could be sworn in from jail or prison on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2025, if he were to unseat Biden.","By

How can Trump be president despite the conviction?

Neither a criminal conviction nor a prison sentence would affect Trump's eligibility or his ability to become president. In theory, he could be sworn in from jail or prison if he were to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.

Jailhouse presidential campaigns are not unprecedented in U.S. history. Socialist Eugene Debs unsuccessfully ran for president from prison in the 1920 election, though unlike Trump he was not a serious contender.

,"Every year, thousands of Kenyans seek greener pastures in the US. Some get lucky, others do not. For those who do, some start with menial jobs and rise to set up their thriving businesses.

Naomi Ogutu, 48, Kea Wakesho Simmons, 41, and Nancy Gakere, 50, are among Kenyans who have found success in the US, all in the travel industry.

Nancy has been living abroad for over 30 years.

“I came to the US in 1990 at the age of 17. I had just finished high school in Kenya so I came here to attend college,” she says.

She started off as an accountant, before turning her travelling hobby into a business.

“I started blogging in 2019. I used to share my travel adventures. As an accountant, travelling was my way to wind down and escape my hectic work environment,” she says.

She soon got a following from enthusiasts, who started asking if they could travel with her.

“I decided to curate group trips to places I had been to and offer them to my followers to allow them to have the same experience. This seemed to resonate with many of them who wanted to travel but didn’t know how to make it a reality,” she says.

Fancy Nancy Travels

Being a business that requires minimal capital—just cash to create the website and social media management—the travel curation enterprise picked up fast.

She named it Fancy Nancy Travels.

“All the clients need to do, is show up, and everything is taken care of; from the moment they arrive to the moment they leave,” says Nancy, who runs the company that operates out of Los Angeles, CA.

“This is a business that came about as a natural progression from my passion for travel. It’s a hobby turned into a business. My clients are mainly African women in the diaspora, with the majority based in the US. I connect with them mainly through social media,” she says.

Is being an entrepreneur in the US better than being in Kenya? I ask.

“I haven’t done much business in Kenya, so it’s hard to compare, but I can say that the business environment in the US is quite regulated and straightforward,” she says.

She usually takes clients to countries she has visited, which as of now, is 30 countries.

“In 2023, I took clients to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Indonesia (Bali). In 2024, the trips are to Greece, Cuba, the Maldives and Indonesia (Bali),” says Nancy.

As she grows her business, does she feel like she has achieved her dream?

“I feel like I am still on the path to achieving the American dream, but definitely on the right path,” says the entrepreneur, who urges people to focus on the passion and not the money.

“I honestly did not think about establishing the company, but things progressed naturally to where I needed to formalise it,” she says.

Taxi driver

Naomi Ogutu is another Kenyan living in the US who has found success in the travel industry.

She went to the US in 2012 and started by working as a taxi driver.

She had vowed that by the tenth year of her stay in the US, she would be an employer, and indeed, her dream had been fulfilled.

When she reached the US, it was not easy to settle.

“It took us one year to finally get our papers right, but we got our work permits in six months. No one hosted us. When I landed at JFK with my family, we booked a hotel, and after a week, we got an apartment (not easy - we were assigned by a non-profit organisation called CAMBA) which got us an apartment and connected us with Upwardly Global for New Americans. I guess the fact that no one hosted me, gave me the courage and confidence to use my independent thinking in navigating my life here in the US,” she says.

“I’m sure if I were hosted by anyone, they would have discouraged me from even living in New York City; that’s understandably very expensive. But through all my struggles, I’ve thrived,” she says.

Her first real job in 2013 was in retail, where she worked at a high-end retail chain on 5th Avenue and 53rd Street Manhattan for three months. Her second job is where she received training and placement at an agency that got her a job at a major electric company in New York.

“I was a systems administrator in their sub-surface construction department. My work entailed being a focal point of contact and coordination of the field crews, the engineering department and the HR department. My work was to update these three departments on work progress, troubleshooting and reporting lost hours due to emerging issues in the field and any work delays. My contract ended after three years and I moved on,” she says.

Ms Ogutu’s third job was at the New York University Treasury Department. “Here, I started as an administrative assistant and in a few months, my manager moved me to auditing. I lasted just one year in this job, and in 2016, I made a big blunder at work that almost got me fired, but I opted to resign before they could fire me,” she says.

Personal challenges

At that time, she was going through personal challenges which affected her work.

“I even contemplated suicide. I was saved by a truck driver as I sat by the Mississippi River (a sign read ‘This is the highest point of the Mississippi River’). I was contemplating jumping in. But that Good Samaritan or angel just held my hand, took me to a Wendy’s restaurant, bought me lunch and let me cry and tell him everything! A white man I didn’t even know. He gave me his number on a paper but I threw it away. I couldn’t face him after that incident,” she says.

Her business idea was born right by the banks of the Mississippi River.

“I went back to New York with my mind made up. It was my time. One day, an Uber driver named Famara from Senegal drove me home. We talked a lot and he told me, ‘Hey sister, Uber business is good. We make even a lot of money stress-free. No clocking into an office, no boss, no schedule—you create your own schedule.’ So he told me about the master Cabbie Academy and in 2017, I was already an Uber driver in New York City.”

After getting her New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission license and registration, she immediately started driving for Uber and Lyft in New York City’s five boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island.

She established her firm in 2018, but incorporated it in 2020 as an S-Corporation, Naomi Cars NYC, with offices on West 57th Street, in Midtown Manhattan, NYC.

“In 2018, I started marketing my sightseeing tours to my Uber clients. If we clicked with a client, I would offer them my business card and let them know I’m available to take them around and showcase the beauty and hidden gems of New York City. Now I have six tour guides, and I work with 19 drivers who are independent contractors,” she says.

Entrepreneurship was not a new game. Ms Ogutu had been in business in Kenya before moving to the US.

She ran a bookstore in Nairobi which supplied books to colleges and universities.

“I knew that in the US, hard work pays, and the business environment there was straightforward and rewarding. Kenya was okay, but I was constantly chasing after procurement officers to get paid. You are taken around circles, just to bribe. I got tired of the corruption and lack of ethics,” she says.

Has she achieved what she had hoped to? I ask.

Good life

“My journey abroad was propelled by the desire to give my children a good life. I’m a single mother of three children. My firstborn daughter, 23, works for the state of New Jersey. My son,19, is a freshman at SUNY Polytechnic Institute, studying Mechanical Engineering Technology, and is already on the Engineering Department Dean’s List. He’s on a full scholarship to a microchip manufacturing company that has also offered him a very prestigious paid summer internship. My other daughter, 17, is also headed to college with a full-ride scholarship. She’s been admitted to 20 universities, but she has zeroed in on two - RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), which offered her the scholarship, and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University to study aeronautical engineering. We are waiting to get her scholarship package, then she will decide where to go,” she says.

There are many job opportunities that have sprouted from travel. Kea Wakesho Simmons, another Kenyan travelled abroad for the first time to Korea when she was 23. She says that it was out of curiosity about the world and different cultures and histories.

Her travel business also started with a passion for new destinations.

“I worked in the US Army as a human resources specialist and served for five years, including deployments to Iraq and Korea. During my time in Korea, my passion for travel was ignited, fueling my desire to explore the world,” says Wakesho.

In 2011, she left the military and went to Afghanistan, as a civilian.

“I worked there for three and a half years. I was coordinating over 5,000 personnel and managing administrative procedures. I worked in Estonia, Bulgaria, and Iraq for seven and a half years. Living and working in these countries allowed me to visit 45 different countries and live in seven,” she says.

She wanted to share her extensive travel with the world, hence she co-founded a travel concierge firm World Views, with a capital of $10,000 (Sh1.32 million.)

“One of my notable achievements was leading a group of over 100 travellers to Kenya, where I introduced a fresh perspective on Afro-tourism in Africa. Recently, I expanded my efforts to Central America. In 2023, I relaunched my business under Traverze Culture, continuing to provide the same services,” she says

Traverze Culture is out of the US and has its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, with a team of 12 employees.

,"Every year, thousands of Kenyans seek greener pastures in the US. Some get lucky, others do not. For those who do, some start with menial jobs and rise to set up their thriving businesses.

Naomi Ogutu, 48, Kea Wakesho Simmons, 41, and Nancy Gakere, 50, are among Kenyans who have found success in the US, all in the travel industry.

Nancy has been living abroad for over 30 years.

“I came to the US in 1990 at the age of 17. I had just finished high school in Kenya so I came here to attend college,” she says.

She started off as an accountant, before turning her travelling hobby into a business.

“I started blogging in 2019. I used to share my travel adventures. As an accountant, travelling was my way to wind down and escape my hectic work environment,” she says.

She soon got a following from enthusiasts, who started asking if they could travel with her.

“I decided to curate group trips to places I had been to and offer them to my followers to allow them to have the same experience. This seemed to resonate with many of them who wanted to travel but didn’t know how to make it a reality,” she says.

Fancy Nancy Travels

Being a business that requires minimal capital—just cash to create the website and social media management—the travel curation enterprise picked up fast.

She named it Fancy Nancy Travels.

“All the clients need to do, is show up, and everything is taken care of; from the moment they arrive to the moment they leave,” says Nancy, who runs the company that operates out of Los Angeles, CA.

“This is a business that came about as a natural progression from my passion for travel. It’s a hobby turned into a business. My clients are mainly African women in the diaspora, with the majority based in the US. I connect with them mainly through social media,” she says.

Is being an entrepreneur in the US better than being in Kenya? I ask.

“I haven’t done much business in Kenya, so it’s hard to compare, but I can say that the business environment in the US is quite regulated and straightforward,” she says.

She usually takes clients to countries she has visited, which as of now, is 30 countries.

“In 2023, I took clients to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Indonesia (Bali). In 2024, the trips are to Greece, Cuba, the Maldives and Indonesia (Bali),” says Nancy.

As she grows her business, does she feel like she has achieved her dream?

“I feel like I am still on the path to achieving the American dream, but definitely on the right path,” says the entrepreneur, who urges people to focus on the passion and not the money.

“I honestly did not think about establishing the company, but things progressed naturally to where I needed to formalise it,” she says.

Taxi driver

Naomi Ogutu is another Kenyan living in the US who has found success in the travel industry.

She went to the US in 2012 and started by working as a taxi driver.

She had vowed that by the tenth year of her stay in the US, she would be an employer, and indeed, her dream had been fulfilled.

When she reached the US, it was not easy to settle.

Western Tourism Circuit’s low numbers worry stakeholders,"There is concern over declining tourism and under-utilisation of attraction sites in the Western region.

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has reported a low turnout of visitors to its facilities in the Western Tourism Circuit, despite the huge potential.

This has forced stakeholders in the sector to plan for a regional tourism expo in Kitale in August, through which they hope to jump-start the sector.

KWS Western Regional Director Bakari Chongwa said the region’s potential is still untapped.

Speaking to Nation.africa, Mr Chongwa observed the need for stakeholders to focus on innovative strategies to market the region.

He said Western region counties are home to fascinating tourist sites that if well packaged, can be a game changer in the tourism sector.

“We have very great attractions including the unique white elephants in Mt Elgon National Park, the rare Sitatunga antelopes at Saiwa Swamp National Park and Kakamega Forest’s unique birds,” noted Mr Chongwa.

He said key stakeholders in the sector like hoteliers and travel agencies have a huge role to play in the marketing region.

Trans Nzoia Tourism Association chairperson Naomi Karani noted that the August expo will be a platform to identify the region's potential and challenges that have caused a disconnect between players in the sector.

Ms Karani said part of the concern is the declining investment in the sector.

She revealed that the stakeholders are working with the Lake Region Counties Tourism Association and Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) to identify key exhibitors who will showcase and package tourism for marketing.

KNCCI Trans Nzoia County chairman Titus Killong’ said the expo will be a milestone to improve the region’s tourism sector both locally and internationally.

“We want to use the expo to also package Trans-Nzoia as an agricultural hub. This is part of our strategy to maximise specific attractions in our region,” he added.

Vihiga woman stranded and ill in Saudi Arabia after dream job turns sour,"When Knight Ajenya left her home in Vihiga County in October 2023 for Saudi Arabia, she was in high spirits and full of expectations.

She was hoping to transform her family's fortunes and send her three children to good schools.

The 33-year-old Ajenya learnt about the job opportunity in Saudi Arabia from Mary Musembe, a neighbour who had returned to the village from Nairobi for a holiday in April last year.

Read: Dorothy Kweyu: A Sh123m demand and a mother’s cry to save her son from Saudi executioner in 10 days

Musembe would later introduce Ajenya to an agent in Nairobi, who was identified only as Ruth.

Ajenya and several other young women who shared the same aspirations would later be taken to Limuru by the said agent for a six-month training before heading out to their prospective employers in the Gulf.

Embarked on her journey

Ajenya's father, Nerbert Otiende, recalled how his daughter approached him for his final blessings before she embarked on her journey to the land of greener pastures.

“Having been a hawker on the streets of Kisumu for over 20 years, I saw my daughter’s proposal as a potential game changer. Life was so difficult for all of us, more so, after her marriage failed. It was such a daunting task taking care of the kids with my meagre earnings,” Mr Otiende explained.

Ajenya could call her father nearly every day during her first few weeks in Saudi Arabia and update him about the goings on.

“She would tell me about her life, how warm she was received by her employer's family and how friendly the family was,” Mr Otiende recalled.

However, after two months Ajenya’s dreams of making it hit headwinds. Suddenly, the frequent phone calls to her father disappeared. Mr Otiende was worried. He would later learn that his daughter had quit her job and went to live in a holding camp for unclear reasons.

""I tried to seek her explanation for what transpired in vain. Our communication had deteriorated so much since she no longer had a phone and was relying on well-wishers to talk to us,"" narrated Mr Otiende.

Ajenya would later stay in the camp for a few days while job hunting. It was during that period that she fell seriously ill, attracting the attention of a fellow Kenyan woman who was also putting up at the camp.

According to her father, her health condition worsened since she could not get immediate medical attention due to insufficient funds.

Nearby hospital

“Her friend took her to a nearby hospital where she was only given some paracetamol,” Mr Otiende said.

He says his daughter only survives on fluids because the infection in her throat cannot allow her to eat solid foods.

""Up to this moment we still don't know what she is ailing from since no medical examination has been conducted to determine the exact illness,"" said Mr Otiende.

The 58-year-old man said that he had tried several times to reach out to the agent responsible for his daughter’s placement, but she declined to help get his daughter back home.

“Whenever I call her all she says is that she cannot assist me since she is yet to benefit from my daughter’s job in the Gulf,” he recounted.

Ajenya is now under the care of a Kenyan friend who identified herself to Mr Otiende as Kagai.

“It is through this Kagai that we are able to receive updates about my child. She has been the one taking her to the hospital whenever her condition worsens. As a family we can’t even afford to raise money for her air ticket back home,"" he said.

Homa Bay man in court over theft of UDA election gadget,"A man has been charged in a Homa Bay court with assaulting a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) clerk and robbing him of an electronic gadget used by the party to conduct grassroots elections.

Mr Robert Ongaro was accused of using force to dispossess the clerk, identified as Godwin Okello, of the gadget during the first phase of the UDA's grassroots elections.

The court heard that the accused was part of a group of people who stormed a polling station last month and assaulted UDA election officials before stealing from the clerk.

Ongaro faced two charges, including robbery with violence.

Robbery with violence convicts face the death penalty.

On the first count, the court was told that on April 26, when the UDA was conducting its primary elections, Ongaro, together with others not present in court, robbed Mr Okello by force.

The court heard that they contravened Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code.

Stole (a) gadget

""You are charged that on April 26, 2024, at 2:30pm at Ongeti Primary School in Omoya in Kagan jointly with others not before court while armed with sticks you robbed from Godwin Okello of UDA and stole (a) gadget serial number 202404035 labelled Homa Bay/Rangwe/ Kochia/ Ongeti Primary School property of UDA and a mobile phone, property of Gordon Okello and used violence against the said person,"" read the charge sheet.

The suspect was also charged with creating a disturbance and acting in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace contrary to Section 95 (1) (b) of the Penal Code.

The charge sheet also accused Ongaro of assaulting the UDA returning officer.

He denied both charges when he appeared before Homa Bay Chief Magistrate Joy Wesonga.

The prosecution has called five witnesses in the case.

The case will be mentioned on June 11, 2024, while a hearing has been set for June 19, 2024.

Mr Robert Ongaro was accused of using force to dispossess the clerk, identified as Godwin Okello, of the gadget during the first phase of the UDA's grassroots elections.

The court heard that the accused was part of a group of people who stormed a polling station last month and assaulted UDA election officials before stealing from the clerk.

Ongaro faced two charges, including robbery with violence.

Robbery with violence convicts face the death penalty.

On the first count, the court was told that on April 26, when the UDA was conducting its primary elections, Ongaro, together with others not present in court, robbed Mr Okello by force.

The court heard that they contravened Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code.

Stole (a) gadget

""You are charged that on April 26, 2024, at 2:30pm at Ongeti Primary School in Omoya in Kagan jointly with others not before court while armed with sticks you robbed from Godwin Okello of UDA and stole (a) gadget serial number 202404035 labelled Homa Bay/Rangwe/ Kochia/ Ongeti Primary School property of UDA and a mobile phone, property of Gordon Okello and used violence against the said person,"" read the charge sheet.

The suspect was also charged with creating a disturbance and acting in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace contrary to Section 95 (1) (b) of the Penal Code.

The charge sheet also accused Ongaro of assaulting the UDA returning officer.

He denied both charges when he appeared before Homa Bay Chief Magistrate Joy Wesonga.

The prosecution has called five witnesses in the case.

The case will be mentioned on June 11, 2024, while a hearing has been set for June 19, 2024.

,"On the night of September 10, 2018, Police Constable Yunus Ali Athman received a phone call from his superiors, which left him in a court battle to prove his innocence six years later.

The phone call reported a criminal gang in Likoni, allegedly terrorising locals and stealing items, including livestock.

Athman told a Mombasa court that he was at his home in Mtongwe when he received a call from his superiors at the Mtongwe Police Station.

""I was instructed to go to the location where the criminals were hiding. An informant was supposed to contact me and lead me to their hideout,"" he recalled.

Since the informant delayed contacting him, he decided to go directly to the station to inquire about the assignment. He had been assigned to be part of the special team dealing with criminal gangs in Likoni.

""While on my way to the station, I received another call informing me that the OCS had arranged for someone to guide me to the criminals,"" he told the court.

Athman then met with the informant, Mr Mohamed Kassim Karega, and they took a motorbike to Mwanza village in Likoni, where the alleged criminals were hiding.

The motorbike rider was Mr Albert Wekesa.

Upon reaching the hideout of the criminals, they did not find the gang as expected.

Mbaraka Maitha Omar

They then proceeded to a house owned by Mbaraka Maitha Omar. The information provided to Mr Athman suggested that Omar was part of the gang wielding machetes, responsible for stealing cattle in the area.

""I looked inside and saw no one. The door was partially open. Soon after, Omar appeared and brandished a machete,"" he said.

At that moment, the officer reportedly fired at Omar, shooting him twice and leaving him injured.

Subsequently, Mr Athman and Mr Karega were arrested and charged with Omar's murder. While the charge against Mr Karega was dropped, the state proceeded with prosecuting Mr Athman for the incident.

On Wednesday, before the court, Mr Athman regretted responding to the phone call and proceeding to the assignment.

""I wish I had known there was a machete there; I would not have gone,"" he told High Court Judge Anne Ong'injo.

The officer admitted before the judge that he was involved in the fatal shooting of Omar while searching for criminal gangs in Likoni.

However, Mr Athman informed the court he was defending himself from the threat of an imminent attack, as he was confronted by a machete-wielding suspect.

Mr Athman informed Justice Ong’injo that he shot Omar twice, in the arm and head, in self-defence.

Stepped back

""Omar attempted to attack me with a machete, but I stepped back and shot him in the hand. I continued shooting, and the bullet hit him in the head. I was at risk of being killed. My gun only had six bullets,"" Mr Athman stated.

Following the shooting, the suspect claimed that other criminals, supposedly the deceased's accomplices, arrived, forcing him to escape to a nearby thicket to hide.

He claimed that if he had not used his gun to defend himself when Omar attacked him, he would be dead.

However, Mr Athman denied any involvement in planning the murder.

""It was a moment of panic, I had never faced such a situation before. I shot him to make an arrest. I wanted him to drop the machete so I could apprehend him, that was my intention. My life and that of the two others who were with me were in jeopardy,"" he explained.

Through his lawyer Eugene Wangila, Mr Athman stated that he was not acquainted with the deceased before the incident and was led to  Omar's residence by an informant.

The officer informed the court that the deceased tried to attack Karega and Wekesa upon their entry into his house during the search.

""Kassim and Wekesa retreated and fled, but I remained still. He intended to harm me as I was in close proximity,"" he explained during questioning by state prosecutor Bernard Ngiri.

Athman has denied killing Omar.

He was initially charged alongside Mr Karega, who later became a state witness.

On a motorcycle

The court was informed that on the day of the incident, Mr Athman went to Omar's residence to make an arrest.  He was accompanied by Mr Karega on a motorcycle driven by Mr Wekesa.

Upon arrival at the mentioned residence, Mr Athman allegedly shot and killed Omar.

Mr Wekesa, a crucial witness in the murder trial against Mr Athman, also died under mysterious circumstances. His body was found in the Dongo Kundu area in Kwale.

The court ruled that Athman had a case to answer.

In his defence, Athman stated that the incident was quite peculiar as he did not intend to spill any blood but to make a lawful arrest.

According to the suspect, the deceased refused to greet him when he entered his house but instead started shouting at Mr Karega and threatening him.

The suspect mentioned that it was at this moment that the deceased brandished a machete, leading to a confrontation that resulted in the gunshots.

“I shot him, and he fell. I informed my boss who had tasked me with searching for and arresting the criminal gang,” he said.

Athman noted that cattle were stolen in the area, and the machete-wielding gang had been threatening the locals.

The suspect has requested time to present his final defence to prove his innocence before the court delivers its judgment.

"Man, girlfriend in custody after woman dies in suspected love triangle in Kisumu","A Kisumu court has granted police permission to remand for 14 days two suspects accused of killing a 22-year-old woman on Monday.

The detention will allow detectives at Kondele Police Station to complete investigations into the death of Vince Juma, who was allegedly pushed to her death from the second floor of a rented flat in Lolwe Estate, Kisumu.

The ruling followed a miscellaneous criminal application filed by Naboth Otieno Ondoro, an investigator attached to DCI Kondele Police Station.

He listed the two suspects, Cecil Wilson Omondi and Ashley Jemima Atieno, as first and second respondents respectively.

According to the officer, the two suspects, who are lovers, were arrested on May 28, 2024, after police discovered that they could be involved in the murder of Vince, which happened around 10pm on the material day.

""If the accused are detained at Kondele Police Station, they will assist us in establishing the cause of death of Vince Juma. The lives of the accused are also at risk and if they are released immediately, they could be harmed as members of the public are still agitated by their (alleged) actions,"" said Mr Ondoro.

Jeopardise the investigation

The officer also argued that the suspects posed a flight risk and that releasing them on bail would jeopardise the investigation.

Also read: Jilted lover to serve 30 years in jail for splashing acid in woman’s eyes

A post-mortem examination to determine the true cause of Vince's death is yet to be conducted and therefore investigators want more time to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident.

The case came before Winam Court Senior Principal Magistrate Robert Oanda, who ruled in favour of the detective.

""Upon reading the notice of motion application and hearing the applicant, I hereby order that the respondents be remanded at Kondele Police Station for a period of 14 days to allow DCI conclude investigations,"" said Mr Oanda.

Before her death, Vince allegedly confronted Mr Omondi, who is said to be her ex-boyfriend, at a local mini-mart.

According to a neighbour, Mr Omondi, 30, had gone to buy an ice cream when he met Vince, who also lives in the same area.

She insisted on accompanying Mr Omondi to his house, but he refused.

On reaching the entrance to his rented flat, Mr Omondi quickly locked the gate from the inside before the deceased could enter.

According to Mr Ojwang, Mr Omondi was in the house with his 20-year-old new girlfriend Ashley - a student at Riat Institute of Advanced Technology.

Her body was later taken to the hospital's mortuary.

The return of Diani's nightlife,"For more than five years, residents and tourists in Diani, Kwale County, have been at risk of attacks due to rising cases of insecurity.

This situation was fueled by a lack of street lights along Diani Beach Road, the town's busiest road.

Diani, a resort town, has been attracting revellers from across the globe, who enjoy the world-class beaches during the day and party at popular joints in the area at night.

In 2023, Diani Beach was named “Africa’s Leading Beach Destination” for the 11th successive time by the World Travel Awards (WTA), stamping its bragging rights as a favourite global tourism destination.

Away from the pristine beaches, popular hangout joints include Full Moon Club, Manyatta Disco, Palmer Club and Tandoori International Club, all situated along Beach Road.

However, criminal gangs engaging in muggings along the streets threatened the town’s glory.

So bad was the situation that residents would start deserting streets when darkness fell, affecting businesses.

Tourists in the 24-hour economy would frequently report attacks and mugging along the road, losing their valuables as they walked.

A spot check by Nation.Africa revealed night activities have resumed after the new streetlights were installed by the Kwale County Government.

Entertainment industry

Tourism stakeholders and those in the entertainment industry have equally lauded the installation of street lights since March this year, saying they are banking on them to boost their businesses further.

Stephen Mure, an entertainment manager at Sisi Kwa Sisi Entertainment Movement, said they now have confidence in organising night events.

He said most of the time, weekday and weekend parties feature invitations from top artists and DJs.

""Our numbers were being affected due to insecurity because many people would not want to show up and leave late after the parties,"" said Mr Mure.

He added that even though the area is now in a low business season, sales and activities will rise further towards the end of July when the peak tourism season begins.

He further urged the county government to ensure all the stretch between Jacaranda Beach Hotel and Neptune Beach Hotel has enough security lights.

Shaban Omar, a resident of Diani, said he is now confident of moving at night without fear of being attacked.

""I can comfortably run my errands or do my shopping at night because there is enough light,"" he said.

Police patrols

Msambweni OCPD Francis Gachoki said the lights also helped police patrol the area.

He, however, said there have not been any reported cases after the street lights.

""We would receive many cases of people being mugged on the road. Due to the dark and forested area, many gangs would hide in the area targeting tourists at night,"" he said.

An earlier solar street lighting project, installed in 2013, was vandalised as thieves stole the panels, solar chargers and bulbs, leaving streets empty and dark.

This limited tourists' movement at night, especially those accessing cottages from entertainment joints. The road also hosts most beach resorts and boutique hotels.

According to the Kwale County CEC for Trade and Tourism Michael Mutua, the move to light the streets was to improve the tourism business, which had been affected by insecurity.

""Normally, tourists want to take a night walk after having dinner. Most of them are also getting attracted to Diani because of the vibrant nightlife,"" he said.

Mutua said the administration would ensure the new solar lights are not vandalised.

""We have so far done 50 poles for about two kilometres which was a hotspot for crime. The design was different because the battery, the solar and the bulb are now fixed together and can hardly be vandalised,"" Mutua said.

He added that the rest of the road will be lit with about 161 poles in phases in the coming financial year on a budget of Sh28 million.

Mutua added that apart from the main road, his department would pave beach access roads with cabro and amenities such as public washrooms.

""We have spoken to some property owners to ensure they also take responsibility and help reduce vandalism of public resources such as street lights,"" said Mutua.

While launching the lights in March, Kwale Governor Fatuma Achani stated that the solar lights will also be a game changer in the transport sector, where bodaboda and tuk-tuks will work round the clock.

,"Every year, Kenyan pilgrims from various corners of the country sacrifice their time, energy and resources to undertake an arduous spiritual journey to Namugongo Shrine in Uganda.

The shrine is where Charles Lwanga, a Ugandan martyr and his companions, who stood firm for their faith - were burned alive following a decree from King Mwanga II of the Buganda Kingdom.

Every year, thousands of Kenyans trek several kilometres to the shrine in Namugongo to mark Uganda Martyrs Day, held on June 3.

Some 500,000 Catholics from Uganda and the rest of Africa troop to the shrine to offer prayers and thanksgiving yearly.

Some pilgrims commence their journey to Namugongo as early as May 1, especially those coming from far-flung regions of the coast of Kenya.

This year, faithful from Malindi, led by Reverend Father Patrick Mudunga, kicked off their journey nearly a month ago.

They will be joined by Catholics from Nyahururu, Kakamega, Bungoma, Kisumu and Busia dioceses as they plan to make it to Namugongo by June 1.

Fr Mudunga says that the pilgrimage is a significant moment for Catholics since it opens doors for blessings.

“This is the time that Christians set aside their time to focus on prayers. It is a spiritual exercise, where they put aside luxury in memory of the Uganda Martyrs,” he said.

Former Assistant Director at the Vincentian Retreat Centre of Entebbe, Fr Michael Louis, notes that the pilgrimage offers the faithful a chance to commemorate the Uganda Martyrs journey in faith.

The walk is relevant in Uganda, given that the first missionaries, Fr Simeon Marpel, alias Maperra, and Brother Amansi, walked preaching the gospel to the locals in Uganda.

Refused to denounce their faith

Charles Lwanga and his companions were among the first converts to the Christian faith in Uganda. They were killed because they refused to denounce their faith.

The first 45 martyrs hailed from a place known as Munyonyo. They were frogmarched to the execution ground in Namugongo.

A total of 22 Roman Catholics and 23 Anglicans died in different places along the way between 1885 and 1887.

“They were first baptised in a shrine in Munyonyo. Next to the shrine is where St Dennis Ssebuggwawo was killed,” said Fr Louis.

Namugongo is the National Shrine of Uganda.

The faithful make prayers nine days before the feast day, marked on June 3.

Before they set off, pilgrims usually notify officials of the churches where they would make stopovers of their camping plans.

While some prefer walking during the day and resting at night, others opt to trek at night and rest during the day.

The faithful usually walk in a formation where a leader carrying a crucifix opens the way, followed by members, and those with the church’s and the country’s flags bring the rear.

Josephine Apondi, a faithful residing in Kisumu, has been undertaking the pilgrimage since 2014.

She says that faithful starting their journey from Kisumu make nine stopovers in parishes before reaching Namugongo.

They would spend a night in Yala and Ugunja in Siaya County before proceeding to Busia for their third night.

While in Uganda, they will make another six stopovers before they arrive at Namugongo.

Arrive at the shrine

“We usually start on May 22 and by June 1 we arrive at the shrine,” she explains.

On May 30, there’s usually a Holy Mass celebrated at Mabira Forest to celebrate the lives of five Kenyan pilgrims killed by speeding taxis on May 31, 1998, and May 26, 2019.

Kenyan pilgrims have made it a tradition to pray for the souls of their departed colleagues.

“On that day thousands gather in the forest early in the morning to celebrate the life of John Kibe and his companions who were killed in an accident,” says Ms Apondi.

The pilgrims arrive at Namugongo on June 1 and rest for a day as they wait for the celebration of the feast on June 3.

Martyrs Day is considered a public event in Uganda.

From Fr Louis’s experience, while taking a walk from Entebbe to Namugongo in 2023, he said he felt the power of martyrdom.

“We were six individuals. We started our journey at 3pm, walked throughout the night till 3am when we finally arrived at Namugongo,” he recalls.

“In the walk, there are many healings taking place because of the prayers that are offered during the journey. There was a particular lady who had health issues and walked from Kasese to Namugongo and got healed.”

Fr Louis says that many faithful have attested to experience a sense of peace and holiness whenever they tour the shrine to offer prayers.

Forgiveness and salvation

“Often we use our legs to go to a place to commit sin. So when we walk for a good course once in a year it will definitely bring grace, forgiveness and salvation to our lives,” said Fr Louis.

Henry Onyango, a Kisumu resident, says he experienced a breakthrough after going to the Namugongo Shrine to pray for his brother, who had a crisis at work.

“I had quite an interesting experience last year in June. I went to the shrine with a prayer request for my brother who had issues at his workplace with his bosses. When I got back to Kisumu, he told me the issue had been sorted out and he got a promotion at his workplace,” says Mr Onyango.

Vincent Owuor Otieno, another faithful from Kisumu, says he has visited the shrine six times. Four times before Covid-19 and twice after the pandemic.

He first went in 2011 with a group of friends while in college. Otieno draws inspiration from the youngest martyr, St Kizito, who was courageous enough to die for his faith.

“How thousands come to the place tells a lot about the powerful intercession of the Uganda Martyrs. Every year I have made it a tradition to go to the shrine and it has cemented my faith and spirituality,” said Mr Otieno.

After the three days of prayer and supplication, the faithful are free to leave the shrine for their home countries, only that this time around, they can ride on vehicles.

Haiti transition council taps former PM Garry Conille to lead the country,"Haiti's transition council on Tuesday tapped former Prime Minister Garry Conille, who briefly led the country over a decade ago, to return to the role as the Caribbean nation works to restore stability and take back control from violent gangs.

The transition council voted 6-1 to install Conille as interim prime minister, a member told Reuters.

Conille's extensive resume in development, working largely with the United Nations, is considered key to shoring up international support as Haiti prepares to launch a UN-backed security mission led by Kenya, though its deployment has faced hurdles.

The transition council, which holds some presidential powers, and its head, Edgard Leblanc, acting as a de-facto president, are now tasked with holding elections before February 7, 2026, as laid out in Haiti's constitution.

""Following discussions within the transition council after hearings with the candidates for prime minister, Dr. Garry Conille was chosen by consensus to lead the government during this transition period,"" Leblanc said on X.

Conille's naming underscores progress in Haiti's political process and follows Prime Minister Ariel Henry's resignation in March after he left Haiti to seek support for the Kenyan security mission and was unable to re-enter the country.

President Jovenel Moise, who named Henry, was assassinated in 2021. Haiti has not had a president since.

""My sincerest congratulations,"" business leader Alix Didier Fils-Aime, who had also put his hat in the ring for the role, said on X. ""I'm still a patriot who believes in this country. Long live Haiti!""

Conille was prime minister for just seven months, resigning in February 2012 after losing the support of his cabinet and clashing with then-President Michel Martelly.

Conille and Martelly butted heads over reconstruction contracts following a deadly 2010 earthquake and a parliamentary investigation into politicians holding dual citizenship, which is illegal in Haiti.

Conille most recently held the post of regional director at U.N. children's agency Unicef.

He will now be tasked with fighting off rampant insecurity as gangs have expanded their reach.

How caretaker’s bid to take over his German employer’s building failed,"A man who had attempted to short-change his employer by claiming ownership of his property has suffered a setback after the Court of Appeal okayed his eviction from a building he was occupying illegally in Malindi.

Mr Amin Mohamed Hamid, whom Mr Werner Sebastian had hired to look after his house, had tried to prevent the German national from evicting him by claiming that he had a share in the property and would incur significant losses if kicked out.

He requested the court to issue stay orders to protect his interests while awaiting the outcome of an appeal he plans to file against his eviction. However, the Court of Appeal rejected this request, stating that Mr Hamid did not adequately justify his application.

Justices Agnes Murgor, George Odunga, and Kibaya Laibuta said they were not convinced Mr Hamid’s planned appeal would become meaningless if the stay orders were not issued.

“Insofar as the applicant’s case is anchored on the claim that he expended substantial sums of money to undertake improvements on the property, any sums, if found due, would be recoverable,” said the judges.

Malindi Estates Limited

The case goes back to 2005 when Mr Sebastian bought the property from Malindi Estates Limited and registered it in his name. The foreigner then built a two-bedroomed house on the ground floor where he lived and two additional houses — two-bedroomed and one-bedroomed units — on the first floor.

He then travelled back to his home country, leaving Mr Hamid to look after the property.

The court record shows that sometime in 2013, Mr Hamid cautioned Mr Sebastian to never return to Kenya due to an alleged warrant of arrest which had been issued against him.

“When I returned to Kenya in 2015, I found that Mr Hamid had rented out the property to third parties,” he told the court.

The German then moved to court to ask for various orders including that Mr Hamid and his tenants vacate the premises and a permanent injunction be issued to block them from entering or interfering with his property.

He also asked for an annulment of an agreement that Mr Hamid had entered into alongside other orders for payment of damages.

Mr Hamid denied Mr Sebastian’s claim but admitted that the foreigner was the owner of the property and that he built the ground floor of the house.

But, according to Mr Hamid, he is the one who completed the first floor after Mr Sebastian had given it to him as a gift.

The defendant further filed a counterclaim, asking the court to issue an injunction preventing Mr Sebastian and his agents from accessing, occupying or in any manner interfering with his enjoyment of the property.

Refund any amounts owed

“The foreigner, his agents or assigns be compelled to unconditionally restore my water pipes and make good any other loss that he illegally caused to be occasioned or removed from the two houses built on the first floor of the building,” he said. Mr Hamid asked the court to recognise an agreement relating to the two houses constructed on the first floor of the building and dated October 15, 2013, as a valid and legally enforceable contract.

Environment and Land Court judge Millicent Odeny had initially ruled in favour of Mr Sebastian in a judgment issued in November 2023. Mr Hamid is, however, aggrieved with this decision and wants the Court of Appeal to overturn it.

In his appeal, Mr Hamid has faulted Justice Odeny, arguing that she erred in law and fact by considering matters that she ought not to have considered and overlooking the material he had placed before her.

In their decision to reject a request for stay orders by the appellant, the Court of Appeal judges also took into account Mr Sebastian’s offer to refund any amounts owed to Mr Hamid.

Additionally, they noted that the foreigner’s ownership of the property is undisputed and Mr Hamid’s occupation stems from his role as a caretaker.

“Mr Hamid’s claim that he invested Sh300,000 in the alleged development of the first floor would, if found to be due, be recoverable in a claim for special damages. Indeed, it would not be difficult to recover such sums in the event that its appeal succeeded,” said the judges.

Humanitarian crisis: Samburu families displaced by banditry struggle for survival,"Agnes Leshikuya's face bears a dry smile, betraying the anguish she has undergone in the last three months.

Jostling for space in a makeshift shelter during the heavy afternoon rain, she finds room for some of her children while others brave the downpour.

""This is not our wish. We have been pushed to the walls by these criminals, bandits and cattle rustlers,"" Leshikuya says, her voice breaking.

She then wraps her one-year-old child in a Maasai shuka, grateful to be alive after an escape from Soit Pus village in Samburu County three months ago.

""Bullets ricocheted daily. Let me say they (bullets) were just raining. I was very lucky to escape alive together with my children,"" she recounts of the bandit attack that forced her out of her home, where she lost hundreds of livestock.

Approaching the Nkabaai area, the crowd appears like a marketplace, but closer inspection reveals internally displaced families totalling close to 300 constructing makeshift shelters.

The people were forced to flee from their villages and are now seeking safety at the Nkabaai Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp after bandits ransacked and burnt adjacent villages.

But even here, the likes of Leshikuya lament abandonment by the government.

“We eat but not every day and we are not even sure of where it will come from. But we eat,"" she says.

Endemic poverty and heavy rains compound the insecurity for these vulnerable people, and road-daylight attacks have become routine despite intensified security operations by police backed by the military.

Now, a humanitarian crisis looms as more people flee bandit hotspots, with hundreds of learners out of school after closures due to banditry. Four schools remain shut despite learners in other counties continuing with learning.

Locals told Nation.Africa the government should resettle them and provide them with relief food and other material interventions.

""We are law abiding citizens. We have already been displaced, and also others have just been told to vacate. Please, let the government resettle us,"" said James Lenaseyian.

Samburu County Commissioner John Cheruiyot insists on relative calm and government efforts to eliminate banditry.

The administrator said the government had already deployed enough security personnel, including the National Police Reservists (NPRs), to patrol and beef up security in the area.

""There are no alarming cases, and therefore there is no need to fear. We have our security officers patrolling the areas. I urge parents to take children to school without fear,"" Cheruiyot said.

Samburu Woman Representative Pauline Lenguris said that the insecurity in the region had reduced hardworking pastoralists to unimaginable poverty levels.

Lenguris said that the locals live in unsanitary conditions and urgently need food and non-food items.

""These are hardworking Kenyans confined here unwillingly. They have been pushed to unimaginable poverty levels because their animals were recently driven away by armed bandits,"" said Lenguris, adding that the activities of banditry have disrupted farming, pastoralism, the main occupation of the people in Samburu West parts of Samburu North.

President William Ruto recently ordered the deployment of military officers to rehabilitate classes destroyed by bandits, assuring parents of security for all learners and institutions in the troubled North Rift region.

The government is preparing an aggressive aerial operation to combat armed bandits in Kenya's North Rift region counties of Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Turkana, West Pokot and Laikipia.

For the first time, police will utilize sophisticated gunship helicopters to enhance their capacity against banditry and complex crimes.

Three weeks ago, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki announced that these helicopters, equipped with advanced surveillance and firepower, aim to give security forces an edge over bandits who exploit the rough terrains for attacks and evasion.

""The decision to acquire gunship helicopters stems from the need to bolster security forces' capabilities in dealing with highly organised and heavily armed bandit groups,"" said CS Kindiki. The helicopters are expected to be particularly effective in Malaso in Samburu and Mkogodo Forest in Baringo.

He spoke at the Mombasa Port after flagging off the second batch of 10 Armoured Personnel Carriers for the police service.

Humanitarian crisis: Samburu families displaced by banditry struggle for survival,"Agnes Leshikuya's face bears a dry smile, betraying the anguish she has undergone in the last three months.

Jostling for space in a makeshift shelter during the heavy afternoon rain, she finds room for some of her children while others brave the downpour.

""This is not our wish. We have been pushed to the walls by these criminals, bandits and cattle rustlers,"" Leshikuya says, her voice breaking.

She then wraps her one-year-old child in a Maasai shuka, grateful to be alive after an escape from Soit Pus village in Samburu County three months ago.

""Bullets ricocheted daily. Let me say they (bullets) were just raining. I was very lucky to escape alive together with my children,"" she recounts of the bandit attack that forced her out of her home, where she lost hundreds of livestock.

Approaching the Nkabaai area, the crowd appears like a marketplace, but closer inspection reveals internally displaced families totalling close to 300 constructing makeshift shelters.

The people were forced to flee from their villages and are now seeking safety at the Nkabaai Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp after bandits ransacked and burnt adjacent villages.

But even here, the likes of Leshikuya lament abandonment by the government.

“We eat but not every day and we are not even sure of where it will come from. But we eat,"" she says.

Endemic poverty and heavy rains compound the insecurity for these vulnerable people, and road-daylight attacks have become routine despite intensified security operations by police backed by the military.

Now, a humanitarian crisis looms as more people flee bandit hotspots, with hundreds of learners out of school after closures due to banditry. Four schools remain shut despite learners in other counties continuing with learning.

Locals told Nation.Africa the government should resettle them and provide them with relief food and other material interventions.

""We are law abiding citizens. We have already been displaced, and also others have just been told to vacate. Please, let the government resettle us,"" said James Lenaseyian.

Samburu County Commissioner John Cheruiyot insists on relative calm and government efforts to eliminate banditry.

The administrator said the government had already deployed enough security personnel, including the National Police Reservists (NPRs), to patrol and beef up security in the area.

""There are no alarming cases, and therefore there is no need to fear. We have our security officers patrolling the areas. I urge parents to take children to school without fear,"" Cheruiyot said.

Samburu Woman Representative Pauline Lenguris said that the insecurity in the region had reduced hardworking pastoralists to unimaginable poverty levels.

Lenguris said that the locals live in unsanitary conditions and urgently need food and non-food items.

""These are hardworking Kenyans confined here unwillingly. They have been pushed to unimaginable poverty levels because their animals were recently driven away by armed bandits,"" said Lenguris, adding that the activities of banditry have disrupted farming, pastoralism, the main occupation of the people in Samburu West parts of Samburu North.

President William Ruto recently ordered the deployment of military officers to rehabilitate classes destroyed by bandits, assuring parents of security for all learners and institutions in the troubled North Rift region.

"High Court in Embu suspends muguka ban in Mombasa, Kilifi counties","The Mombasa and Kilifi governors were dealt a big blow after the Embu High Court stopped them from implementing their executive orders which banned the sale and transportation of Muguka in their regions. The case was heard on Tuesday, May 28.

The move followed the application by Kutherema Muguka Sacco and Embu County Assembly which sought conservatory orders to bar the two governors from enforcing the ban imposed on Muguka trade.

Justice Lucy Njuguna issued the conservatory orders, restraining the respondents or their agents from interfering with the Muguka trade at the coast.

She said the Court was satisfied that the application should be treated with the urgency it deserved.

She ruled that the executive orders issued on May, 22 should be shelved until July 8 when the suit will be heard interpartes.

The Judge directed that the governors be served with conservatory order papers within seven days.

Following the directive Muguka farmers celebrated, saying justice had been done.

""We welcome the conservatory orders, it is a win on our side,"" one of the farmers said at Muraru Muguka Market in Mbeere South.

Earlier the farmers had lamented that the move had messed up their business and vowed to fight until the Mombasa Governor Abduliswamad Sharif Nassir and his Kilifi counterpart revoked the ban.

Meanwhile, Governors from Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta have agreed to take part in talks led by the Agriculture Ministry on the trade of muguka.

This was after a phone call with President William Ruto, State House said.

“President William Ruto on Tuesday had a phone conversation with Governors of Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta counties on their concerns in the sale of muguka. The three Governors agreed to participate in a meeting of stakeholders to be convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock this week,” said a statement posted on the President’s social media platforms.

The call was a follow-up to a session on Monday between President Ruto and the leadership of Embu County led by the Governor.

“We agreed subsequently to convene a meeting of political leaders of the affected Counties next week,” explained the President.

Police hunt for suspects who murdered Mbita boda boda rider and raped his wife,"Police in Mbita, Homa Bay County, are hunting suspects linked to the murder of a boda boda rider whose wife was also raped during the attack.

The criminals are said to have abandoned a motorcycle they stole from the rider before going into hiding.

The incident happened at Got Rateng B village in the Nyamaji East sub-location at 4am on Tuesday.

According to Lambwe East Sub-location Chief Bernard Onditi, the criminals raided the rider's house where they carried out the attack.

He said the gang wanted to steal money from the rider that well-wishers had donated to help him buy a new motorcycle after an earlier robbery.

""One of his motorcycles was stolen by unknown persons and he was left with the old one,"" Mr Onditi said. His colleagues heard about his misfortune and decided to help him buy a new one.

""He did not buy another motorcycle immediately but decided to repair the old one. It seems the criminals were after the money,"" the chief said. Mr Onditi said the rider was sleeping with his wife when the gang stormed their house.

The horseman was hacked while his wife was raped. Mr Onditi said the woman had recently given birth and was still recovering.

Died while receiving treatment

""She had a five-day-old baby,"" the administrator said.

The boda boda rider died while receiving treatment at the Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital.

His wife was also taken to the hospital for treatment. Mr Onditi said a resident found the stolen motorcycle abandoned in a thicket.

The resident also recovered a mobile phone belonging to the deceased. Mbita sub-county police commander Solomon Barng'etuny confirmed the incident and said a team of officers had been deployed to investigate.

Homa Bay Town boda boda chairman Richard Opiyo said they had lost five motorcycles to criminals in the past month.

""Our only hope is in the hands of the police,"" the rider said.

African-American wants court to grant him Kenyan citizenship by ancestry,"An African-American who is seeking to be recognised as a Kenyan citizen by ancestry, has claimed that he suffered name-calling when he lived in the US.

While testifying before a Mombasa court, Mr Mubarak Abdul Muqsit Akram said since his childhood and into adulthood while in the US, he and his family were called “coloured people” among other derogatory names.

Mr Akram wants the court to order State authorities to issue him a Kenyan citizenship.

He says he chose to settle in Kenya because he feels it is close to him, adding that Kenyans are good people.

“I have chosen Kenya and not other countries. My choice of Kenya as my ancestral home is informed by the fact that modern-day Kenya was part of the larger African territory from where my descendants were forcibly caught and enslaved to America,” says Mr Akram.

Mr Akram, who was testifying before Justice Olga Sewe, added that Kenya is closer to the Red Sea where he can cross over and visit holy sites.

He explained that his parents were African-American and not Caucasian, as such he believes he has an inalienable right to return to his motherland and ancestral home, which is in Africa.

“I’m gainfully employed and not seeking any compensation from Kenya. I request a Kenyan identity card and passport. I am not a refugee,” Mr Akram told Justice Sewe.

He says that, cognisant of his roots and heritage in the African continent, he visited Kenya briefly for the first time in 2003 and later returned in 2008, and ever since, he has found solace, warmth and comfort albeit as a “foreigner”.

The petitioner is seeking a declaration that under the rules of international law and the Constitution, his right to return to his ancestral home and the choice of Kenya as his country of return is guaranteed and ought to be protected by the State.

National Identity Card

Mr Akram also seeks an order that the Director of Immigration and Citizen Services be directed to within 30 days of the judgment, recognise him as a Kenyan citizen and issue him with a passport and National Identity Card as a right.

The petitioner says he has made several applications for registration as a Kenyan citizen to the Department of Immigration but has never received any response.

Mr Akram says he was born in the state of Texas in 1946 to African-American parents and that since his return to Kenya in 2008, he has established and registered several businesses which he runs from his operating base in Kwale County.



The petitioner, who holds a foreigner certificate, has sued the Cabinet Secretary for Interior, Department of Immigration and Citizen Services Director-General and the Attorney General.

Upon cross-examination by lawyer James Kemei for the AG, Mr Akram told the court that the Immigration Department issued him with a foreign certificate.

Legal and justifiable claim

Assistant Director of Immigration Services Ronnie Akedi, in his replying affidavit, states that the petitioner’s belief and conviction that Kenya is his motherland is misplaced and ill-advised.

“There is no probable justification as to how the petitioner has singled out Kenya, out of 54 African countries, as being the country where his descendants’ origins emanate way before the partition of Africa into modern-day states,” says Mr Akedi, adding that the petitioner’s investing in the country does not in itself present criteria for one to be registered as a citizen.

Mr Akedi says the petition does not disclose any legal and justifiable claim against the respondents and that it ought to be dismissed.

According to the petitioner, his choice of Kenya as his ancestral home is anchored in and informed by the provisions of The Abuja Proclamation — a declaration of the Pan African Conference on reparations for African enslavement, colonisation and neo-colonisation, which was sponsored by the African Union held in Nigeria in April 1993.

The petitioner says that among the provisions of the proclamation was a declaration calling upon all African states “to grant entrance as of right to all persons of African descent and right to obtain residence in those African states if there is no disqualifying element on African claiming the right to return to his ancestral home”.

Hearing resumes on June 12.

Sende Moto: Inside an estate's struggle for a blessing,"To a stranger visiting Engineer Town in Nyandarua County for the first time, learning about Sende Moto estate might be shocking.

The estate’s name is notorious for its reputation for crime, prostitution and other illicit activities.

Of concern is that it has been a thorn in the flesh of law enforcers in the Kinangop area and is infamous for prostitution, murders, rape and being a notorious criminal hideout.

Locals, however, view the name as routine and unremarkable and having grown up there and knowing it since childhood, it's no big deal. The area is also well known for all the wrong reasons, including brothels and illicit brews.

Despite Sende Moto’s proximity to the Engineer Police Station and sub-County headquarters, it remains a headache for law enforcement officers.

“It is not unusual to hear someone shout in the streets that they are heading to Sende Moto, or identifying a person living there by that name. This is similar to how residents of big cities proudly identify with their urban dwelling,” says Joy Gachiri, a resident.

Previous attempts to cleanse the area have been in vain, as have been efforts by religious leaders to rename the area from Sende Moto to Kirathimo (blessings).

There is a common belief that ""the only thing one can't find at Sende Moto is life, but you can lose one there.”

Mugo Nyakerie, a resident, describes the place as a ""carefree world, where patrons can enjoy their life without fear. Things that happen there remain a guarded secret, whether they are done during the day or under the cover of darkness.""

Mugo told Nation.Africa he lost his property due to the estate's alluring lifestyle. He owned a shop and a plot within Engineer Town but took refuge in alcohol due to domestic squabbles.

He ended up selling the land in Sende Moto during one of the drinking sprees.

""This place is a comfort zone for anyone looking for peace, and you will get all the happiness you need. Most of those who have lost property were swindled by twilight girls and were easily lured by the cheap life at Sende Moto. Deals involving illicit land, vehicles, and other transactions are sealed at Sende Moto. Men have lost their property, and families have been auctioned since their property was sold and deals were sealed at Sende Moto. One can always get drunk with or without money,” he said.

Cleansing prayers

In November 2019, the clergy began cleansing the place with prayer sessions and anointments.

But Sende Moto has remained.

Bishop Mbuthia Njoroge, who led another clergy in cleansing the area, said the estate had destroyed families, with many men selling their land without family consent.

""The estate had also swallowed many businesses both small and prominent. By the word of prayer and confessions, we are never going to hear of murders, defilement, and rape incidents in this estate. Our youth, men, and women are going to change,"" said Bishop Mbuthia, who also chairs the local pastors' lobby.

However, Ms Gachiri believes that the cleansing by the clergy needs sustained efforts.

""We are talking of a community lifestyle, a lifestyle they have enjoyed for decades, some of them were born there. We can't change the name of a place before understanding that community, their lifestyle, and why they have accepted the lifestyle as a means of life. The change needed to start with reforming the residents, getting them alternative means of living,"" said the businesswoman.

She adds that life is affordable at Sende Moto, such that with Sh100, one will feed, get drunk, and enjoy cheap sex.

“It's only at Sende Moto where you can have a meal at Sh10 or Sh20, a cup of soup retails at Sh10, and a toast at Sh10, that is enough lunch for low-income earners. Most of the meals retail at Sh20 at Sende Moto, why would anyone leave such an affordable lifestyle without a better alternative? You can get a piece of meat at Sh10, but you don’t have to ask what animal it is or where it came from, that is why it's impossible for things to change at Sende Moto,” explained Ms Gachiri.

Cheaper housing

Rental houses are also affordable at Sende Moto, with monthly rent between Sh300 and Sh500.

Senior Chief Magdalene Kariuki shares these sentiments and notes that things have improved since the mass closure of bars in the area.

“We did everything to change the lifestyle, we had many prayer sessions and anointments but things have remained the same. All the bars in that estate were closed down, but we have a challenge because that is where most of the commercial sex workers reside. Unfortunately, most of them are not from Engineer Town, they come from neighbouring Laikipia and Nakuru counties, and some are from very far away,"" she said.

Chief Kariuki suggests that a lasting solution involves getting alternative sources of income for commercial sex workers.

""If we can change and positively keep the women busy, then we will have succeeded, Sende Moto will be the Kirathimo estate we want. I thank the national government for its commitment to fighting and eradicating alcoholic and drug consumption and trade. That support has helped, and the situation has improved at Sende Moto,"" said the administrator.

Of concern is that it has been a thorn in the flesh of law enforcers in the Kinangop area and is infamous for prostitution, murders, rape and being a notorious criminal hideout.

Locals, however, view the name as routine and unremarkable and having grown up there and knowing it since childhood, it's no big deal. The area is also well known for all the wrong reasons, including brothels and illicit brews.

Despite Sende Moto’s proximity to the Engineer Police Station and sub-County headquarters, it remains a headache for law enforcement officers.

“It is not unusual to hear someone shout in the streets that they are heading to Sende Moto, or identifying a person living there by that name. This is similar to how residents of big cities proudly identify with their urban dwelling,” says Joy Gachiri, a resident.

Previous attempts to cleanse the area have been in vain, as have been efforts by religious leaders to rename the area from Sende Moto to Kirathimo (blessings).

There is a common belief that ""the only thing one can't find at Sende Moto is life, but you can lose one there.”

Mugo Nyakerie, a resident, describes the place as a ""carefree world, where patrons can enjoy their life without fear. Things that happen there remain a guarded secret, whether they are done during the day or under the cover of darkness.""

Mugo told Nation.Africa he lost his property due to the estate's alluring lifestyle. He owned a shop and a plot within Engineer Town but took refuge in alcohol due to domestic squabbles.

He ended up selling the land in Sende Moto during one of the drinking sprees.

""This place is a comfort zone for anyone looking for peace, and you will get all the happiness you need. Most of those who have lost property were swindled by twilight girls and were easily lured by the cheap life at Sende Moto. Deals involving illicit land, vehicles, and other transactions are sealed at Sende Moto. Men have lost their property, and families have been auctioned since their property was sold and deals were sealed at Sende Moto. One can always get drunk with or without money,” he said.

Cleansing prayers

In November 2019, the clergy began cleansing the place with prayer sessions and anointments.

But Sende Moto has remained.

Bishop Mbuthia Njoroge, who led another clergy in cleansing the area, said the estate had destroyed families, with many men selling their land without family consent.

""The estate had also swallowed many businesses both small and prominent. By the word of prayer and confessions, we are never going to hear of murders, defilement, and rape incidents in this estate. Our youth, men, and women are going to change,"" said Bishop Mbuthia, who also chairs the local pastors' lobby.

However, Ms Gachiri believes that the cleansing by the clergy needs sustained efforts.

""We are talking of a community lifestyle, a lifestyle they have enjoyed for decades, some of them were born there. We can't change the name of a place before understanding that community, their lifestyle, and why they have accepted the lifestyle as a means of life. The change needed to start with reforming the residents, getting them alternative means of living,"" said the businesswoman.

She adds that life is affordable at Sende Moto, such that with Sh100, one will feed, get drunk, and enjoy cheap sex.

“It's only at Sende Moto where you can have a meal at Sh10 or Sh20, a cup of soup retails at Sh10, and a toast at Sh10, that is enough lunch for low-income earners. Most of the meals retail at Sh20 at Sende Moto, why would anyone leave such an affordable lifestyle without a better alternative? You can get a piece of meat at Sh10, but you don’t have to ask what animal it is or where it came from, that is why it's impossible for things to change at Sende Moto,” explained Ms Gachiri.

Cheaper housing

Rental houses are also affordable at Sende Moto, with monthly rent between Sh300 and Sh500.

Senior Chief Magdalene Kariuki shares these sentiments and notes that things have improved since the mass closure of bars in the area.

“We did everything to change the lifestyle, we had many prayer sessions and anointments but things have remained the same. All the bars in that estate were closed down, but we have a challenge because that is where most of the commercial sex workers reside. Unfortunately, most of them are not from Engineer Town, they come from neighbouring Laikipia and Nakuru counties, and some are from very far away,"" she said.

Chief Kariuki suggests that a lasting solution involves getting alternative sources of income for commercial sex workers.

""If we can change and positively keep the women busy, then we will have succeeded, Sende Moto will be the Kirathimo estate we want. I thank the national government for its commitment to fighting and eradicating alcoholic and drug consumption and trade. That support has helped, and the situation has improved at Sende Moto,"" said the administrator.

"Israeli attack on Rafah tent camp kills 45, prompts international outcry","CAIRO/JERUSALEM, May 27 - An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.

Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties.

""In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,"" he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers.

Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.

""We were praying... and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,"" said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf.

""All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.""

Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames.

More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.

Medics later said an Israeli airstrike on Monday on a house in Rafah had killed seven Palestinians, with several others wounded.

Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on ""precise intelligence"", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.

That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip.

Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

The U.S. urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion.

""Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said. ""But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.""

French President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""outraged"" over Israel's latest attacks. ""These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,"" he said on X. Several thousand demonstrators later gathered in Paris to protest against the offensive in Gaza.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected.

""International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,"" Baerbock said.

Canada's government said it was ""horrified"" by the deadly airstrike in Rafah, and called for an immediate ceasefire.

""Canada does not support an Israeli military operation in Rafah,"" Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a post on X. ""This level of human suffering must come to an end.""

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange.

NO SAFE ZONE

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings.

Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds.

Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze.

""The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,"" he said.

The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned ""the heinous massacre."" Egypt also condemned Israel's ""deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people"", state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law.

On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.

Egypt's military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating.

Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said.

In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said.

Teen gang sucks life out of vibrant Tana River town,"It is no longer safe to be out and about after dusk in Madogo town.

A marauding gang of teenage criminals christened the “Kayole Brothers”, has taken over the bustling urban settlement that used to be the pride of Tana River County as the only town that operated 24 hours a day in the region.

But now, when darkness falls, terrorised residents shut themselves in their houses hoping for the best but resigned to their fate.

By 6pm, businesses begin to close and by half past 7pm, the town yields to the darkness, opening the door for the teenage gangsters to reign.

A power blackout that has persisted for the past 30 days has made matters worse.

“I have had to retrench workers from my pub business because we can’t operate at night and running a generator has proved to be too expensive,” Mr Japheth Mutua, who operates a bar in the town, told the Nation on Monday.

Gang protection fees

For those willing to risk it and run their businesses till daybreak, they must pay the gang protection fees.

The criminals charge Sh1,000 per night for bar owners and Sh500 for shopkeepers and hoteliers. The protection fee is, however, valid only while within the premises and the client's safety while outside is not a guarantee.

Residents leaving work at night have also mastered the art of negotiating with the delinquents for their security.

“I part with Sh100 every day to be escorted home. Once I leave work, I must tag along with one of them or else I become a target,” said Ms Anne Silwa, a shop attendant.

Tana River County Police Commander Ali Ndiema told the Nation that patrols have been intensified.

He notes that whereas the teen gang dubbed the “Kayole Brothers” is a menace, security officers have reduced their activities and influence around the town.

“We are doing our best and appeal to residents to support us by reporting cases of crime and helping us to catch these characters instead of tolerating them,"" he said.

Further, he warned that parents of suspected gang members will equally be held responsible for crimes committed by their children if they are arrested.

“Every parent should know where their children are. If we get bad reports or we happen to arrest any child involved in criminal activities, the parent will also be charged for conspiracy,"" he said.

Madogo is in darkness because the electricity poles for the main power line fell as a result of the flooding along the Madogo-Garissa highway.

The lack of power has inconvenienced residents. The few people who are able to own solar panels are charging phones for people at a fee of Sh50.

Clean water has also become scarce because electric water motors cannot be used as a result of the blackout. Locals are forced to buy water from vendors or fetch from River Tana amid a cholera crisis in the county.

""We are suffering, businesses are making big losses and others cannot operate. People are losing jobs. This is killing our economy,"" said Hashim Bamaru, a resident.

Schools are not able to have evening preps, and management of the learning institutions are spending a lot of money to buy water.

Residents say that their appeal to Kenya Power Company to restore electricity has fallen on deaf ears.

Restoring power line

""Nobody is explaining to us the difficulty in restoring the power line. We are not seeing any explanation online nor have heard anything on the radio. They just decided to ignore us,"" said Mohamed Abdikadir, a resident.

Human rights activists have announced a week-long protest if the situation is not resolved at the end of a seven-day ultimatum.

“These people have a right to Kenya Power services and they have a right to proper explanation. If Kenya Power is having a problem we should be told so that we can know the way forward,” said James Rashid, secretary-general Civil Society Organisations Network.

Kenya Power County Manager Silas Limo said flood waters from River Tana knocked down electricity poles.

""We are keen to restore power in Madogo, but the area is still flooded, so it may take time to fix the poles. I appeal for patience,” Mr Limo said.

Embu farmers fight ban of ‘muguka’ in Mombasa,"Farmers in Embu have vowed to fight the ban on muguka business in Mombasa and Kilifi amid calls by leaders in Coast for other counties in the region to follow suit.

On Saturday, Embu Deputy Governor Kinyua Mugo and Woman Representative Njoki Njeru led local residents in a demonstration in Embu town, causing a major traffic snarl-up.

They criticised Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir over the decision, saying they were not consulted to give their views before the ban was imposed.

“It is unfair for Mombasa to ban the sale of muguka, which is a cash crop that locals depend on for survival. Growing and selling of muguka is a legal business and the position taken in Mombasa is illegal,” said Ms Njeru.

A farmer, Mr Samuel Gitonga, lamented that they would not survive without the trade.

“The decision will kill our livelihoods. We shall continue taking to the streets until the ban is revoked,” said Mr Gitonga.

Close muguka outlets

Mombasa is the largest market for muguka nationally. Mr Nassir has ordered the closure of all muguka outlets in the region and directed county officials to enforce the directive with immediate effect.

“By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and existing laws ... hereby order and direct that there be a total prohibition on the entry, transportation and use of muguka and its products within Mombasa County,” he said.

The governor explained that he had made the decision after considering the sentiments of the residents during a public participation exercise and consulting the National Authority for the Campaign Against Drug and Alcohol Abuse (Nacada).

Mr Nassir said his administration had a constitutional responsibility to promote the right to health of residents and instil health consciousness among them.

“Scientific evidence has equivocally established that muguka consumption causes mental health issues and disability. Muguka leads to devastating health, social-economic, and environmental consequences and places a heavy burden on minors, families, the poor and the county’s health infrastructure,” he said.

Farmers deliver 36 tonnes of muguka to Mombasa every day on average, earning them Sh10.8 million. They said Mombasa county started imposing heavy levies on muguka, with each lorry entering the county being charged Sh80,000 in a bid to kill their businesses.

Another farmer, Mr Edwin Munene, said plans are underway to obtain a court order restraining Governor Nassir from having his ban implemented.

Increased immorality

At the same time, leaders from Kilifi County among them Gender, Culture and National Heritage Cabinet Secretary Aisha Jumwa have urged other coastal counties to follow suit.

Speaking in Ganze, the leaders blamed the stimulant for alleged increased immorality and poor health among the youth.

Nairobi-based lawyer George Kithi vowed to represent Mombasa and Kilifi counties in court if Embu County leaders filed a lawsuit to oppose the ban.

“I want to laud Governor [Gideon]Mung’aro for banning the substance since it has destroyed our youth. The youth spend their day time and night chewing the substance and when they go home they cannot perform. We want a stable society,” Ganze MP Kenneth Kazungu said.

Ms Jumwa security agencies to enforce the bans in Kilifi and Mombasa counties.

“I have heard people saying that they are going to court and I want to tell them that we will not be scared and we shall fight for the ban to stay,” she said while urging the national government to support the ban. She termed as ironical the fact that leaders from the Mt Kenya region were in support of the fight against counterfeit alcohol but did not want Coast leaders to fight the sale of muguka in the region.

“The national government should support this fight and people should not just look at the aspect of business in muguka. They should also consider the lives and health of the people of the Coast. I fully support the President in the fight against all illicit substances,” said Mr Kazungu.","By

“Scientific evidence has equivocally established that muguka consumption causes mental health issues and disability. Muguka leads to devastating health, social-economic, and environmental consequences and places a heavy burden on minors, families, the poor and the county’s health infrastructure,” he said.

Farmers deliver 36 tonnes of muguka to Mombasa every day on average, earning them Sh10.8 million. They said Mombasa county started imposing heavy levies on muguka, with each lorry entering the county being charged Sh80,000 in a bid to kill their businesses.

Another farmer, Mr Edwin Munene, said plans are underway to obtain a court order restraining Governor Nassir from having his ban implemented.

Increased immorality

At the same time, leaders from Kilifi County among them Gender, Culture and National Heritage Cabinet Secretary Aisha Jumwa have urged other coastal counties to follow suit.

Speaking in Ganze, the leaders blamed the stimulant for alleged increased immorality and poor health among the youth.

Nairobi-based lawyer George Kithi vowed to represent Mombasa and Kilifi counties in court if Embu County leaders filed a lawsuit to oppose the ban.

“I want to laud Governor [Gideon]Mung’aro for banning the substance since it has destroyed our youth. The youth spend their day time and night chewing the substance and when they go home they cannot perform. We want a stable society,” Ganze MP Kenneth Kazungu said.

Ms Jumwa security agencies to enforce the bans in Kilifi and Mombasa counties.

“I have heard people saying that they are going to court and I want to tell them that we will not be scared and we shall fight for the ban to stay,” she said while urging the national government to support the ban. She termed as ironical the fact that leaders from the Mt Kenya region were in support of the fight against counterfeit alcohol but did not want Coast leaders to fight the sale of muguka in the region.

“The national government should support this fight and people should not just look at the aspect of business in muguka. They should also consider the lives and health of the people of the Coast. I fully support the President in the fight against all illicit substances,” said Mr Kazungu.","By

Trump booed and heckled by raucous crowd at Libertarian convention,"Washington,

Presidential candidate Donald Trump was booed and heckled by many in a raucous audience at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night, a marked change from the adulation he receives at rallies from his fervently loyal supporters.

Libertarians, who believe in limited government and individual freedom, blame Trump, a Republican, for rushing through the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and for not doing more to stop public health restrictions on the unvaccinated during the pandemic.

When Trump took to the stage in Washington, there were loud boos and jeers. A smaller section of the crowd, Trump supporters, cheered him.

Shortly before he appeared, one Libertarian Party member shouted: ""Donald Trump should have taken a bullet!""

Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hostile reception.

Trump, who was president between 2017 and 2021, immediately mentioned the total 88 felony charges he faces in four federal and state prosecutions.

""If I wasn't a libertarian I am now,"" he said. He denounced the administration of President Joe Biden, his challenger in the November 5 election rematch, and Biden's fellow Democrats as being part of a ""rise in left-wing fascism"".

Trump was trying to appeal to libertarians, who have more in common with Republican policy positions than Democrats on issues including taxes and the size of government, in what is expected to be a closely fought election.

1.8 million votes

He added: ""We should not be fighting each other."" He asked libertarians to work with him to defeat Biden, an appeal which was greeted by many boos, although the vast majority in the crowd were fiercely opposed to Biden and his administration.

Libertarians garnered only 1.2 percent of the national vote in 2020, or about 1.8 million votes, but November's election could be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states, so Trump is seeking to peel away some libertarian support.

Trump's appearance at the libertarian gathering, unusual for a Republican White House candidate, also signalled how seriously he and his campaign take the threat of third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long opposed vaccines and mandates, and who spoke to the convention on Friday.

Trump has been ramping up attacks on Kennedy, who is running as an independent, recently calling him a ""fake"" anti-vaccination proponent.

Opinion polls suggest Kennedy will siphon votes away from both Trump and Biden, but it is not yet clear which of the major-party candidates will be hurt more by Kennedy's long-shot White House bid.

Libertarian Party

Libertarian Party organisers said Biden was also invited to speak to the convention but he declined to attend.

""The Libertarian Party can make a big difference. If we unite we will be unstoppable,"" Trump said to a mix of applause and jeers.

Trump said he was a ""libertarian without even trying to be one,"" and that the Libertarian Party should endorse him, another line greeted by boos and jeers.

Undeterred, Trump poked fun at the crowd, saying if they did not back him, they would continue to garner just a tiny portion of voter support in national elections.

He pledged to put a libertarian in his cabinet if he wins the election, which was met by cries of ""bullshit!""

Trump did get huge applause for one promise. A rallying cry for libertarians is the case of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a life sentence for creating and operating the website Silk Road, which allowed users to secretly buy and sell drugs and other illegal products.

Libertarians believe Ulbricht's 2015 sentence represents government and judicial overreach. In front of a crowd holding ""Free Ross"" signs, Trump promised to commute Ulbricht's sentence if he wins back the White House.","By

,"Sitting in a makeshift shade on a seat with two cushions and two pillows for comfort, he nodded as he sang along to some gospel hymns playing in the background.

This is where Moses Kiprop Rerimoi, 28, from Kipkoriony Village in Eldama Ravine, has been staying since February 2016 after being discharged from the hospital following a road accident that left him immobile.

Despite his condition, he manages to put a smile on his face as he sits down on the sofa to exchange pleasantries.

Kiprop's father, Symon Cheruiyot, remembers the fateful day as if it were yesterday. It was on August 6, 2015, when family members, relatives and friends had gathered at a hotel in Kabarnet town to fundraise for his elder brother, Dennis Rerimoi, then a student at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), who was to fly to India for a kidney transplant.

Diagnosed with diabetes

Dennis had been diagnosed with diabetes in 2000, and his situation worsened, leading to kidney failure in 2004.

In the afternoon of the same day, Kiprop, who was in Form Four, preparing to sit his national examination the following term, had closed school for a holiday and joined his family members for the funding in town.

Shortly after, Kiprop was sent to pick something in their Kaptimbor home, on the outskirts of the town, close to a kilometre away. He rode a motorcycle to save time.

That is when their world came crumbling down. Some few minutes after leaving, they received reports that their third-born son had lost control of the motorcycle he was riding at Kapkogorwa village and crashed his head on a stone.

“I don’t even want to remember the feeling I had after I received the news of my son’s accident, but all the same, I had to be strong to handle the situation. We were just going on with arrangements to fundraise for his elder brother, who was set to be flown to India for a kidney transplant when I received a call that Kiprop had been involved in an accident, a kilometre away from Kabarnet town,” said Mr Cheruiyot.

“He was a Form Four candidate at that time and he had closed school for the August holiday that particular day. We sent him to go and pick something at home, little did we know that could be a turning point in our lives, adding to the myriad of tribulations we had. I was forced to leave the fundraiser and attend to him in hospital,” added the distraught father.

At the accident scene, the motorcycle was a wreck, and his head was seriously injured after he crushed it into a stone after he lost control.

Specialised treatment

He was rushed to the Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabarnet and later referred to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret for specialised treatment.

Due to his condition, Kiprop needed to be in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), but the bed capacity at MTRH at the time was exhausted.

“I remember we had a challenge in getting admission in the ICU and went for three more facilities in Eldoret without success, eventually, he was finally admitted at the Reale Hospital. He underwent a head surgery the following day and the medics indicated that he had suffered a brain damage that even cracked the inner membrane of the skull,” said Cheruiyot.

After the surgery, he was in the ICU for more than 21 days. He later spent more than six months in the general ward after his family failed to raise the medical bill that had accrued to more than Sh3 million.

“He was discharged on October 6, 2015, but we had drained all the funds we had to pay the medical bills that had accumulated to more than Sh3 million. We were retained until February the following year after the family fundraised for some amount and Kiprop’s grandmother also parted with her title deed,” he explained.

A month after his discharge, Mr Cheruiyot had to organise another funds drive to take his second-born son Dennis for a kidney transplant in India - he travelled with him and his first-born son, who was also the donor.

After undergoing a successful kidney transplant at Indraprastha Apolo, New Delhi Hospital in India, the family got another challenge after Dennis suffered some complications, prompting some more stay and money for treatment at the ICU.

The family had to sell their two remaining cows to finance their upkeep in India as they planned another fundraiser.

Road accident

They were discharged from the facility months later but needed to spend more than Sh20,000 every month on his drugs and another Sh20,000 for his bedridden brother, who was still recuperating from the injuries he sustained in the road accident.

Sadly, Dennis died in February 2021, six years after undergoing a kidney transplant.

“We have exhausted all we had in treating our two sons. So far, we have spent more than Sh10 million in their treatment. Sadly, Dennis died in 2021 due to complications. Kiprop is still bedridden owing to the injuries he sustained in the accident, and he still needs more money to take him for further medication,” said Mr Cheruiyot.

“It has been a challenge because, after the accident, Kiprop is dependent on people in almost everything because he cannot move on his own. The brain damage made him immobile and he also suffered a memory lapse. In recent years, we also realised that his left leg has turned shorter than the other, indicating that there is a problem,” he explained.

According to the father of four, his bedridden son uses three diapers every day and medication at a cost of Sh10,000 every day.

“My mother deposited her title deed in the hospital as a surety to allow him to get discharged in hospital in 2016 because we could not manage to offset the Sh3.3 million. To date, we still have a debt of more than Sh2.1 which we have not settled yet due to the myriad of challenges. We are also appealing to well-wishers to allow us to take him for further medication because his situation has not improved,” he noted.

“We fear that our land will be auctioned if we do not settle the debt as agreed,” added Cheruiyot.

Pauline Cheruiyot, Kiprop’s mother, couldn't contain her emotions.

“We have had a challenge since 2000 after Dennis was diagnosed with diabetes which later led to kidney failure. After spending more than Sh6 million on his treatment and kidney transplant in 2016, he died six years later. Before he was flown to India, his younger brother was involved in an accident that had made him bedridden for years. It is so painful as a mother seeing your children just slip away like that,” said Pauline while fighting back tears.

Suffered complications

“I even remember that when my husband and our two sons went to India, they were detained after Dennis suffered complications after the transplant, forcing him to be put in an ICU thus inflating the bill. Back at home, I was nursing Kiprop after being released from the hospital following the accident. I had to sell our two remaining cows at the time for their upkeep in the foreign land. Since then, life for us has been tough. We just appeal for help to take our bedridden son for further checkup and treatment,” said Pauline.

With a visible scar on his face, a sharp reminder of the motorcycle crash in 2016, Kiprop, who is struggling to communicate owing to the memory lapse, is very hopeful that he will one day stand on his feet.

“I am appealing for help from well-wishers to help me walk again. My feet are very feeble owing to the accident I was involved in but I am very certain with further medication, I would walk again. Every morning after doing some exercises and being assisted by my father to take a bath, I am forced to sit on this seat under the shade as we pass the day with my grandmother,” said Kiprop.

Chief Kadhi Abdulhalim Athman stops man from evicting estranged wife,"Chief Kadhi has issued an order stopping a man from evicting his estranged wife from their matrimonial home or taking anything from it, pending the hearing and conclusion of a case involving a property dispute between the couple.

Chief Kadhi Abdulhalim Athman said the woman, identified as MAM, will suffer irreparable damage if she is evicted from the matrimonial home and her household items are taken away.

""MAM has nowhere else to go and her right to dignity, housing and accommodation will be prejudiced,"" he said.

At the same time, Chief Kadhi has temporarily delegated the management of the property to an estate agent while a dispute between the couple over its ownership is resolved.

The agent will be selected by the couple's lawyers and approved by the High Court before taking charge of the property, which includes rental houses, and collecting rent.

Rental houses

""The rent proceeds will be distributed as follows while this matter is pending: 35 per cent to the woman and 65 per cent to the man,"" said Chief Kadhi Athman.

However, Chief Kadhi ruled that the man, identified as the COR, had contributed significantly to the construction and development of the rental houses.

""He will thus suffer more damages than the MAM if the orders sought are granted as prayed,"" he said.

Since both parties would incur losses in the event of an unfavourable ruling, Sheikh Athman ordered that the rent be collected and distributed according to the contribution ratio until the dispute was resolved.

Last year, the woman went to court to seek injunctions against the man, his family members or representatives to prevent them from entering, building, trespassing or interfering with her matrimonial home, property and property rights.

She complained that the COR had threatened to evict tenants from rental houses and to collect all household items from the matrimonial home.

The man, however, opposed the application and requested that it be dismissed.

Court records show that the parties were married more than 10 years ago under Islamic law.

Matrimonial home

They initially lived together in rented houses owned by the woman's mother, before jointly purchasing a plot of land on her mother's land and building three-bedroom houses. The man worked abroad to earn an income and often visited his wife in Kenya.

Sometime in 2011, they bought an additional plot of land next to their matrimonial home and built rental houses on it.

Following the completion of this project, ownership and management became a point of contention between the couple.

The court noted that there was no dispute that the parties were still legally married under Islamic law, that the matrimonial home was purchased jointly, and that the rental houses were built during the marriage on land originally owned by the woman's relatives.

""However, the court has the right and authority to declare the rights of the parties to the disputed matrimonial property,"" Sheikh Athman said.

The Chief Kadhi, however, noted that the division of matrimonial property begins upon the dissolution of the marriage.

She complained that the COR had threatened to evict tenants from rental houses and to collect all household items from the matrimonial home.

The man, however, opposed the application and requested that it be dismissed.

Court records show that the parties were married more than 10 years ago under Islamic law.

Matrimonial home

They initially lived together in rented houses owned by the woman's mother, before jointly purchasing a plot of land on her mother's land and building three-bedroom houses. The man worked abroad to earn an income and often visited his wife in Kenya.

Sometime in 2011, they bought an additional plot of land next to their matrimonial home and built rental houses on it.

Following the completion of this project, ownership and management became a point of contention between the couple.

The court noted that there was no dispute that the parties were still legally married under Islamic law, that the matrimonial home was purchased jointly, and that the rental houses were built during the marriage on land originally owned by the woman's relatives.

""However, the court has the right and authority to declare the rights of the parties to the disputed matrimonial property,"" Sheikh Athman said.

The Chief Kadhi, however, noted that the division of matrimonial property begins upon the dissolution of the marriage.

,"It is 8am on a Friday in Masol area, West Pokot. A bare-chested man, with a kikoi wrapped around his waist stands atop dung that has just been scooped from a goat's stomach. The man's hair, legs, hands, and chest are smeared with the goat dung.

He is Tulel Ng'uriangole, a 35-yearold. An elderly man holds Tulel's hand and turns him around for another man to smear a new, thicker layer of goat dung on his head. They complete the ritual.

Tulel puts on his sandals and carries his spear, the one he had used to kill the goat, and leaves the men to lap up the raw blood, directly from the belly of the goat. Welcome to Sapana, a ceremony held among the Pokot to usher a man into manhood. Without this dung-smearing and killing an animal with a spear, a man is not considered man enough to marry.

The smearing with dung, fresh from a goat’s stomach by a respected elder, is a sign of wiping childhood into adulthood. When this dung session is done, Tulel holds the spear to prove that ""he can do it"" as ululations rent the air. There are tens of women and men here to feast and perform the ritual.

The men are wearing tiny shorts tucked inside kikois, the women in lokwa skirts and lots of beaded jewellery. The women are allowed to participate in the ceremony because they bring milk.

They jump up as they sing a Pokot chorus of folk songs. Other men are gathered at a bonfire in a semi-circle, and women on the other side are drinking fermented local wine. “I have never seen a huge crowd like this. I'm now a full man.

Now I will offer honey and organise another ceremony for thanksgiving to give out the honey,” Tulel says. The West portends evil According to Pokot tradition, a bull (not one whose tail has been cut, or without horns or a hollow eye) must lie facing the East for blessings, because the West brings about evil.

Tulel pierces the goat on its right side until it dies before it is burned over a fire, whole, without cutting it into pieces, a requirement in this ritual.

A special group of village men take over and open up the slaughtered animal, taking turns to lap up the clots of blood. Some of the blood is kept in a container to be mixed later with milk, a traditional delicacy to be shared. After all this is done, the goat is skinned and cut into pieces. The elders inspect it thoroughly while explaining the contours of the goat’s intestines to predict calamities, ranging from death to strange diseases, and forecast the weather pattern. From the intestines analysed today, it was established that the village would experience rain and everyone should go to the farm to cultivate.

The men then take their place in a semi-circle (Kriket) and wait for the animal to be cooked and served to them. Once the ‘sapana’ is over, a ""special kind of soil"" is applied on Tulel's head and he is adorned with brown ostrich feathers as the women dance in celebration. For decades, the Pokot community that lives in Northern Kenya has been known for its retrogressive cultural practices of cattle rustling and female genital mutilation (FGM), which are gradually dying off.

But there are positive ones, like the modern “Sapana” ritual, which centres on the initiation of boys into adulthood, and the gateway to manhood, which the elders hope will stay on.

Years ago, sapana was done to prepare men for war, but now it is a rite of passage for a man. 12 years Starting at around 12 years of age, young Pokot men would traditionally undergo the Sapana ritual.

The day before an initiation ceremony, the initiate climbs on the back of a cow near his home. On D-Day, the man who kills the bull, goat, or ram goes into the kraal, brandishing his spear. He pierces the bull on its right side.

Usually, a single thrust of the spear should kill the bull. It is directed at the heart. If the animal falls and fails to die, it must be pierced again, but that means the initiate is a sinner. William Lopetakou, a Pokot culture elder, says the Sapana ritual allows young men to sit at the table with the elders and take part in their community’s decision-making. Mr Lopetakou says the ritual originated from the Ateker Karamojong people in Uganda. “The Pokots have embraced it for many decades now.

The ceremony is somewhat religious to chase away evil spirits. It also brings togetherness. For instance, a wooden trough of milk is shared amongst all the people to remove bad omens,"" he says, ""and it reminds the Pokots of the respect they have for cows.

Read: Why 100-year-old Pokot fig tree remains untouched two years after it fell

After God comes a man, a cow, and then a woman."" He adds that the initiator is washed with milk to get rid of curses.

“This indicates that you are free from dirty things like sexually transmitted diseases,” Mr Lopetakou says. The ceremony also seals marriages. ""A married Pokot woman wears a traditional ring on her hand, through the Sapana rite.

If you try seducing such a woman, you are fined,” he says. With modernisation, he says, educated people have shunned the ceremony. “But an undergraduate degree or Master's degree alone doesn't make you a man.

Even if you have these, how will you interact with elders? The rite of passage will see you eat and drink with others, they no longer see you like a child,” he says. Julius Loparar, an elder from Nyangaita Village, says the ritual improves men's marriage prospects. ""Only after a Sapana are you able to negotiate dowry with the elders,"" he says.

Benson Lemnyang, the West Pokot Director of Culture and Heritage, says the ritual improves one’s chances for marriage, once the man and his family have accumulated a dowry of cattle,” he says.

John Muok, who is currently the Pokot Council of Elders Chairperson, and is 80 years old, underwent the rite when he was 25. He says he performed the ritual after marrying two wives. “I slaughtered a big bull. It was a great ceremony, and my parents were very happy to see how blessed I was,” he says.

Heroine Evelyn Prech, who is the Executive Director at the Center of Indigenous Child Rights, (CIC), says the county should start marketing the ceremony as a tourist attraction.

"Mombasa-Nairobi expressway will not hurt SGR, Murkomen assures traders","Construction of a six-lane Nairobi-Mombasa expressway that is expected to reduce travel time from Kenya’s capital to the coastal city to 4.5 hours, down from 10 and a half hours, will not affect the operations of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), the government has said.

Roads and Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen said the toll-road deal, which involves a 440-kilometer link between Nairobi, and Mombasa that serves as a gateway for several East African economies will complement the existing infrastructures to make the Northern Corridor more competitive.

Mr Murkomen dismissed fears that once the toll road is ready, the SGR will be disadvantaged as cargo shifts to road transport.

He added that the SGR extension, the Mombasa-Nairobi Expressway and later Rironi-Mau Summit Expressway will make the Northern Corridor an irresistible option for many businesses in the East and Central African region.

“I am the CS of both roads and rail [and can assure you] the government has no intention of prioritising one over the other. We shall ensure rail and road provide seamless flow of cargo from the port of Mombasa to other parts of the region,” said Mr Murkomen.

Speaking during the launch of the Kenya Railways Strategic Plan 2023-2027, the CS said the railway intends to increase cargo volumes from 26 percent to 42 percent in 2027.

“We are challenging Kenya Railways to improve its services to attract more users so as to attain its vision. The government will not favour any mode of transport by issuing mandatory use of rail edicts to increase its volumes,” Mr Murkomen pledged.

The announcement comes few days after local private investors were given a chance to participate in the financing of the Sh472.9 billion expressway after the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and US-based private equity Everstron Capital LLC signed a deal to kickstart construction.

""The road, dubbed ‘Usahihi’, is expected to have four to six lanes and will be constructed over the next 3-4 years.

""Usahihi will pay its way, not burdening the government as it is structured as a Public-Private Partnership with revenue coming from road users. Usahihi will organise finance, construction, tolling, operation, and maintenance of the expressway under a 30-year concession with construction lasting 3-4 years,"" read the press release announcing the deal.

The CS spoke a day after he held a virtual meeting with US Secretary for Transportation Pete Buttigieg on several areas of cooperation, including road safety, mass rapid transport and aviation.

Also Read: Explainer: Privileges Kenya will enjoy as a Major Non-Nato Ally

Mr Murkomen and Mr Buttigieg discussed green transport in the Nairobi Metropolitan Area and explored avenues for knowledge exchange and capacity building in the sector.

Apart from the Mombasa-Nairobi expressway, the government is committed to extending the SGR from Naivasha to Malaba on the border with Uganda and beyond to enhance competitiveness of the Northern Transport Corridor.

“To this end, we will collaborate with the Interstate Ministerial Committee on the SGR Cluster to explore viable financial options to ensure that SGR extends from Malaba through Kasese in Uganda and finally Kisangani, in the DR Congo, to boost regional trade,” said Mr Murkomen.

He said the Kenya Railways Strategic Plan 2023-2027 is meant to steer the implementation of priority initiatives in the rail transport sector over the next five years.

The Plan outlines ambitious goals for Kenya Railways, including the development and enhancement of rail infrastructure, expansion of freight and passenger transport, increasing market share of the port of Mombasa, fostering a skilled workforce, and institutionalising Environmental, Social, and Governance standards.

,"On April 23, this year, James Muturi Gathaiya got a Sh50 job to deliver a parcel to an address at Thika Greens Phase III Estate in Murang'a.

Gathaiya, 38, was living in the compound of a benefactor.

He had gone to spend the evening at a nearby wines and spirits shop when the assignment to deliver a Sh350 bottle of vodka presented itself.

""I was with Gathaiya when the owner of the liquor shop told him that a neighbour had placed an order through the phone for a 250ml Vodka,"" Mr Frank Kiriinya recounts.

He says the owner of the liquor store knew that Gathaiya lived in that estate and sent him to make the delivery at a fee.

""Gathaiya took the parcel and set off at around 6.30pm,"" Mr Kiriinya recounts in an interview with Nation.Africa.

The owner of Edwinpark Liquor Store, Mr Moses Kimani, confirmed he sent Gathaiya to deliver the parcel.

Make online payment

""Residents of Thika Greens often place phone orders and make payments online. They give their addresses and I send motorcycle riders to make the deliveries,"" Mr Kimani explains.

""I offered Gathaiya the opportunity to deliver the parcel and earn the Sh50 since it was near where he stayed,” he told the Nation.

Read: 'They killed my son after I failed to pay Sh100'

But it would turn out to be a deadly assignment. The young man who had placed the order was a recovering addict. He had just been discharged from a rehabilitation centre after battling addiction.

Gathaiya is reported to have walked into the compound carrying the liquor where he met the recovering addict's mother.

Liquor store

According to witnesses, he handed over the parcel to the woman and told her that it was from the liquor store before hell broke loose.

""The woman, upon unwrapping the parcel, found that it was alcohol. She screamed and drew the attention of the security guards manning the entry of the gated community estate,"" says a guard at the estate who sought anonymity.

The guard told Nation.Africa that the young man’s mother ordered the guards to discipline Gathaiya.

""The bitter woman participated in the beating of Gathaiya while screaming that she had spent a fortune treating her son,"" the guard said.

He claims they were paid to discipline Gathaiya who was known to them. He also alleges that he called the family that was hosting Gathaiya when he realised that things  were getting out of hand.

Ms Joyce Ndirangu explains she took Gathaiya in 2018.

""He (Gathaiya) told me he was an orphan from Nakuru who was facing rejection from his relatives. I took him in as a farm help. He was a disciplined, peaceful and religious man,"" Ms Ndirangu says.

She says she received a distressing call, asking her to hurry up to the Nyumba ya Mzungu location as Gathaiya was in trouble and sent her son to find out what was happening.

""My son called me moments later to inform me the guards were very hostile and that Gathaiya was in dire need of help,"" she recalls.

Her son said he watched helplessly from a distance as the beatings continued. The angry woman, according to him, was cursing all those people who expose people's children to substance abuse.

After the beating, the guard claims, his colleagues bundled their victim in the woman’s car and dumped him on a nearby road.

""Gathaiya was so weak and he fell headfirst on the road,"" the guard says.

What happened next to the injured Gathaiya is unclear because of conflicting accounts. Some reports allege he was deliberately run over by a car.

However, the woman at the centre of the incident says she heard he was hit by a vehicle. The woman, whom we cannot name for legal reasons, claims police told her the victim died in a road accident.

""He was disciplined at my place for illegally peddling alcohol in my compound. He was let to go and I hear he was hit by a vehicle,"" she insists.

She adds that ""you should identify with the pain of losing a son to those selling poison and they dare bring it to him while he is fresh from rehab.”



Cause of death

A police vehicle took the body to General Kago Mortuary where the drama continued amid accusations of an attempt to cover up the cause of death.

Mr Kennedy Kimathi, who introduced himself as Gathaiya's friend, says he went to the mortuary to identify the body.

""I found that police had ordered that no one should be allowed to view the body unless in the company of officers or with a court order,"" Mr Kimathi says.

""A female officer kept vigil in the mortuary and at one time declared that Gathaiya should be buried as soon as possible. The officer said she was willing to foot the bill for Gathaiya's burial so as ‘to put the incident behind us,”’ he claims.

Pathologist John Mathaiya, who performed a postmortem examination on Gathaiya’s body on May 2, says his findings were classified by security as confidential.

""As such, the findings can only be availed in a judicial process and not to members of the public,"" Mr Mathaiya says.

According to an investigation report by Gatanga sub-county police the Nation.Africa confidentially saw, ""Gathaiya, who has since been buried in Nakuru County, died in a road accident.”

The report does not mention anything to do with the delivery job, assault at the woman’s home and dumping of the body even after Mr Kiriinya and Mr Kimathi offered to record statements about the incident.

Murang'a County Commissioner Joshua Nkanatha says the security committee he chairs has received some information about the incident and he has ordered that a report of the facts be made available to him as soon as possible.

Mr Nkanatha adds, ""Officers have since been dispatched to verify the claims and all available witness statements be recorded. I have also ordered that a copy of the postmortem examination report be made available to us.”

He says the matter urgently requires a public inquest to ascertain the circumstances under which Gathiya met his death.

""For that to happen, we must push people around. It is not in the interest of the government to cover up for anyone. All those to be found in the wrong, including our uniformed officers, must carry the cross of justice,"" Mr Nkanatha says.

And for the liquor seller who 'sent Gathaiya to his death', the incident will haunt him forever. Mr Kimani says he received the news of the attack and his subsequent death with a heavy heart.

""I sincerely did not know the order came from an addict discharged from a rehabilitation centre. If I had known, I would not have initiated the delivery. I feel sorry and guilty. My conscience has been tasked to the limit,"" he says.

Mr Kimani adds he is ready to cooperate with investigations in pursuit of justice for Gathaiya.

""He was that kind of a man that you could not quarrel with. He was courteous and to imagine he died so violently breaks my spirit,"" he says.

""Gathaiya took the parcel and set off at around 6.30pm,"" Mr Kiriinya recounts in an interview with Nation.Africa.

The owner of Edwinpark Liquor Store, Mr Moses Kimani, confirmed he sent Gathaiya to deliver the parcel.

Make online payment

""Residents of Thika Greens often place phone orders and make payments online. They give their addresses and I send motorcycle riders to make the deliveries,"" Mr Kimani explains.

""I offered Gathaiya the opportunity to deliver the parcel and earn the Sh50 since it was near where he stayed,” he told the Nation.

But it would turn out to be a deadly assignment. The young man who had placed the order was a recovering addict. He had just been discharged from a rehabilitation centre after battling addiction.

Gathaiya is reported to have walked into the compound carrying the liquor where he met the recovering addict's mother.

Liquor store

According to witnesses, he handed over the parcel to the woman and told her that it was from the liquor store before hell broke loose.

""The woman, upon unwrapping the parcel, found that it was alcohol. She screamed and drew the attention of the security guards manning the entry of the gated community estate,"" says a guard at the estate who sought anonymity.

The guard told Nation.Africa that the young man’s mother ordered the guards to discipline Gathaiya.

""The bitter woman participated in the beating of Gathaiya while screaming that she had spent a fortune treating her son,"" the guard said.

He claims they were paid to discipline Gathaiya who was known to them. He also alleges that he called the family that was hosting Gathaiya when he realised that things  were getting out of hand.

Ms Joyce Ndirangu explains she took Gathaiya in 2018.

""He (Gathaiya) told me he was an orphan from Nakuru who was facing rejection from his relatives. I took him in as a farm help. He was a disciplined, peaceful and religious man,"" Ms Ndirangu says.

She says she received a distressing call, asking her to hurry up to the Nyumba ya Mzungu location as Gathaiya was in trouble and sent her son to find out what was happening.

""My son called me moments later to inform me the guards were very hostile and that Gathaiya was in dire need of help,"" she recalls.

Her son said he watched helplessly from a distance as the beatings continued. The angry woman, according to him, was cursing all those people who expose people's children to substance abuse.

After the beating, the guard claims, his colleagues bundled their victim in the woman’s car and dumped him on a nearby road.

""Gathaiya was so weak and he fell headfirst on the road,"" the guard says.

What happened next to the injured Gathaiya is unclear because of conflicting accounts. Some reports allege he was deliberately run over by a car.

However, the woman at the centre of the incident says she heard he was hit by a vehicle. The woman, whom we cannot name for legal reasons, claims police told her the victim died in a road accident.

""He was disciplined at my place for illegally peddling alcohol in my compound. He was let to go and I hear he was hit by a vehicle,"" she insists.

She adds that ""you should identify with the pain of losing a son to those selling poison and they dare bring it to him while he is fresh from rehab.”



Cause of death

A police vehicle took the body to General Kago Mortuary where the drama continued amid accusations of an attempt to cover up the cause of death.

Mr Kennedy Kimathi, who introduced himself as Gathaiya's friend, says he went to the mortuary to identify the body.

""I found that police had ordered that no one should be allowed to view the body unless in the company of officers or with a court order,"" Mr Kimathi says.

""A female officer kept vigil in the mortuary and at one time declared that Gathaiya should be buried as soon as possible. The officer said she was willing to foot the bill for Gathaiya's burial so as ‘to put the incident behind us,”’ he claims.

Pathologist John Mathaiya, who performed a postmortem examination on Gathaiya’s body on May 2, says his findings were classified by security as confidential.

""As such, the findings can only be availed in a judicial process and not to members of the public,"" Mr Mathaiya says.

According to an investigation report by Gatanga sub-county police the Nation.Africa confidentially saw, ""Gathaiya, who has since been buried in Nakuru County, died in a road accident.”

The report does not mention anything to do with the delivery job, assault at the woman’s home and dumping of the body even after Mr Kiriinya and Mr Kimathi offered to record statements about the incident.

Murang'a County Commissioner Joshua Nkanatha says the security committee he chairs has received some information about the incident and he has ordered that a report of the facts be made available to him as soon as possible.

Mr Nkanatha adds, ""Officers have since been dispatched to verify the claims and all available witness statements be recorded. I have also ordered that a copy of the postmortem examination report be made available to us.”

He says the matter urgently requires a public inquest to ascertain the circumstances under which Gathiya met his death.

""For that to happen, we must push people around. It is not in the interest of the government to cover up for anyone. All those to be found in the wrong, including our uniformed officers, must carry the cross of justice,"" Mr Nkanatha says.

And for the liquor seller who 'sent Gathaiya to his death', the incident will haunt him forever. Mr Kimani says he received the news of the attack and his subsequent death with a heavy heart.

""I sincerely did not know the order came from an addict discharged from a rehabilitation centre. If I had known, I would not have initiated the delivery. I feel sorry and guilty. My conscience has been tasked to the limit,"" he says.

Mr Kimani adds he is ready to cooperate with investigations in pursuit of justice for Gathaiya.

""He was that kind of a man that you could not quarrel with. He was courteous and to imagine he died so violently breaks my spirit,"" he says.

More than 300 buried in Papua New Guinea landslide,"Sydney

More than 300 people and over 1,100 houses were buried by a massive landslide that levelled a remote village in northern Papua New Guinea, local media reported on Saturday.

Hundreds are feared dead in the landslide that hit Kaokalam village in Enga Province, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of capital Port Moresby, around 3am on Friday (1900 GMT on Thursday).

The landslide in the Pacific nation north of Australia buried more than 300 people and 1,182 houses, the Papua New Guinea Post Courier said, citing comments from a member of the country's parliament, Aimos Akem. Akem did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment via social media.

More than six villages had been impacted by the landslide in the province's Mulitaka region, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said on Saturday.

""Australia’s High Commission in Port Moresby is in close contact with PNG authorities for further assessments on the extent of the damage and casualties,"" a DFAT spokesperson said in a statement.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported on Saturday that four bodies had been retrieved from the area after emergency teams reached the sparsely populated area, where the death toll is expected to rise.

The landslide has blocked highway access, making helicopters the only way to reach the area, the broadcaster reported.

Social media footage posted by villager Ninga Role showed people clambering over rocks, uprooted trees and mounds of dirt searching for survivors. Women could be heard weeping in the background.

,"The last four weeks have been special for Philip Kipkemoi Bor and his family.

On Thursday, April 25, 2024, Bor, 54, walked out of the Eldoret Prison a free man, escorted by prison wardens and his lawyer.

He had walked behind prison walls, handcuffed, at the age of 18 in 1989, and this had been his home for 35 years, serving in Kamiti, Naivasha, and Eldoret prisons.

Bor had killed his neighbour while suffering from cerebral malaria, and the courts had, on July 7, 1989, found him guilty of the offence of murder committed while mentally unstable.

The late Justice Daniel Aganyanya had found him guilty of killing his neighbour using a blunt object and sent him to Kamiti Maximum Prison, where he would be detained at the pleasure of the President.

His tribulations began on February 26, 1988, in Lessos, Nandi County. According to the prosecution, Bor, who was resting in his bedroom, had accused the deceased of disrupting his sleep by waking him up.

Startled, he woke up and hit him with a blunt object, and he later succumbed to the injuries. This led to his arrest, and eventually, he was imprisoned.

Thirty-five years later, on April 11 this year, he received reprieve through the courts, thanks to the 2010 Constitution and his lawyer Oscar Oduor from the Centre for Legal Support and Inmate Rehabilitation (CELSIR), who put up a spirited fight to get him out of the confines of the prison walls.

Through his lawyer, Mr Bor filed a fresh High Court Criminal Petition last year, convincing Justice Reuben Nyakundi of the High Court in Eldoret that he deserved freedom.

In the petition, which turned out successful, his lawyer challenged the imprisonment of his client, who had been serving indefinitely at the mercy of the presidential power of mercy.

While challenging the sentence, Mr Bor recounted that he was recovering from cerebral malaria for which he had obtained treatment on the fateful day.

Unplanned attack

He recalled he was asleep in his bedroom when a neighbour woke him up, resulting in the unplanned attack.

The lawyer told the court that it was illegal to jail a mentally unfit person. He argued that because of his state of mind at the time of the incident, he couldn't respond adequately to questions from the investigating officers.

It is alleged that during interrogation, he was beaten by investigating officers who accused him of refusing to respond to their questions and had to seek medical attention at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret for injuries sustained. He was arraigned in court for a plea on March 3, 1988.

In 1991, with his father’s assistance, he embarked on the journey to obtain his file at Eldoret and Nakuru Court registries to appeal, but to no avail.

His attempt to petition for release by the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee over the years had failed.

On April 19, Justice Nyakundi issued his release order, but it wasn't until April 22, when Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) released a psychiatrist report confirming that he was mentally fit, that he walked out of the Eldoret Prisons gate a free man on April 25.

His first stop was at a men’s fashion shop in Eldoret Town, where he acquired a new dirty green suit and brand-new brown leather shoes, courtesy of CELSIR.

We caught up with him at his lawyer’s office at Meadows Building, Off Elgeyo Road, where he had gone to thank his lawyer, Oduor, and the entire staff of CELSIR.

He thanked his lawyers for their commitment that enabled him to get freedom.

Mr Bor said the 35 years he spent in jail was an opportunity for him ""to learn the hard way.""

Despite the challenges in prison, he was ready to face the future. He said that he was ""born again"" during his stay there.

“The far that I have reached is because of God and as I start a new journey in life, I will dedicate my life to serve God as his minister to declare His goodness to the world as a living testimony,” said Mr Bor.

His lawyer said the court agreed with his client that the impugned provisions of Section 166 of the CPC breached the doctrine of separation of powers.

Guilty but insane

“The court also agreed that a finding of guilty but insane is ironic as the fact that he is insane would mean that he cannot understand the charge sufficiently to answer it. It follows that putting such a person through a hearing is a breach of his constitutional rights. Furthermore, Mr Bor’s actions in 1988 were not only unintended but also unforeseen,” said Mr Oduor.

In his judgment, Justice Nyakundi ruled that the appropriate reliefs sought in the petition were meritorious to be granted by the court under Article 23 of the Constitution in favour of the petitioner.

“The review of the conviction of guilty but insane be made and the said conviction be replaced with a finding of not guilty for reason of insanity,” he ruled.

Justice Nyakundi noted that the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (POMAC) failed to take advantage of its constitutional mandate to alleviate Mr Bor’s suffering and ordered and set aside his detention.

“Under Section 12 of the Penal Code, an accused person cannot be held criminally responsible for his acts if it is established that he did not know what he was doing or that he was incapable of understanding that he ought not to do the act,” the Judge stated.

In his early days in prison, the court heard that he was severely sick, and prison management referred him to Kenyatta National Hospital, where he received medical attention for one year. He was discharged from the hospital between August and September 1990.

During his imprisonment, he served at Kamiti Prison from 1989 to 2009, Nyeri Main Prison from 2009 to 2010, and Eldoret Main Prison from 2010 to April 25, 2024.

Back at his home in Cheptel village, Kapsoit ward, Kericho County, it was tears of joy as family, relatives, and villagers gathered to welcome him back home. The firstborn in a family of six was in disbelief and could not control the tears that rolled freely down his cheeks.

Did not hide her joy

His mother, Grace Misik, 72, did not hide her joy after receiving her son, who had been in prison since 1988.

“I lack words to express my gratitude to God. I just say thank you, God, thank you, God,” she said.

Despite the long time that her son spent in prison, she revealed that she did not give up praying for him and kept hope alive that what happened to the biblical Paul and Cyrus would one day happen to him.

Her determination and hope in God for her son’s release was demonstrated in her frequent visits to see him in prison.

“We visited him at least three times a year just to show him we valued him as our son,” said Misik.

His brother, Musa Bor, said: “Throughout we have been hopeful that one day Bor will come home and take over his mantle as the eldest child,” an elated Musa said.

“As Kalenjins, one cannot assume the role of an elder brother if the elder brother is alive. I was only acting but now I am relieved since the real head of this family has come back,” he said.

His sister, Alice Cherono, said prayer and fasting were part of the family menu, with the hope of seeing Bor back home.

Similar sentiments were shared by Bor’s neighbours led by Samuel Langat, who described him as a polite man.

“Growing up together, Bor was just a good man. Whatever happened caught us by surprise. That is why we have been hoping that one day he will be a free man just the way it is today,” said Mr Langat.

Back home, Bor plans to marry soon as he settles down and raises a family.

For his reintegration into the community, however, elaborate traditions have had to be conducted in line with the Kalenjin beliefs. The rituals are to cleanse him in line with the Kipsigis customs.

""Before we help him get married, we have to perform some rituals to cleanse him even as we plan to construct him a house,"" his friend Langat said.

His friend has been tasked with finding a wife.

His father had long died by the time of his release, and he had to undergo certain rites before visiting his grave.

Mr Langat explained that the cleansing was to keep away demonic forces associated with the spirit of murder, which resulted in his imprisonment.

“I haven’t given up in life. I hope to marry shortly and continue serving God together with my wife,” an elated Bor told Nation.Africa's team at his home in Kericho on Monday.

To help him reintegrate into society, CELSIR, which facilitated his release from prison by catering for his legal services, conducted a social bonding session to counsel him on some basic social reintegration expectations he would encounter after prison.

They also gave him an exit care package comprising some household stuff and money to start his life with.

“We will be following up with him to ensure that he settles down in the community where he came from and to encourage him to live a law-abiding and self-sustaining life. This is one of the great achievements of our organization,” said CELSIR Founder and Executive Director Anne Munyua, promising that her institution will work with him to ensure that he successfully settles in the community and starts a fresh life after 35 years behind bars.

For his reintegration into the community, however, elaborate traditions have had to be conducted in line with the Kalenjin beliefs. The rituals are to cleanse him in line with the Kipsigis customs.

""Before we help him get married, we have to perform some rituals to cleanse him even as we plan to construct him a house,"" his friend Langat said.

His friend has been tasked with finding a wife.

His father had long died by the time of his release, and he had to undergo certain rites before visiting his grave.

Mr Langat explained that the cleansing was to keep away demonic forces associated with the spirit of murder, which resulted in his imprisonment.

“I haven’t given up in life. I hope to marry shortly and continue serving God together with my wife,” an elated Bor told Nation.Africa's team at his home in Kericho on Monday.

To help him reintegrate into society, CELSIR, which facilitated his release from prison by catering for his legal services, conducted a social bonding session to counsel him on some basic social reintegration expectations he would encounter after prison.

They also gave him an exit care package comprising some household stuff and money to start his life with.

“We will be following up with him to ensure that he settles down in the community where he came from and to encourage him to live a law-abiding and self-sustaining life. This is one of the great achievements of our organization,” said CELSIR Founder and Executive Director Anne Munyua, promising that her institution will work with him to ensure that he successfully settles in the community and starts a fresh life after 35 years behind bars.

"Israel's Netanyahu to address US Congress soon, says Speaker Johnson","WASHINGTON, May 23 - Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would soon address a joint meeting of Congress amid heightened tension with President Joe Biden over the Israeli leader's handling of the war in Gaza.

Delivering a keynote speech at the Israeli embassy's annual Independence Day reception, Johnson, the top congressional Republican and a critic of the Democratic president’s Israel policy, said it would be “a strong show of support for the Israeli government in their time of greatest need.”

Such a speech is sure to further anger progressive Democrats critical of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and Biden's support for it. Netanyahu has closely aligned himself with Republicans.

The diplomatic gathering in Washington comes amid strains between Biden and Netanyahu over a US push for Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians in the war against Hamas militants in Gaza.

The embassy gave equal billing to Democratic US Representative Pete Aguilar, who shared the high-profile platform with Johnson at a more subdued event under the shadow of the Gaza war. ""As Americans, we reaffirm our commitment to Israel's sovereignty,"" he said.

Speaking first, Johnson said to applause: ""Tonight I'm happy to announce ... we will soon be hosting Prime Minister Netanyahu at the Capitol for a joint session of Congress.""

Successive US administrations have usually sent a high-level official to the Independence Day receptions.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who in recent months has called the situation in Gaza a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and has urged a ceasefire, delivered last year's keynote, mostly extolling U.S. backing for Israel.

An Israeli official said this year the embassy wanted to honour lawmakers in a bipartisan way in appreciation for congressional approval of billions of dollars in new US military aid.

The reception took place on the same night as a White House state dinner for Kenyan President William Ruto, which the Israeli official said created a scheduling conflict for cabinet members.

Several less senior Biden aides were in attendance, including Derek Chollet, Secretary of State Antony Blinken's counsellor.

The White House declined to comment when asked whether it was consulted about the invitation to Netanyahu or whether Biden, who has denied an Oval Office meeting with the Israeli leader, might see him in Washington.

JOHNSON'S VEILED SWIPE AT BIDEN

Johnson and Aguilar both condemned the International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision this week to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence chief, Yoav Gallant. The prosecutor also asked for warrants to capture Hamas leaders responsible for the deadly Oct. 7 cross-border attack on Israel, which triggered the Gaza war.

Johnson took a veiled swipe at Biden, saying ""some leaders"" have sought to withhold ""vital weapons"" from Israel. Biden has paused one shipment of bombs and warned he could delay others if Netanyahu carries out an all-out ground offensive in the refugee-packed city of Rafah in southern Gaza. But the flow of weapons has mostly continued.

Security was tight around the National Building Museum where the reception was held. A small group of pro-Palestinian protesters shouted ""shame on you"" at guests exiting the event. One person held an Israeli flag stained red to simulate blood. Another on a megaphone accused Israel of war crimes.

On Tuesday, Johnson said he was close to inviting Netanyahu, a right-wing leader who had warm relations with former President Donald Trump.

Johnson, a Trump ally, had issued Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer an ultimatum to sign a letter inviting Netanyahu or else he would only speak to the House of Representatives.

Schumer had signalled he was open to Congress hosting Netanyahu, despite declaring in March that the Israeli leader had “lost his way” and calling for new elections in Israel.

Johnson did not specify a date for Netanyahu's speech.

Addresses to Congress are a rare honour generally reserved for the closest US allies.

Netanyahu has already given three speeches, most recently in 2015. That year, Republican leaders invited him without consulting Democratic then-President Barack Obama, as Netanyahu joined them in an unsuccessful bid to derail Obama's international nuclear deal with Iran.

Dozens of Democrats boycotted Netanyahu's last speech, raising the prospect that some could stay away this time.

Johnson, struggling to keep his fractious Republican House majority intact, has been a prominent voice in the U.S. political divide over Israeli policy. The politicisation of the issue has intensified ahead of the November election in which Biden is running against Trump.

In contrast to past years’ gala celebrations, this year’s reception, marking the 76th anniversary of Israel’s founding, was billed as a “solidarity event.”

Israel is fighting to wipe out Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

"Shock as missing woman found raped, murdered under neighbour's bed in Embu","Residents are in shock after a woman who had been missing for three days was found raped and brutally murdered in the sprawling village of Riangiri in Embu County.

Surprisingly, the decomposing body of the deceased, identified as Lilian Nkatha, 35, was found hidden under the bed in a neighbour's house.

Nkatha had injuries on her head, neck and left hand, a clear indication that she had been brutally murdered.

A casual labourer who was last seen with the deceased is now the prime suspect in the gruesome murder of the married woman with two children.

The man who owns the house has gone into hiding and detectives are looking for him for questioning.

According to the family and residents, the deceased disappeared around 11am on Sunday when she was last seen alive.

The family said Nkatha was called by the labourer in the neighbourhood and they went together, but the family became suspicious that something was wrong when the deceased did not return home in the evening.

On Monday, the family and residents began a thorough search of the farms and bushes for the deceased, but they did not find her.

Resumed the search

On Tuesday, the family and locals resumed the search and when they did not find the deceased, they reported the matter to the police for investigation.

On Wednesday, however, the family became concerned when they saw flies hovering over the neighbour's house and a foul smell emanating from it.

They reported the matter to the police, after which detectives went to the scene and broke into the house, which was locked from the inside, only to find the deceased lying in a pool of blood under the suspect's bed.

""When we learnt of our daughter's mysterious disappearance, we searched everywhere for her without success and then informed the police and took statements,"" said Rose Makena, Nkatha's sister.

Fell on deaf ears

Ms Makena narrated how their pleas to a local administrator to help them search for the deceased fell on deaf ears.

""When we told the administrator that our daughter was missing and we wanted his help, he ignored us,"" said Ms Makena.

The family said Nkatha called her husband Peter Muriithi, who works in Meru, on the suspect's mobile phone on Sunday morning and they spoke.

Nkatha asked her husband to send her money to buy food and he agreed.

But when Muriithi later called his wife on Monday to find out how she was, he could not reach her because the suspect's phone had been switched off.

Sensing danger, he rushed home and was shocked to find his wife missing and joined residents in the search.

""Sadly, my wife's lifeless body was found in the house where the suspect was staying,"" lamented Mr Muriithi.

The family wants to know the motive behind such a cruel act that has left everyone baffled.

They are also calling on the police to ensure that the suspect is tracked down and brought to book.

Crying for justice

""We are now crying for justice, our daughter's life has been lost and the person responsible should be punished according to the rule of law,' said Mrs Makena.

According to other reports, Nkatha was seen having drinks with the suspect at a local bar before she was reported missing.

Detectives have assured the family and residents that no stone will be left unturned.

""We are appealing to the family and locals to be patient and wait for the conclusion of investigations,"" said one of the detectives, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to brief the media on crime matters.

Detectives said the matter was being treated as a murder and the suspect would be charged with a capital offence once arrested and investigations complete.

They appealed to residents for any information that could help in the swift arrest of the suspect, who is well-known in the area.

Earlier, angry residents tried to demolish the neighbour's house in protest but were stopped by police.

Tribulations of experienced teachers employed by TSC as JSS interns,"In 2015, Edna Kamuren from Tenges in Baringo Central left her work as a laboratory technician at Kabarnet Boys High School and enrolled for a Bachelor of Education in Arts at Kisii University.

The motivation behind the decision was to improve her life and that of her three children.

The 40-year-old had earlier graduated with a Diploma from the Eldoret Polytechnic, where she pursued Analytical Chemistry, a course that earned her employment at Kabarnet Boys High School for more than 13 years.

She joined Kisii University, where she studied Kiswahili and Christian Religious Education.

“I was very optimistic that my future would be bright by changing my career, from a laboratory technician to a secondary school tutor, but I didn’t quit my work,” she tells Nation.Africa.

She would report to the school during the day and attend classes in the evening. The salary would go to her school fees, but it was not easy though, she says.

“With all the struggles of work, school, and taking care of my three children, I managed to graduate in 2018,” she says.

Read: TSC to renew contracts for 46,000 interns in January

She continued working as a technician after she applied for jobs at several schools without success until 2022 when the government announced opportunities for junior secondary school teachers, and she gave it a shot. She was elated this would change her life for the better if she got enlisted, she reveals.

Despite applying for employment on permanent and pensionable terms, she received feedback that she had been employed as an intern JSS teacher, which took her aback since some fresh graduates were employed on permanent terms.

She, however, was comforted by the employment letter, which indicated that she would be confirmed after a year.

The year would soon be over, only for the government to fail to honour its promise, meaning she and others in her fate would continue working on internship terms.

She now regrets quitting her well-paying job as a lab technician to pursue teaching.

“The Sh17,000 monthly earnings are inadequate to cater to my needs and my children,"" said Ms Kamuren, who has since withdrawn her three children from a private school for a public school.

Like many other JSS teachers in her shoes, she wonders what criteria were applied to employ recent graduates on Permanent and pensionable terms while denying the experienced teachers the same.

“I am so discouraged because I was looking for ‘greener pasture’ as a secondary school teacher after quitting my job as a lab technician. I had big dreams for my children, and had so much hope in my employer, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), to give me a bright future,” she says.

She had to secure a loan to pay school fees, now deducted from her meagre earnings.

“As a lab technician, I earned more. But I wanted a better future, and I felt I needed to go back to school. I am appealing to the government to just honour its promise and confirm us on permanent employment because we are suffering,” she said.

She reveals that due to the shortage of teachers, some have to teach subjects they never studied in university, implying a workload for the underpaid intern teachers.

Specialised in CRE and Kiswahili

“Though I specialised in CRE and Kiswahili, I teach other subjects that I never studied at the university because of a shortage of teachers. It is very unfair because the workload and roles are shared equally with those on PnP,” she says.

It is the reason intern teachers have been staging protests in the country demanding confirmation on PnP terms.

Joan Toroitich from Karne in Baringo, a mother of two, graduated in 2016 after pursuing a Bachelor of Arts at Mount Kenya University.

She has resorted to doing menial jobs during weekends to make ends meet.

Like Ms Kamuren, she struggled to complete her university education, having come from a humble background.

At some point, she deferred her studies due to school fees challenges. Besides her two children, she has younger siblings looking up to her, all depending on her paltry Sh17,000.

She spends more than Sh250 daily on her bus fare to school, hence her decision to supplement her income through menial work over the weekends.

Read: Why problems in junior secondary are far from over

“Most of those who were employed graduated from the university recently. Why didn’t they consider us who graduated earlier? What criteria was used to employ us as interns because this is very unfair,” she told Nation.Africa.

She, too, points at the understaffing challenge that has presented a heavy workload on JSS teachers, regardless of their employment terms.

“We have two classes, and one has 40 lessons per week, meaning I have eight lessons per day. There is no time to rest, we work from morning to evening,” she states. I am supposed to teach English and Literature, but I have to take other subjects too, which I didn’t study in university because there is a shortage of teachers,” she notes.

“Such a workload and so little pay is very demoralising,” she states.

During protests in Kabarnet Town last week, JSS intern teacher Nicholas Keror took issue with TSC’s argument that the internship programme was meant to equip them with skills and experience.

“What experience do they want us to have when some of us here graduated in 2015 and have been teaching since then in several schools under the Board of Management? We have served as intern teachers for junior secondary for one and half years and we want the government to honour its promise and employ us on permanent terms. You cannot promise us heaven and deliver hell,” he protested.

Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Baringo branch executive secretary Zacharia Nyomboi said JSS intern teachers have gone through challenges, with some unable to cater to their families.

“What type of internship is this, and yet you have given the same job to someone who graduated a year ago? Where is the fairness here?” posed Nyomboi.

Kuppet has asked the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (KUPPET) to investigate TSC and release a report on how many teachers have been employed in the last two years permanently.

He took issue with Members of Parliament for staying silent on the matter.

“They (legislators) are silent yet they are aware that JSS children in public schools are not learning. It is not business as usual unless the government is ready to waste a generation. The government must fund TSC to employ JSS teachers on permanent and pensionable terms,” added Nyomboi.

We have served as intern teachers for junior secondary for one and half years and we want the government to honour its promise and employ us on permanent terms. You cannot promise us heaven and deliver hell,” he protested.

Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Baringo branch executive secretary Zacharia Nyomboi said JSS intern teachers have gone through challenges, with some unable to cater to their families.

“What type of internship is this, and yet you have given the same job to someone who graduated a year ago? Where is the fairness here?” posed Nyomboi.

Kuppet has asked the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (KUPPET) to investigate TSC and release a report on how many teachers have been employed in the last two years permanently.

He took issue with Members of Parliament for staying silent on the matter.

“They (legislators) are silent yet they are aware that JSS children in public schools are not learning. It is not business as usual unless the government is ready to waste a generation. The government must fund TSC to employ JSS teachers on permanent and pensionable terms,” added Nyomboi.

Court throws out appeal of sex pest who was jailed for 330 years,"In 2021, David Karega Njau was sentenced to 330 years in prison for defiling five school girls aged between three and six years.

Believing the punishment to be excessive, he decided to appeal.

However, the High Court on May 21 upheld the sentence, deeming it commensurate with the severity of his offenses.

Court documents revealed that Karega would waylay the girls as they returned from school, luring them to his house with money or sweets.

Once there, he gave them alcohol before defiling them in turns. The crimes occurred in Nakuru’s Rigogo village in Rongai Sub-county between September 10 and September 19, 2019.

Karega threatened the girls with death if they disclosed what had happened.

The terrified children initially kept silent. However, one girl confided in her grandmother after the pain became unbearable. The grandmother notified a neighbour, who in turn contacted the police, leading to Karega's arrest.

The girls’ parents discovered the abuse after their children complained of pain while urinating and bathing.

In court, one girl described how Karega hid in a maize plantation, gave them money, and took them to his house.

She said he made them lie on a couch, gave them alcohol, and forced them to drink from a bottle he had urinated in.

He would then cover their mouths to prevent them from screaming and then defiled them one by one. The girl, who lived with her grandmother, disclosed the abuse after enduring two consecutive days of defilement.

Medical examinations by Dr Njoroge Luka confirmed that three of the girls had been defiled, while there were attempts on two others.

In his defence, Karega claimed he was at his grandmother’s burial at the time and alleged that the children’s parents had framed him due to personal grudges and unpaid debts.

Principal Magistrate Rhoda Yator, in her ruling delivered on March2, 2021, found Karega guilty and sentenced him to 100 years imprisonment for each of the three counts of defilement and 10 years for each of the three counts of committing an indecent act with a child.

Karega filed an appeal on March 10 complaining that the punishment was harsh and severe and failed to take into account the age and the circumstances surrounding the offence.

But on May 21, Nakuru High Court judge Samuel Mohochi dismissed Karega’s appeal and found the deterrent punishment commensurate with the magnitude of the offense.

“The appellant subjected the five minors all under the age of seven years to a bizarre and inhuman sexual attack. The orgy of sexual violence and threats of physical harm against the five children resulted in serious permanent trauma scars for which they shall remain, for the rest of their lives. In this case justice can only be served by a deterrent imprisonment term,” Justice Mohochi ruled. The sentences will, however, run concurrently.","By

Fai Amario estate dispute: 'Son' surfaces following newspaper wife search Ad,"The inheritance battle over the Sh760 million estate of the late controversial Naivasha-based brewer, Fai Amario, has taken a new twist after a man claiming to be his son moved to court seeking to be included as a beneficiary.

Mr Evans Karee, 33, alleges that he is the biological son of the late businessman and has filed an application in court seeking what he believes is his rightful inheritance.

Mr Karee stated that his late father was polygamous and had married his deceased mother, Penninah Shinta, after placing an advertisement in the local dailies searching for a wife.

This development comes just four months after the 14-year succession dispute appeared to be headed for a conclusion.

On January 31, Nakuru High Court judge, Samuel Mohochi, distributed part of the estate worth Sh56 million among 10 beneficiaries and allowed the administrators to confirm the remaining estate based on consent signed by nine beneficiaries.

The 10 beneficiaries included Amario's children Marsha Dee, Miki Ng’ang’a, Bernice Njeri, Debbie Jolly, James Kimani, Sheena Euston, Yuri Gilbert, Sheila Wangari, a minor, and Salome Wanjiku.

Ms Wanjiku, who was a girlfriend to the tycoon, was allocated 5 percent of the Sh56 million.

But Mr Karee is seeking the revocation of the grant of letters of administration issued to Amario's children Dee, Ng'ang’a, and Euston, on September 23, 2010.

He claims these administrators excluded him by deliberately concealing material facts about his existence, and he only discovered the case had been filed later in January.

He presented the court with a newspaper report proving that Amario married Shinta in Nakuru on September 11, 1999. He further alleges that his step-siblings were aware of his existence, but chose to conceal it from the courts when they filed the case in 2010.

“The administrators are aware I exist. They knew my mother. They never informed me of the proceedings and the case was filed in 2010, while I was still in High School,” stated Mr Karee in his court papers.

He now wants the court to stop the distribution of the estate until his application, in which he seeks to be recognised as a family member, is heard and determined.

“The planned distribution of the estate will be prejudicial to me since it will disinherit me from my rightful dues, thus violating my rights,” he said.

Justice Mohochi directed Mr Karee to serve the application within seven days, which should be replied to within 14 days, before giving further directions on July 9.

Fai Amario, a wealthy tycoon who died in 2010, was among the first major suppliers of affordable liquor and founded one of the indigenous alcohol distillers, Fai Amarillo Ltd.

His life was marked by controversy and frequent clashes with authorities.

Popular brands produced by his factory included Amario’s Sherry, Pooler, Medusa, Uhuru 2000, Kata Pingu, Mahewa, and Cantata, which were distributed via depots in Meru, Murang’a, Thika, and Naivasha.

In 2021, Ms Dee informed the court that the company generated Sh28 million every four months.

The estate's distribution has been contentious, with Mr Ng’ang’a and Ms Dee disputing over beneficiaries. While Ng’ang’a wanted all 10 to benefit, Dee sought to exclude Wanjiku and Wangari, arguing they were not rightful beneficiaries.

According to the consent signed in court, Ng’ang’a, Dee, Njeri, Jolly, Kimani, Euston, and Yuri were each allocated 11.85 percent of the estate, the minor 6.05 percent, Wanjiku 5 percent, and Wangari 6 percent.

The family proposed selling the properties located in Mwichiringiri, Naivasha, for Sh56 million.

Turkana hit by spike in donkey thefts amid illegal skin trade,"The Turkana County government is moving to register donkeys and regulate their movement as villages are reporting an increase in livestock theft.

Far-flung villages with limited security presence have been identified by donkey owners as targets of the illegal donkey skin trade.

This situation in villages in Loima, Turkana West, Lokichoggio, Turkana Central and Turkana North sub-counties is contributing to the dwindling donkey population, residents say.

The situation has now attracted the attention of authorities who have announced plans to implement new laws aimed at protecting donkeys from abuse and exploitation.

A donkey owner, Emmanuel Kisike claimed that since the establishment of a donkey slaughterhouse in 2017 in Turkana County, there have been increased cases of donkey theft because of their skin and not meat.

Read: Four arrested in Kirinyaga while ferrying donkey meat to Nairobi

“I lost seven donkeys at Lokiriama village in 2018. The thieves just took the skin from three of the animals and left the meat,” Mr Kisike said.

The situation was even widespread in major towns such as Lodwar after some locals were recruited as dealers in return for quick cash, he claimed.

“We fear that the donkeys may become extinct if such illegal dealings are not stopped. Thieves who don’t even rear a single goat brazenly steal and sell donkeys at throwaway prices,” Mr Kisike told Nation.africa,

There is a proposed legislation that will mandate proper identification and registration of donkeys, regulate their movement, and impose heavy penalties on those caught engaging in illegal trade or mistreatment of the animals.

Assistant County Commissioner from Turkana Central Sub County Michael Kiguta stated that the stock theft has caused a significant decline in the donkey population.

“I appeal to the management of the donkey slaughterhouses to resist involvement in underhand deals and ensure that for any donkey they buy legitimately belongs to an owner bearing clearance from the area chief and follow up call made as a proof,” Mr Kiguta said.

Read: 10 arrested while ferrying donkey meat to Nairobi

The Agency for Cross-Border Pastoralists Development executive director Samson Kimeli says the illegal donkey trade is driven by demand for donkey hides used in Chinese traditional medicines.

Mr Kimeli added that research by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization revealed that the animals face extinction because the existing donkey population cannot sustain the business of the four slaughterhouses.

“We are creating awareness of the need to protect donkey during meetings with donkey owners, authorities, and local leaders. We also support animal health check-ups, treatment, and educational sessions on how to properly care for donkeys,” he said.

Mr Julius Ekalale, a resident said that the current population of donkeys in the county is low due to the beast of burden’s long gestation period of 12 months.

Another farmer Maxmillah Akai said women in remote areas rely on donkeys to fetch water and carry food items from the market.

“We need support from the government to stop commercialisation of the donkey trade as it is negatively affecting our way of life,” Ms Akai said.

Kaptembwa families affected by floods receive aid,"More than 6,000 flood victims in the South Rift are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, Head of Red Cross in the region Felix Maiyo has said.

Mr Maiyo stated that the hardest hit are more than 2,000 people in Baringo County who are also affected by insecurity.

“The rains are subsiding but many of the victims, particularly those in Baringo County who were first displaced by insecurity, are still suffering. I urge well-wishers to come and assist them. Some of the children are yet to report back to school as their school items like books and uniforms, as well as the institutions, were destroyed by floods,” said Mr Maiyo.

He spoke at Kaptembwa slums in Nakuru City where he led his team to distribute foodstuffs donated by the Sarova Woodlands Hotel and Spa and Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge staff to more than 1,500 victims. The informal settlements are home to more than 100,000 residents.

While the assistance did not reach all those in need, Mr Maiyo said that the Red Cross was engaging well-wishers to enable them to offer more help.

“We have been able to get assistance for only 300 families and I thank Sarova Hotels and Resorts Kenya for responding to our call to help the affected families,” said Mr Maiyo.

Support

Cluster General Manager in charge of Sarova Woodlands Hotel and Spa and Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge Duncan Mwangi assured the residents of support.

“Sarova Hotels and Resorts cares for all Kenyans in dire need, including those affected by floods,” said Mr Mwangi.

Nakuru West sub-county assistant county commissioner Sharon Chelagat urged residents whose houses collapsed after the floods not to return to their homes until government geologists complete investigations into the deep fissures near their houses.

The government has deployed senior geologists to Nakuru for more detailed studies after the floods left massive fissures in Kaptembwa area. Most of the houses that collapsed were built near sand quarries.

,"In 1996, a respected elder living in Dabel, Marsabit County, prophesied that precious minerals would be discovered in the area. But just how big a blessing and later, a curse it was to become, was not clear to any of the dismissive residents he told.

While the old man died a few months later in 1996, the prophecy came to pass in 2018 when a herder found gold nuggets and sold them, kicking off a mad gold rush in the village located 64 kilometres west of Moyale town at the Kenya-Ethiopia border.

“We vividly remember how one of our elders and a seer prophesied about gold discovery, but we did not take him seriously at the time. After the discovery, we expected to reap big from it,” says Sakuye community secretary Hajj Hassan Tepo.

But the discovery of the precious mineral turned into a curse.

In March this year, eleven people—all said to be Ethiopians—were killed in a clash over how to share the resources. This was after members of two warring communities stumbled on huge deposits inside the mines and failed to agree on how to share them.

Read: Experts want laws to control mining deals

Sakuye community vice secretary Mohammed Ali Wario detailed how two rival groups of miners dug tunnels and bumped into each other and began a scrambling for gold that exploded into ethnic conflict.

Fight erupted

“They were digging from the opposite sides and met where the deposits were. When they disagreed and fought inside the mine, a vicious fight erupted among members of their communities outside,” said Mr Wario.

The government, through a Gazette notice published by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on March 13, shut down the 13 mines spread over an area of about 50 square kilometres and deployed the military to guard the area.

The mining sites are Hillo Gorgora, Hillo Orofa, Hillo Walkite, Hillo Tanzania, Hillo Irress Abamartille, Hillo Gootu, Hillo Tessum Qalicha, Hillo Karray, Hillo Hudda, Hillo QQoranjido, Shindia, Hillo Rabaalee, and Hillo Godde Haroressa.

Before the indefinite closure of the fields, miners reportedly reaped millions of shillings. There was a massive influx of miners and investors from other parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia. Dabel became a sort of shanty town teeming with more than 70,000 people drawn from several countries.

According to the miners we interviewed in Moyale, a lot of gold was mined each month.

“Gold mining is a highly secretive business and nobody would disclose how much they made. But going by the kind of business that was going on in Moyale town and the tycoons who drove all the way from Nairobi, traders raked in millions of shillings a day,” said Mr Abubakar Hassan, a resident.

After the closure, the miners said, their lives have been turned upside down with equipment and ore valued at over Sh500 million lying at the sites. They complained that they were not allowed to access or service their machines amid claims some people were still being allowed into the mines and cart away ore.

100 investors

Mr Wote Gayo, who moved into the mines in July last year and employed about 50 people, said he owned a crasher that was still at the site, and was worried that the equipment was being used by other people.

He added that with more than 100 investors like him, they estimated the property held up at the site is worth over Sh500 million.

“My crusher and other investments are worth more than Sh3 million and I am worried they are being misused. It is now two months since the mines were shut and we have not even been allowed to go and service our machines,” Mr Gayo said.

“The warring communities have since resolved their differences and we want the government to reopen the mines, not only for a select few, but for all of us. This is because we fear continued closure could result in further conflict as people try to access the mines by force,” he added.

Moyale Council of Elders Chairperson Shakur Ibrahim claimed that some rogue security officials colluded with businessmen to collect cart away ore and sold it secretly. He added that the ban should not only apply to the common man yet the rich continue to benefit.

“We thank the government for moving with speed and closing the mines when the fight erupted. But at the moment, continued closure is not serving any purpose because the mines are open for the rich who are refining the ore in Moyale and exploiting our resources,” he said.

However, Prof Kindiki reiterated that the mines would not be reopened, and hinted at extension of the closure notice.

“We want all regulations put in place to ensure that there is adequate security so that when the mines are reopened, residents of the area benefit and not a few people. We shut the mines because they had been infiltrated by criminal elements,” Prof Kindiki said in Marsabit on May 10.



Even as the mining activities contributed to impressive growth of businesses in Moyale town and lifted many jobless youths and women out of poverty, Mr Hajji Tepo said the local Sakuye community living close to the mines never benefited directly from this boom.



He said most of the revenues were smuggled through Ethiopia to Dubai and other Middle East countries and expressed concern that poverty rates and inequalities in the community were still alarmingly high despite the resources.

Mr Tepo called on the government to allow the mining to reach its full potential and ensure the local communities have a role in making decisions over the resources.

“When the mines are reopened the sharing of royalties should adhere to the law, where the national government gets 70 per cent, county government 20 per cent and the local community 10 per cent,” he said.

March conflict

Mr Wario said proper mechanisms should be put into place to avert a repeat of the March conflict. “The mines should be reopened only after instituting adequate measures to avert congestion, land degradation, use of cyanide and mercury by miners, and proper hygiene measures.”

Last month, Mining Principal Secretary Elijah Mwangi said the government would formalise the sector, with artisanal miners required to register Saccos that will be licensed to carry out mining activities. Artisanal mining committees would be formed in each county to provide guidelines on the licensing procedures, he said.

Hilo Artisanal Miners Cooperative vice secretary Mukhtar Intalo explained that plans were in top gear to register a cooperative, saying they were ready to undertake regulated mining.

“We are putting strategies in place by registering cooperatives that will ensure there is sanity in the mining sector in Dabel before we embark on pushing the State to reopen the mines,” Mr Intalo said, adding that the Sacco has already registered 3,500 members.

Moyale Youths Association Chairman Bona Adan appealed to the government to reopen the mines to allow the over 70,000 people who have now been rendered jobless to find a source of income.

Moyale Maendeleo ya Wanawake Chairperson Asna Hussein said that when the mining was going on, there were cases of gender-based violence, defilement, rape, and moral degradation. “Before the mines are reopened, these issues, including environmental degradation, should be considered and addressed,”” she said.

,"In 1996, a respected elder living in Dabel, Marsabit County, prophesied that precious minerals would be discovered in the area. But just how big a blessing and later, a curse it was to become, was not clear to any of the dismissive residents he told.

While the old man died a few months later in 1996, the prophecy came to pass in 2018 when a herder found gold nuggets and sold them, kicking off a mad gold rush in the village located 64 kilometres west of Moyale town at the Kenya-Ethiopia border.

“We vividly remember how one of our elders and a seer prophesied about gold discovery, but we did not take him seriously at the time. After the discovery, we expected to reap big from it,” says Sakuye community secretary Hajj Hassan Tepo.

But the discovery of the precious mineral turned into a curse.

In March this year, eleven people—all said to be Ethiopians—were killed in a clash over how to share the resources. This was after members of two warring communities stumbled on huge deposits inside the mines and failed to agree on how to share them.

Sakuye community vice secretary Mohammed Ali Wario detailed how two rival groups of miners dug tunnels and bumped into each other and began a scrambling for gold that exploded into ethnic conflict.

Fight erupted

“They were digging from the opposite sides and met where the deposits were. When they disagreed and fought inside the mine, a vicious fight erupted among members of their communities outside,” said Mr Wario.

The government, through a Gazette notice published by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on March 13, shut down the 13 mines spread over an area of about 50 square kilometres and deployed the military to guard the area.

The mining sites are Hillo Gorgora, Hillo Orofa, Hillo Walkite, Hillo Tanzania, Hillo Irress Abamartille, Hillo Gootu, Hillo Tessum Qalicha, Hillo Karray, Hillo Hudda, Hillo QQoranjido, Shindia, Hillo Rabaalee, and Hillo Godde Haroressa.

Before the indefinite closure of the fields, miners reportedly reaped millions of shillings. There was a massive influx of miners and investors from other parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia. Dabel became a sort of shanty town teeming with more than 70,000 people drawn from several countries.

According to the miners we interviewed in Moyale, a lot of gold was mined each month.

“Gold mining is a highly secretive business and nobody would disclose how much they made. But going by the kind of business that was going on in Moyale town and the tycoons who drove all the way from Nairobi, traders raked in millions of shillings a day,” said Mr Abubakar Hassan, a resident.

After the closure, the miners said, their lives have been turned upside down with equipment and ore valued at over Sh500 million lying at the sites. They complained that they were not allowed to access or service their machines amid claims some people were still being allowed into the mines and cart away ore.

100 investors

Mr Wote Gayo, who moved into the mines in July last year and employed about 50 people, said he owned a crasher that was still at the site, and was worried that the equipment was being used by other people.

"‘As a woman, there’s pressure to constantly lead and excel on all fronts’","What's the most prized possession in your office?

I enjoy the view outside my office the most. I find it inspiring and limitless, which resonates with my personality.

My first name means a falcon, whereas Nilofer means a water lily. It's like you fly high, gallop, and fall like thunder in the water.

Your work demands lots of travel to different countries. How have the diverse experiences shaped you as an individual?

It has broadened my worldview significantly. You know, I was born and brought up in a small town in India. And, when you grow up in such an environment, your world is very limited in itself.

Your relationships, your network, your families, and your group of friends. This job has exposed me to different cultures, political systems, and developmental challenges.

All these experiences have made me more understanding and appreciative of diversity.

What’s the toughest part of settling into a new country, especially as a career woman?

I think I've grown into this role, as this is my fourth representative's role, and while I might seem to dive headfirst into new jobs, honestly, it wasn’t always this way.

In my initial career progression, there was extra pressure and the burden to prove a point. You know, I am here, I have arrived.

And I realised that it’s extremely burdensome especially when you are a woman because you are often put under surveillance.

People are going to put you on a test; they want to see how you’re doing, how you’re able to manage the issues, conflicts, and all of that.

But as you grow into roles, you realise that everything has its own time to address it. Over time, throughout these different jurisdictions, I've learned there’s no need to rush in to prove yourself.

In basketball, there’s an interesting saying: “Lead with your offhand.” Whether you’re right or left-handed, it means developing your weaker side to become more well-rounded.

Just like in basketball, as a woman, there’s the pressure to constantly ‘lead’ on all fronts – excelling in every area and being visible everywhere.

And that's an unnecessary pressure that you put on yourself. But later in my career, I didn't necessarily think that was this important.

If you could tell me, drawing from what you've just said, you often travel alone, and your family still lives in India, how do you adjust to new postings, say the one in Kenya, with your family not around?

You know, it has both sides to it. The better part of it is that you go and start your work without having to think about family logistics.

But the downside is you feel very lonely in the initial days, and it takes time to make friends. Work can easily become your whole world.

Thirty years in senior leadership positions is quite a long time. What has helped you to stay in those positions?

When I reflect on my career path, it fills me with immense gratitude. It's been a journey of muddying my boots and soiling my hands, literally.

I value those experiences very much because I understand the ground reality very well, from the development nuances to the interface between politics and development. I have worked in countries like Afghanistan, countries in South Asia, Central Asia and now, in Africa.

I have seen the vast spectrum of developmental challenges across continents. The way the governments run, the geopolitics, the macroeconomics, and the situations there. These experiences have been extremely helpful for me.

What do you love most about Kenya?

I love travelling in this place. And I love the sheer green. This is one very beautiful country.

What career advice would you give to those seeking to climb up the career ladder?

Never give up too early. Because I know as a young professional woman, there are a lot of obligations that you will face. And sometimes it can take you on a guilt trip.

You know, like you are neglecting your family and other responsibilities. I say, embrace it but don’t let it hold you back.

Notably, this applies in many ways to men too. Importantly, take every roadblock as an opportunity to grow, and enjoy what you're doing.

What does tomorrow look like for a child in Kenya, and in any other part of the world?

Primarily, I do see there's a lot of hope and optimism. It is about ensuring that we come together because the time to act is now.

And we just have about barely five to six years before we hit the finishing line to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)2030.

I strongly believe that it is a doable proposition, and Kenya will be able to achieve its commitment to SDGs for children, if we can bring in our collective efforts, both in terms of our resources, ensuring that the fund flow for those commitments, and the budgetary allocations for the children are sustained.

"Biden, Trump agree on the dates of Presidential debate","US President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to face off in two debates on June 27 and September 10, setting up the highest stakes moments yet of the race for the White House.

""As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,"" Biden said on social media.

Trump called Biden ""the worst debater"" he has ever faced.

""I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September,"" he posted on social media.

CNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O, said the first debate would be held in their Atlanta studio with no audience, and would be moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Georgia is one of November's most closely contested states.

The candidates also accepted an invitation from ABC DIS.N, which will host a second debate on September 10.

A separate vice presidential debate has been proposed for July, after the Republican National Convention.

Key differences between the two sides remained on the terms of engagement. Biden said he would participate in those two debates under strict rules to reduce interruptions, while Trump called for more than two - and a very large venue ""for excitement purposes.""

Independent US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr claimed in a new post on X that he will meet the criteria to participate in the CNN debate before the June 20 deadline. It remained unclear if he will qualify.

CNN requires its debate candidates to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold and receive at least 15 per cent in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed only 13 per cent of Americans would vote for Kennedy.

Earlier in the day Kennedy said Biden and Trump "" are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.""

Debates, which will draw a US live television audience in the tens of millions, are fraught with risks for both candidates, who face a tight race and low enthusiasm from voters.

Biden aides think debates could hurt Trump by exposing his positions on issues, including abortion, that they regard as political vulnerabilities.

Trump aides see Biden as prone to verbal slip-ups that could amplify voter concerns about the 81-year-old president's age. Trump will be 78 by the time the first debate is held.

""Both candidates will be under greater scrutiny than they have ever been due to their age,"" Alan Schroeder, a professor emeritus at Northeastern University who wrote the book ""Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trial."" He called the debate ""one of the only moments in which the candidates don't have complete control.""

The first debate would take place after the June 15 conclusion of the Group of Seven summit in Italy and Trump's criminal trial in New York.

Biden's debate proposal, the first formal offer by his campaign, ditched the decades-old tradition of three fall debates and called for direct negotiations between the Trump and Biden campaigns over the rules.

Asked about any preference for format or topics, Biden-Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said some details remained to be worked out.

The move to accept debates shows Biden is willing to take a calculated risk to boost his opinion poll numbers in a race in which he is trailing Trump in key battleground states. In addition to his age, voters remain concerned about Biden's handling of the economy.

Trump, who refused to debate his rivals during the Republican nominating race, has in recent weeks been challenging Biden to a one-on-one matchup with him, arguing that debates should be held before early voting begins in some states.

He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt the debate should be two hours and that both men should be required to stand.

Biden's team earlier requested that only broadcast networks that hosted Republican primary debates in 2016 and Democratic primary debates in 2020 be eligible to host this year.

Only four networks hosted debates for both parties during those election cycles: CNN, Telemundo CMCSA.O, CBS News and ABC News.

The Biden team showed no signs of accepting Trump's invitation for more debates. A Biden campaign spokesperson declined comment on the issue.

Biden said he would not take part in the traditional televised showdowns organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, rejecting the nonpartisan organization that has managed them since 1988.

Trump had also expressed interest in bypassing the commission, and the Republican National Committee announced in 2022 that the party would leave the commission's debate system altogether.

In a letter explaining the Biden campaign's decision, campaign chair Jennifer O'Malley Dillon cited the commission's past struggles to keep candidates from violating debate rules.

She notified the commission that Biden will not be participating in the three general-election debates sponsored by the group, which are scheduled for September 16, October 1 and October 9. The commission could not be reached for a comment.

""The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home — not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors, who consume valuable debate time with noisy spectacles of approval or jeering,"" Dillon said.

Biden's campaign also pressed for a debate that would occur before early voting started and without the participation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or any other independent or third-party candidates.","By

,"The national government has upgraded the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) in Kisumu to a Level 6 facility.

Locals in Kisumu commonly refer to it as 'Russia Hospital', a name coined because of the good relations between Kenya and the Russian government.

The JOOTRH is one of the oldest health facilities in the country, serving thousands of patients in the Western region.

The hospital is located along the Kakamega-Kisumu Highway just before Kondele Police Station on a 55.6 acre land.

The elevation comes after a recent evaluation and inspection conducted by the Kenya Health Professional Oversight Authority (KHPOA).

Kisumu County Government had initially requested the national government to take over the running of the facility due to financial constraints.

According to the JOOTRH administration, the health oversight body awarded the facility a score of 85 per cent after a recent inspection on August 1, 2023.

But what does the upgrading of the public hospital to a Level 6 facility means to local residents?

For starters, with the Ministry of Health taking over the facility, it shall be on the same level with Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), and Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital (KUTRH) which are run by the national government.



Funds

Another advantage the facility is bound to have is the unlocking of funds especially from the national government and other partners, therefore enhancing the quality of services offered to residents.

Currently, 70 per cent of the hospital's resources come from the county government.

The regional referral hospital is serving patients drawn from 10 counties within the Lake Region Economic Bloc.

This has however been a thorn in the flesh of Governor Anyang' Nyong’o's administration since it had to run the Level 5 facility at its own operation cost.



Surgeries and procedures

According to the County Chief Executive Committee Member of Health Dr Gregory Ganda, the upgrading of JOOTRH means that the facility will now be equipped with both professional personnel and medical equipment to conduct high-level surgeries and save residents the agony of having to travel far to undergo such medical procedures.

Currently, the facility has 11 functional operational theatres, including general, Accident & Emergency, and three dedicated maternity theatres.



Service Delivery

The upgrade is expected to improve medical service delivery. For instance, the creation of consultation rooms to promote patients' privacy.

With sufficient funding, the facility can procure essential pharmaceutical products to improve access to quality care.

The hospital plans to erect relevant signage in respective service areas to ease the flow of service provision to patients.

JOOTRH has a 13-bed ICU with operational patient monitors.



Cancer

Already the county government had started the construction of a cancer centre. But with financial challenges the project stalled.

With these hitches, Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Susan Nakhumicha pledged Sh100 million to complete the construction of the cancer centre.

If completed, the cancer centre will ultimately reduce the need for patients to travel long distances for cancer treatment.

Celestine Agutu, a resident of Kisumu said that it will be a relief for cancer patients and those with chronic illnesses who currently seek services in Eldoret and Nairobi.

“When the resources are available for the public facility, then there will be enough budget allocation and equipment to take care of the needs of the residents,” said Ms Agutu.

Presently, the regional referral hospital offers oncology services for both adults and children.



Recommendations

The health oversight authority pointed out that the facility needed to improve waste management within the hospital, increase the number of staff and streamline its emergency preparedness and outpatient department.

The authority also proposed that JOOTRH expand the Emergency and Accident department to accommodate more patients.

Previously the facility has been on the receiving end with complaints of drug shortage, blood and generally slow service delivery.

Kevin Otieno, a resident of Kisumu suggests that the national government employs more health workers at the facility to manage the increasing number of patients seeking medical attention.

“The hospital needs to recruit additional staff, including critical care nurses, general nurses, medical officers, specialists and medical officer interns. This may necessitate increased budgetary allocations to support the growing workload,” said Mr Otieno.

JOOTRH currently acts as a training ground for medical students from Maseno and Uzima universities.

During a recent visit to the facility, CS Nakhumicha applauded Governor Nyong'o's administration for surrendering the management of JOOTRH to the national government and castigated some county governments that have clung to similar big health facilities, under the guise of generating on-source revenue at the expense of poor service delivery.

“This is not good thinking because it has an effect on service delivery. Our people need quality health services closer to them and we must have a discussion on how to run these facilities and even the sharing of revenue,” she said.

Joe Biden jabs Donald Trump in election-year roast at correspondents' dinner,"Washington

US President Joe Biden delivered an election-year roast on Saturday night at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner as protesters outside criticized his support for Israel's war against Hamas.

Biden used the annual black-tie event to chide his Republican rival Donald Trump for immaturity, poke fun at his own advanced age and take on the Washington press corps.

""Yes, age is an issue. I'm a grown man, running against a 6-year-old,"" Biden joked.

Biden, 81, later added of former President Trump, 77: ""Age is the only thing we have in common. My vice president actually endorses me.""

Trump reacted to the event by calling it ""really bad"" in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn’t get much worse than this!"" he said.

Demonstrators holding banners outside the gathering at the Washington Hilton chanted about journalists' deaths in Gaza. Hundreds of protesters encouraged journalists to boycott the annual event and shouted down administration officials as they entered.

Biden avoided the large protests at the front of the hotel by arriving through a back entrance, where he was greeted by smaller groups of protesters calling for a ceasefire.

At the century-old event, often referred to as Washington's ""nerd prom,"" hundreds of journalists, politicians and celebrities rubbed elbows in a massive banquet hall. It often features friendly jabs from the president in a closing speech that takes aim at reporters and other guests in the audience.

Biden offered some advice to the press corps.

""I'm sincerely not asking you to take sides. I'm asking you to rise up to the seriousness of the moment. Move past the horse race numbers and the gotcha moments and the distractions, the sideshows that have come to dominate and sensationalize our politics, and focus on what's actually at stake,"" Biden said.

This year, the event was hosted by ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Colin Jost.

Grassroots movement CODEPINK marched to the venue from a nearby park. ""The United States media perpetuates anti-Palestinian narratives and ignores Israeli war crimes,"" the group said on its website.

A growing movement against the war in Gaza has dogged Biden this year including at a $250-per-ticket March fundraiser at New York's Radio City Music Hall that was disrupted by protesters.

Recently, that movement has expanded to college campuses in the U.S., signifying a growing revolt inside the Democratic base that Biden needs to defeat Trump, who is now the Republican frontrunner.

Kelly O'Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, declined to comment on security measures for the dinner.

""The safety and security of our protectees is the US Secret Service's top priority,"" said US Secret Service spokesperson Alexi Worley, who declined to comment further.

Israel's six-month old war against Hamas in Gaza, in response to the October 7 attack by the militant group in southern Israel, has killed more than 34,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say, and caused a humanitarian disaster for the enclave's more than 2 million inhabitants.

The Hamas attack killed 1,200 people in Israel, and led to 253 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

"Iran launches retaliatory attack on Israel with hundreds of drones, missiles","Jerusalem,

Iran launched a swarm of explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel late on Saturday in its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, risking a major escalation as the United States pledged ""ironclad"" backing for Israel.

Sirens wailed and Reuters journalists in Israel said they heard distant heavy thuds and bangs from what local media called aerial interceptions of explosive drones. Authorities said a 7-year-old girl was critically injured.

Israel's military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Iran launched dozens of ground-to-ground missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted outside Israeli borders. They included more than 10 cruise missiles, he said.

The Iranian salvo amounted to more than 200 drones and missiles so far, Hagari said, and had caused light damage to one Israeli military facility.

The Israeli military said later that it was not advising any residents to prepare to take shelter, revising an earlier alert in what appeared to signal the end of the threat.

Israel's Channel 12 TV cited an unnamed Israeli official as saying there would be a ""significant response"" to the attack.

Iran had vowed retaliation for what it called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on April 1 that killed seven Guards officers including two senior commanders and said its strike was a punishment for ""Israeli crimes"". Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the consulate attack.

""Should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe,"" the Iranian mission to the United Nations said, warning the U.S. to ""stay away"". However, it also said Iran now ""deemed the matter concluded"".

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Iran's attack, saying he was ""deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation.""

The UN Security Council aims to meet at 4 pm ET (2000 GMT) on Sunday, a diplomat said on condition of anonymity, after Israel requested it condemn Iran's attack and designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organisation.

US President Joe Biden, who on Friday had warned Iran against an attack, cut short a weekend visit to his home state of Delaware. Hereturned to Washington and met national security advisers, including his secretaries of defence and state, in the White House Situation Room. He pledged to stand with Israel.

""Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,"" he said on X after the meeting.

The Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, now in its seventh month, has ratcheted up tensions in the region, spreading to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawing long-range fire at Israeli targets from as far away as Yemen and Iraq.

British maritime security company Ambrey said in a statement that drones were also reportedly launched against Israel by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group.

Those clashes now threaten to morph into a direct open conflict pitting Iran and its regional allies against Israel and its main supporter, the United States. Regional power Egypt urged ""utmost restraint"".

While Israel and Iran have been bitter foes for decades, their long feud has mostly unfolded via proxy forces or by targeting each other's forces operating in third countries.

U.S. and British warplanes were involved in shooting down some Israel-bound drones over the Iraq-Syria border area, Channel 12 reported. Two U.S. officials said the U.S. military had shot down dozens of drone aircraft headed for Israel.



ESCALATION

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose official jet took off shortly after the attack began, convened the war cabinet at a military headquarters in Tel Aviv, his office said.

Israel and Lebanon said they were closing their airspace on Saturday night. Jordan, which lies between Iran and Israel, had readied air defences to intercept any drone or missile that violated its territory, two regional security sources said.

Residents in several Jordanian cities said they heard heavy aerial activity.

Syria, an ally of Iran, said it was putting its ground-to-air defence systems around the capital and major bases on high alert, army sources there said.

The European Union, Britain, France, Mexico, Czechia, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands all condemned Iran's attack.

,"Sporadic incidents of tension, mayhem and chaos involving unknown goons have been reported in Keroka town since the advent of devolution, the latest being on April 11.

So, what could be the reason behind such incidents in a town originally dominated by a single community – the Abagusii?

Here is an explainer.

The tension comes from a boundary dispute that has now escalated to an Appeal Court in Kisumu.

In the dispute is the emotive issue of double-taxation of market traders concerning rents, rates, licenses and other statutory deductions.

A three-judge bench composed of Justices Hannah Okwengu, Ali-Aroni and Joel Ngugi is currently reviewing the matter after the Kisii County Government appealed the decision of an Environment and Lands Court at Nyamira that had initially determined the matter.

Also, the dispute could be linked to political supremacy battles between Kisii County Governor Simba Arati and his Nyamira counterpart Amos Nyaribo.

Arati is the National Deputy Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement party. He has maintained that Kisii and Nyamira are composed of one Abagusii community that is under the control of the Raila Odinga-led Orange party.

On the other hand, Governor Nyaribo is the party leader of the relatively new United Progressive Alliance party.

The party, Mr Nyaribo argues, is the home of the Omogusii after the dissolution of the Simeon Nyachae-led Ford People Party in 2016.

UPA has a majority of MCAs in the Nyamira County Assembly.

Rigoma Ward MCA and journalist Nyambega Gisesa is the national chairman of the UPA.

It was Mr Gisesa who, in May 2023, petitioned the National Lands Commission, the Independent Electoral And Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the Kisii County Government, and the Ministry of Lands over the unresolved boundary dispute in Keroka - leading to the Environment and Lands Court ruling.

The conflict has led to an alleged loss of a boda boda shed worth Sh700,000 at Ichuni junction, Sh2 million worth of a public toilet and van, stalls and stock belonging to small business traders.

The Nyamira County Government claims more than 90 per cent of the town, and Kisi County wants a share of parts of the centre, asserting that the trading centre has expanded from the small market centre that it was into its territory.

Accordingly, Kisii County is claiming ownership of more than 50 per cent of the town.

On the other hand, the Nyamira County Government, in January 2024, changed Keroka into a municipality due to what the county assembly found to be its steady growth over the years.

This was done as per the Urban Areas and Cities Act 2011, when it was established that Keroka had a population of 107,922 people, far beyond the 50,000 threshold.

While signing the municipality approval documents, Nyaribo directed that the municipality have its headquarters at Rigoma.

Keroka Municipality is the second largest in the entire Gusii Nation (Kisii and Nyamira counties) - larger than even Nyamira town itself – which serves as the county headquarters.

The name Keroka emanated from the name of a shrub – emeroka - that surrounded the town.

Formerly Keroka Market Centre, Keroka lies along the busy Kisii-Sotik-Nairobi Highway and on the border of present-day Kisii-Nyamira counties.

The market emerged as an agricultural town but has witnessed steady growth over the years, attracting non-native traders.

Nyamira District, present-day Nyamira County, was hived off from Kisii District and established under Section 6 of the Districts and Provinces Act.

Keroka town was established as an Urban Council in 1979 courtesy of then-area Member of Parliament John Andrew Omanga.

It became a town council in 1997.

Some parties in the court dispute claim that the town council’s mayor during that time was from Ichuni ward, which is part of Kisii County, and jurisdiction was entirely with the former Kisii District, present-day Kisii County.

Kisii County argues that Ichuni Ward is demarcated by EBC as entirely falling within its territory.

IEBC's allocation of Keroka Farmers Union and Keroka Bus Park polling stations is the reason behind this argument.

The votes, they say, have all along been tallied for various administrative seats in Kisii County and that even the 2019 Census was conducted and tallied as part of Kisii County population.

At the advent of devolution when the conflicts started, former governors James Ongwae of Kisii and John Nyagarama (late) of Nyamira met with other leaders on May 21, 2012, and a resolution that there was no boundary dispute as conventional boundaries at the town were well known.

A joint working committee in Keroka town was to report to Mr Nyagarama to create one centre of power. Mr Nyagarama, in turn, was to share reports with Mr Ongwae.

The duo was to appoint a town administrator and a deputy administrator who would oversee the service delivery in the town, such as garbage collection, provision of water, and firefighting, among others.

On May 21, 2014, various leaders from the two counties met at Nairobi Club and formed a committee on the administration and management of Keroka town.

Accordingly, issues of Keroka were to be managed jointly by the two counties as a way to ensure a lasting solution.

,"Sporadic incidents of tension, mayhem and chaos involving unknown goons have been reported in Keroka town since the advent of devolution, the latest being on April 11.

So, what could be the reason behind such incidents in a town originally dominated by a single community – the Abagusii?

Here is an explainer.

The tension comes from a boundary dispute that has now escalated to an Appeal Court in Kisumu.

In the dispute is the emotive issue of double-taxation of market traders concerning rents, rates, licenses and other statutory deductions.

A three-judge bench composed of Justices Hannah Okwengu, Ali-Aroni and Joel Ngugi is currently reviewing the matter after the Kisii County Government appealed the decision of an Environment and Lands Court at Nyamira that had initially determined the matter.

Also, the dispute could be linked to political supremacy battles between Kisii County Governor Simba Arati and his Nyamira counterpart Amos Nyaribo.

Arati is the National Deputy Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement party. He has maintained that Kisii and Nyamira are composed of one Abagusii community that is under the control of the Raila Odinga-led Orange party.

On the other hand, Governor Nyaribo is the party leader of the relatively new United Progressive Alliance party.

The party, Mr Nyaribo argues, is the home of the Omogusii after the dissolution of the Simeon Nyachae-led Ford People Party in 2016.

UPA has a majority of MCAs in the Nyamira County Assembly.

Rigoma Ward MCA and journalist Nyambega Gisesa is the national chairman of the UPA.

It was Mr Gisesa who, in May 2023, petitioned the National Lands Commission, the Independent Electoral And Boundaries Commission (IEBC), the Kisii County Government, and the Ministry of Lands over the unresolved boundary dispute in Keroka - leading to the Environment and Lands Court ruling.

The conflict has led to an alleged loss of a boda boda shed worth Sh700,000 at Ichuni junction, Sh2 million worth of a public toilet and van, stalls and stock belonging to small business traders.

The Nyamira County Government claims more than 90 per cent of the town, and Kisi County wants a share of parts of the centre, asserting that the trading centre has expanded from the small market centre that it was into its territory.

Accordingly, Kisii County is claiming ownership of more than 50 per cent of the town.

On the other hand, the Nyamira County Government, in January 2024, changed Keroka into a municipality due to what the county assembly found to be its steady growth over the years.

This was done as per the Urban Areas and Cities Act 2011, when it was established that Keroka had a population of 107,922 people, far beyond the 50,000 threshold.

While signing the municipality approval documents, Nyaribo directed that the municipality have its headquarters at Rigoma.

Keroka Municipality is the second largest in the entire Gusii Nation (Kisii and Nyamira counties) - larger than even Nyamira town itself – which serves as the county headquarters.

The name Keroka emanated from the name of a shrub – emeroka - that surrounded the town.

Formerly Keroka Market Centre, Keroka lies along the busy Kisii-Sotik-Nairobi Highway and on the border of present-day Kisii-Nyamira counties.

The market emerged as an agricultural town but has witnessed steady growth over the years, attracting non-native traders.

Nyamira District, present-day Nyamira County, was hived off from Kisii District and established under Section 6 of the Districts and Provinces Act.

Keroka town was established as an Urban Council in 1979 courtesy of then-area Member of Parliament John Andrew Omanga.

It became a town council in 1997.

,"Meru County Governor Kawira Mwangaza may have publicly announced her decision to join President William Ruto’s UDA without any proof of registration and membership certificate.

If she indeed proves her new membership with UDA, she may have shot herself in the foot following her decision to join the ruling party.

But before she is included in the list of the UDA party, returns must be filed with the Office Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) showing she has changed status.

Read: Explainer: Why Kenya is taking part in the Haiti mission

Ms Mwangaza was elected in the August 9, 2022 general election as an independent candidate based on the provisions of Article 85 of the constitution on the eligibility of one to stand as an independent candidate.

It states: “Any person is eligible to stand as an independent candidate for election if the person is not a member of a registered political party and has not been a member for at least three months immediately before the date of the election.”

There is however a lacuna in law, the constitution and the subsidiary law on

on the status of leaders elected as independent candidates joining political parties midstream their terms.

Section 14 of the Political Parties Act, 2022 provides for the resignation from a political party but does not address that of an independent candidate, joining a party.

Therefore, once the returns of Governor Mwangaza’s membership with UDA are filed with the ORPP, she stands a candidate for removal from office for abandoning her independent candidate status and joining a political party.

Now, having “joined” UDA, Governor Mwangaza is left with no option but to resign as a Meru Governor and seek a fresh mandate from the people of Meru on the UDA ticket.

As per the constitution in Article 182 (1), it provides for how a vacancy in the office of a County Governor comes about.

The Article states that the office of the county governor shall become vacant if the holder of the office dies, resigns and in writing, addressed to the speaker of the County Assembly.

A person also ceases to be a County Governor if the person is convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months, is removed from office under “this” constitution or ceases to be eligible to be elected county governor under Article 180 (2) of the constitution.

Now, Article 180 (1) of the constitution states that the county governor shall be directly elected by the voters registered in the county, on the same day as a general election of Members of Parliament, being the second Tuesday in August, in every fifth year.

It goes on in sub-article 2 to state that to be eligible for election as county governor, a person must be eligible for election as a Member of the County Assembly (MCA).

To be eligible for election as an MCA, one is required to satisfy the requirements of Article 193 (1) (c) (ii) of the constitution.

This provision states that unless disqualified, a person is eligible for election as a member of a county assembly if the person is either nominated by a political party or an independent candidate supported by at least five hun­dred registered voters in the ward concerned.

Sometime back, Isiolo County Governor Abdi Guyo claimed to have left his Jubilee Party for UDA.

However, to date, his supposed new party is yet to file returns with the ORPP showing his changed party status because he knows the consequences.

So, Governor Mwangaza “joining” UDA could be another red herring.

"Trump calls migrants 'animals,' intensifying focus on illegal immigration","Donald Trump called immigrants illegally in the United States ""animals"" and ""not human"" in a speech in Michigan on Tuesday, resorting to the degrading rhetoric he has employed time and again on the campaign trail.

The Republican presidential candidate, appearing with several law enforcement officers, described in detail several criminal cases involving suspects in the country illegally and warned that violence and chaos would consume America if he did not win the November 5 election.

In a later speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin, he struck a similarly foreboding tone, describing the 2024 election as the nation's ""final battle.""

While speaking of Laken Riley - a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia allegedly murdered by a Venezuelan immigrant in the country illegally - Trump said some immigrants were sub-human.

""The Democrats say, 'Please don't call them animals. They're humans.' I said, 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals,'"" said Trump, president from 2017 to 2021.

In Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump described meeting the family of Ruby Garcia, a local 25-year-old murdered last month by a suspect in the country illegally, according to police. Garcia's sister denied the former president spoke with the family, according to local media reports.

In stump speeches, Trump frequently claims that immigrants crossing the border with Mexico illegally have escaped from prisons and asylums in their home countries and are fueling violent crime in the United States.

While available data on criminals' immigration status is sparse, researchers say people living in the U.S. illegally do not commit violent crimes at a higher rate than native-born citizens.

Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump's rival in the November presidential election, accuses Trump of encouraging Republicans in Congress not to pass legislation this year that would have beefed up security at the southern border and introduced measures aimed at reducing illegal immigration.

""Donald Trump is engaging in extreme rhetoric that promotes division, hate and violence in our country,"" Michael Tyler, Biden campaign communications director, told reporters on Tuesday ahead of Trump's speeches.

Trump titled his Michigan speech ""Biden's border bloodbath,"" and said he met family members of Garcia, who was allegedly murdered last month in her car by Brandon Ortiz-Vite, 25, whom she was dating.

""They said she had just this most contagious laughter, and when she walked into a room, she lit up that room, and I've heard that from so many people. I spoke to some of her family,"" Trump said.

Mavi Garcia, Ruby Garcia's sister, disputed that account, according to local television stations.

""He did not speak with any of us, so it was kind of shocking seeing that he had said that he had spoke with us,"" Mavi Garcia was quoted as saying by a local NBC affiliate.

Reuters was not able to immediately contact Garcia's family. A Trump campaign representative declined to comment on the record.

The murders of Garcia and Riley have allowed Trump's campaign to play simultaneously to some voters' fears about violent crime and immigration.

Some 38% of Republicans cited immigration as the country's top issue in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late February, as did about one in five independents.Trump frequently claims without evidence that migrants have caused a spike in violent crime in U.S. cities. On Tuesday, he repeated an unfounded claim that Latin American nations are intentionally sending their criminals to the United States.

TUESDAY'S WISCONSIN PRIMARY

During his evening speech in Wisconsin, Trump pledged he would stop the ""plunder, rape, slaughter and destruction of our American suburbs, cities and towns.""

He also warned that the coming election could be America's last.

""This country is finished if we don't win this election,"" he said. ""And I heard somebody say ... two or three days ago, said, if we don't win, this may be the last election our country ever has. And there could be truth to it.""

Michigan and Wisconsin are two swing states that could determine whether Biden or Trump occupies the White House next year.

In the 2020 election, Biden beat Trump in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point and in Michigan by less than three. Both states are expected to be extremely close again this year.

Although both Trump and Biden have mathematically clinched their presidential nominations, they will be on their party's presidential primary ballots in Wisconsin on Tuesday.

The Biden team will be watching for protest votes by Democrats angry over the president's strong support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.

In February's presidential primary in Michigan, a state with a large Muslim population, Biden easily won the primary but more than 100,000 Democrats voted ""uncommitted,"" instead of for Biden, as a protest over his Gaza policy.

A similar option is available in Wisconsin on Tuesday. The protest campaign's goal is to get 20,682 voters to mark their ballots ""uninstructed,"" Wisconsin's version of ""uncommitted."" The number is significant because it represents Biden's winning margin over Trump in the state in 2020.","By

"Trump can't match Biden's 2024 fundraising, Republican's campaign says","Donald Trump will be unable to match President Joe Biden's fundraising totals in this year's presidential election race, the Republican candidate's campaign said on Thursday.

""We're never gonna be able to raise dollar for dollar with Biden,"" a Trump campaign adviser said in a call with reporters.

The adviser blamed the fundraising disparity on ""billionaire"" supporters of the Democratic president, and appeared keen to paint a picture of a Trump campaign fueled by grassroots, working-class supporters.

A second campaign adviser said Trump's campaign is ""fueled by hundreds of thousands of grassroots contributors across the country, and I'd much rather have that because each one of those votes.""

Asked for a response, Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said: ""Trump's campaign is strapped for cash.""

Democratic candidates have raised more money in support of their White House bids than their Republican counterparts in all election cycles after 2004. Money, however is not always an indication of success; Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though she raised far more cash than he did.

Biden has been routinely outraising former President Trump, whose campaign, together with a joint fundraising committee, pulled in $20.3 million in February compared with the more than $53 million raised by Biden's reelection effort that month.

Large contributions make up about 55% of the $128.7 million that Biden's campaign committee has raised so far in the election cycle, OpenSecrets data showed, compared with 45% from small contributions.

For Trump, large contributions comprise 64% of the $96.1 million his campaign committee has raised, versus 36% from small contributions.

The two face a Nov. 5 general election rematch, in a race that opinion polls suggest will be extremely close.

Biden was holding a star-studded fundraiser in New York on Thursday night with his Democratic predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton that his campaign said has already raised $25 million.

The Trump campaign is due to hold a fundraiser on April 6 hosted by billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson in south Florida that aims to bring in $33 million, according to a person familiar with the event.

The Trump advisers on Thursday said that together with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will be opening dozens of offices and hiring hundreds of staff in the next few weeks, as they ramp up their general election infrastructure now that Trump has become the Republican Party's presidential candidate.

Trump cemented his grip over the RNC in March when a loyalist, his daughter-in-law, and a senior campaign adviser were installed as chair, co-chair and chief of staff of the organization following his endorsement. An aggressive overhaul ensued, with dozens of employees losing their jobs.

As part of the leadership restructuring, a new slate of deputies will focus on battleground states as well as relationships with state parties and grassroots organizations, the second Trump campaign adviser said. Gone are regional directors who oversaw broad areas of the country.

""Folks that are focused on the battleground states will have a very narrow focus,"" the adviser said. ""We will not have that sort of middle layer that has historically existed to oversee a large region.""","By

Trump cemented his grip over the RNC in March when a loyalist, his daughter-in-law, and a senior campaign adviser were installed as chair, co-chair and chief of staff of the organization following his endorsement. An aggressive overhaul ensued, with dozens of employees losing their jobs.

As part of the leadership restructuring, a new slate of deputies will focus on battleground states as well as relationships with state parties and grassroots organizations, the second Trump campaign adviser said. Gone are regional directors who oversaw broad areas of the country.

""Folks that are focused on the battleground states will have a very narrow focus,"" the adviser said. ""We will not have that sort of middle layer that has historically existed to oversee a large region.""","By

Trump says he would take 'appropriate action' over Prince Harry visa question,"Former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said if Prince Harry lied on his visa application about drug-taking Trump would seek to take ""appropriate action"" if he won November's presidential election, declining to rule out Harry leaving the United States.

Trump's comments to British right-leaning media outlet GB News came in an interview with presenter and frequent Harry critic Nigel Farage.

U.S. visa applicants are required to make a disclosure about any history of drug use, which can impact their application. Lying on an application can result in penalties including deportation.

Harry, who has lived in California since 2020, admitted to past illegal drug use in his memoir ""Spare,"" after which conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation sued the U.S. Homeland Security Department to access his immigration records. Earlier this month, a judge ruled in that case that the details pertaining to Harry's visa application should be handed over to court.

Farage, a long-time Trump ally, asked the Republican presidential candidate if Prince Harry should receive any ""special privileges"" if he lied in his application.

""No. We'll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they'll have to take appropriate action,"" Trump replied.

When asked if that might mean Harry ""not staying in America,"" the former president replied: ""Oh I don't know. You'll have to tell me. You just have to tell me. You would have thought they would have known this a long time ago.""

Since Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle left royal duties and moved to California, they have often railed at their treatment by Britain's royal family.

From an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021 to a Netflix documentary series and Harry's book, the couple have asserted that the royals and their aides failed to protect them from a hostile press and leaked negative stories about them.

The couple, who married in 2018, have rarely returned to Britain since their departure for the United States.","By

,"While sentencing Joseph Kuria Irungu alias Jowie to death for the murder of Monica Kimani, High Court judge Grace Nzioka said the killing was intentional and it was not as a result of provocation.

The judge added that it is not that Jowie did not have an opportunity to reflect on his actions before committing the offence because it was premeditated, planned and executed with subsequent destruction of evidence.

In the judge’s view, the offender deserves no mercy for what he had done to the victim.

After the death sentence what next for Jowie?

His lawyer Andrew Muge said he would appeal against both the sentence and the conviction, as provided for in law within 14 days from the date of the judgement.

According to Mr Muge, the prosecution failed to give exculpatory evidence (evidence that would have absolved him of the offence), including the photographs of a pair of shorts he allegedly wore on the night of September 19, 2018.

The lawyer said Jowie wore a pair of brown khaki shorts, with side pockets. But the one produced in court, and which linked him to the murder- as blood samples collected on it were Monica’s- were different.

He said DNA results found on the straps that were used to tie Monica, showed that there were two unknown males, who accessed the house.

Mr Muge further said they will also be raising the issue of the time recorded at the entrance to Lamuria Gardens Apartment. He said there was contradictory evidence as to whether he left the house at 9pm or 11pm.

Will Jowie face the hangman?

Kenya has not executed anyone on death row since 1987 when Hezekiah Ochuka and Pancras Oteyo Okumu were hanged for their role in the attempted coup.

Reports published by lobby groups, who have sought for the abolishment of the death penalty state that from independence in 1963 to 1987, only 280 persons out of 3,584 people sentenced to death, were executed in Kenya.

In 2009, President Mwai Kibaki commuted the sentences of more than 4,000 convicts from death to life imprisonment. His successor Uhuru Kenyatta commuted the sentences of another 2,747 in 2016 to life imprisonment.

Read: The mysterious life of Joseph 'Jowie’ Irungu

The latest commutations were done by President William Ruto in July last year, of all death sentences from November 21, 2022, to life imprisonment as recommended by the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (POMAC).

POMAC is chaired by Attorney General Justin Muturi and derives its powers from The Power of Mercy Act 2011, which allows the President to grant a free or conditional pardon to a person convicted of an offence.

What does the death sentence mean?

Death in Kenya is carried out by hanging. Under section 332(3) of the criminal procedure code, a death warrant must be issued and signed by the President for the death to be carried out. The warrant must also state the place and time of the execution. The death warrant must also provide directions as to the place of burial or cremation of the body of the person to be executed.

What other offences carry a death sentence?

The penal code imposes a death sentence for the offences of murder, treason, robbery with violence, attempted robbery with violence and administration of unlawful oaths to commit capital offences and the International Crimes Act.

Have there been attempts to abolish the death sentence?

Yes. Several human rights groups have argued for the abolishment of the death sentence. In 2017, the Supreme Court declared the mandatory nature of the death sentence unconstitutional. With the quashing of the section, judges hearing capital offences have the discretion to impose the sentence they deem appropriate after considering the gravity of the offence and the mitigation of the offender.

The top court judges said a person facing the death sentence is most deserving to be heard in mitigation because of the finality of the sentence.

What does a life sentence mean?

In Kenya, it is assumed that the life sentence means the number of years of the prisoner’s natural life, which ceases upon his or her death. Lobbyists, however, want this to be abolished and Parliament to come up with minimum and maximum sentences for serious offences such as murder, robbery with violence and attempted robbery with violence.

The lobby groups argue that a life sentence is also punitive and defeats the whole purpose of sending prisoners to jail- of rehabilitating them. They argue that keeping them in jail until they pass on, is also expensive given that a prisoner spends more money for their upkeep in prison.

The Supreme Court declined an invitation by two convicts to define what constitutes a life sentence. Instead, the six judges of the apex court (Justice Mohammed Ibrahim had been indisposed) directed the Attorney General and Parliament to commence an enquiry and develop legislation on the definition of what constitutes a life sentence.

What has Parliament done so far?

MPs have been mulling over abolishing the death sentence and replacing it with life imprisonment, by amending the Penal Code Act. The Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2023, pushed by the leader of majority in the National Assembly Opiyo Wandayi seeks to erase the imposition of the death sentence against capital offenders.

The Bill is currently before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) of the National Assembly for prepublication scrutiny.

Mr Wandayi said abolishing the death penalty will help to preserve the fundamental right to life under Article 26 of the Constitution and put an end to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment of condemned persons, occasioned by the enforcement of the death penalty. The MP added that the abolishment of the death penalty will also stop the psychological trauma that convicts go through.

"After Trump meet, Musk says he won't donate to either US presidential candidate","Billionaire Elon Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla TSLA.O, said on Wednesday that he will not donate money to either Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Democratic President Joe Biden in this year's election, one day after meeting Trump in Florida.

Trump met with Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, with a small group of other people in Florida over the weekend, a source confirmed to Reuters, as the former president seeks a major cash infusion for his campaign.

In a post on his social media platform X, Musk said: ""Just to be super clear, I am not donating money to either candidate for US President.""

In 2022, Musk asked Americans to elect a Republican Congress in U.S. midterm elections in order to counterbalance Biden's Democrats.

"Biden, Trump woo Haley voters, 2024 election's new prize","Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump are scrambling to win over supporters of Nikki Haley, a constituency that could be crucial to sending either man back to the White House.

Haley dropped out of the Republican presidential nomination contest on Wednesday but did not endorse Trump and said it was now up to him to ""earn"" the support of voters who did not initially back him.

Almost 570,000 voters in three key battleground states - Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan - voted for Haley in the Republican nominating contest, a small but potentially significant group in races that have been decided by tiny margins in recent elections.

Haley won 250,000 votes in North Carolina's primary, for example, a state that Trump won by less than 75,000 votes in 2020.

Both Biden and Trump quickly put out statements on Wednesday calling on Haley voters to join their team - although they used vastly different tactics.

Biden commended Haley on ""speaking the truth"" about Trump, while Trump said he had ""trounced"" her in the Super Tuesday Republican contest.

""Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,"" Biden said in a statement.

In his Truth Social post, Trump added that he ""would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation,"" and described Biden as an enemy who is destroying the country.

Trump has derided Haley throughout the campaign - including using sexist and racist language. And many of her voters have wondered if they still have a place in the Republican Party, which has coalesced around Trump, despite his repeated lies about having won the 2020 election against Biden, and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Still, some experts say there's little precedent for Republicans like Haley's supporters to automatically come out for a Democrat in a general election.

""The next several months are going to be about the two candidates trying to convince people to come home to their regular party,"" said Hans Noel, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University.

""Right now, the numbers are really high for Haley voters to say 'I would never vote for Trump.' But almost certainly most of them will come around and either vote for Trump or they might not vote at all,"" he said, citing historical precedent.

Political strategists believe a significant number of Haley voters were Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents who crossed over to vote in Republican primary contests, to try to deliver a blow to Trump.

Still, a bevy of anti-Trump groups will be working hard to convince Haley voters to get behind Biden.

Reed Galen, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a prominent anti-Trump group of current and former Republicans, said Haley had shown that there are up to 30% of Republican voters who do not like Trump, a figure that would represent about 11 million registered Republicans nationwide.

Galen said his group will target them between now and November's general election, aiming $50 million at an anti-Trump, pro-Biden persuasion campaign focused on battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.

The digital and TV ad campaign will focus on abortion rights, the blow to U.S. prestige abroad under Trump, and his failure to fully support Ukraine in its war against Russia.

PrimaryPivot, another pro-Haley group, changed its name to Haley Voters for Biden just after Haley dropped out of the race.

Co-founder Robert Schwartz said the group will target the roughly 500,000 voters who backed Haley in the primary campaign in Michigan and North Carolina, as well as possible Haley voters in Georgia, which holds its primary March 12.

Republican strategist Ford O'Connell, who worked with Trump during the 2020 campaign, said he expected Trump to extend an ""olive branch"" to Haley supporters but that many were not persuadable.

O'Connell noted that Trump did not go after Haley in his speech on Tuesday night. Trump showed that he ""understood that the way to victory is to stay on the issues: the border, prices, foreign policy,"" O'Connell said.","By

"Nikki Haley to end White House bid, clearing path for a Trump-Biden rematch","Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.

Haley will give a speech at 10am local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time.

She will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added.

Haley's decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests.

Haley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the party's base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments.

The rematch between Trump, 77, and Biden, 81 - the first repeat U.S. presidential contest since 1956 - is one that few Americans want. Opinion polls show both Biden and Trump have low approval ratings among voters.

The election promises to be deeply divisive in a country already riven by political polarisation. Biden has cast Trump as an existential danger to democratic principles, while Trump has sought to re-litigate his false claims that he won in 2020.

Haley, 52, had drawn support from deep-pocketed donors intent on stopping Trump from winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, particularly after she notched a series of strong performances at debates that Trump opted to skip.

She ultimately failed to pry loose enough conservative voters in the face of Trump's dominance.

But her stronger showing among moderate Republicans and independents - she won unaffiliated voters by a wide margin in New Hampshire and notched almost 40 per cent of the vote in South Carolina - highlighted how Trump's scorched-earth style of politics could make him vulnerable in the Nov. 5 election.

On March 3, she won the Washington, D.C., Republican primary with 62.9% of the vote, versus 33.2 per cent for Trump. On Tuesday, her only win came in Vermont, a small, deeply Democratic state.

Biden has his own baggage, including widespread concern about his age. Three-quarters of respondents in a February Reuters/Ipsos poll said he was too old to work in government, after already serving as the oldest U.S. president in history.

About half of respondents said the same about Trump.

Key issues

As in 2020, the race is likely to come down to a handful of swing states, thanks to the winner-take-all, state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the presidential election. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all expected to be closely contested in November.

The central issues of the campaign have already come into focus. Despite low unemployment, a red-hot stock market and easing inflation, voters have voiced dissatisfaction with Biden's economic performance.

Biden's other major weakness is the state of the U.S.-Mexico border, where a surge of migrants overwhelmed the system after Biden eased some Trump-era policies. Trump's hawkish stance on immigration - including a promise to initiate the largest deportation effort in history - is at the core of his campaign, just as it was in 2016.

Voters expect Trump would do a better job on both the economy and immigration, according to opinion polls.

Republican lawmakers, egged on by Trump, rejected a bipartisan immigration enforcement bill in February, giving Biden an opportunity to argue that Republicans are more interested in preserving the southern border as a problem rather than finding a solution.

Democrats are also optimistic that voter sentiment on the economy will shift in Biden's favour if economic trends go on rising throughout 2024.

Trump may be dogged by his myriad criminal charges throughout the year, though the schedule of his trials remains unclear. The federal case charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 election, perhaps the weightiest he faces, has been paused while Trump pursues a long-shot argument that he is immune from prosecution.

While most Republicans view his indictments as politically motivated, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, about a quarter of Republicans and half of independents say they won't support him if he is convicted of a crime before the election.

Biden has argued that Trump poses a threat to democracy, citing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to reverse Biden's 2020 victory.

Abortion, too, will play a crucial role after the nine-member U.S. Supreme Court, buoyed by three Trump appointees, eliminated a nationwide right to terminate pregnancies in 2022. The subject has become a political liability for Republicans, helping Democrats over-perform expectations in the 2022 midterm elections.

Abortion rights advocates have launched efforts to put the issue before voters in several states, including the battleground of Arizona.

Haley thwarted

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, had been among the first Republican contenders to enter the race in February 2023, but she was largely an afterthought until garnering attention for her standout debate performances later in the year.

She put her foreign policy expertise at the centre of her campaign, adopting hawkish stances toward China and Russia and forcefully advocating for continued aid to Ukraine, a stance that put her at odds with the more isolationist Trump.

But she was reluctant to completely disavow her former boss - she served as Trump's U.N. ambassador - despite his four indictments and two impeachments. Trump showed no such reticence, frequently insulting her intelligence and Indian heritage.

Only in the last months of her campaign did Haley begin to forcefully hit back at Trump, questioning his mental acuity, calling him a liar and saying he was too afraid to debate her.

In the final weeks of the campaign, she became the standard-bearer for the anti-Trump wing of the party, a dramatic evolution for someone who just months earlier praised the former president in her stump speeches.

Still, she said she would pardon Trump if he were convicted in any of the criminal cases he faces, a position she has never abandoned.","By

"Nikki Haley to end White House bid, clearing path for a Trump-Biden rematch","Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in November's election.

Haley will give a speech at 10am local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time.

She will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added.

Haley's decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests.

Haley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the party's base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments.

The rematch between Trump, 77, and Biden, 81 - the first repeat U.S. presidential contest since 1956 - is one that few Americans want. Opinion polls show both Biden and Trump have low approval ratings among voters.

The election promises to be deeply divisive in a country already riven by political polarisation. Biden has cast Trump as an existential danger to democratic principles, while Trump has sought to re-litigate his false claims that he won in 2020.

Haley, 52, had drawn support from deep-pocketed donors intent on stopping Trump from winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, particularly after she notched a series of strong performances at debates that Trump opted to skip.

She ultimately failed to pry loose enough conservative voters in the face of Trump's dominance.

But her stronger showing among moderate Republicans and independents - she won unaffiliated voters by a wide margin in New Hampshire and notched almost 40 per cent of the vote in South Carolina - highlighted how Trump's scorched-earth style of politics could make him vulnerable in the Nov. 5 election.

On March 3, she won the Washington, D.C., Republican primary with 62.9% of the vote, versus 33.2 per cent for Trump. On Tuesday, her only win came in Vermont, a small, deeply Democratic state.

Biden has his own baggage, including widespread concern about his age. Three-quarters of respondents in a February Reuters/Ipsos poll said he was too old to work in government, after already serving as the oldest U.S. president in history.

About half of respondents said the same about Trump.

Key issues

As in 2020, the race is likely to come down to a handful of swing states, thanks to the winner-take-all, state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the presidential election. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all expected to be closely contested in November.

The central issues of the campaign have already come into focus. Despite low unemployment, a red-hot stock market and easing inflation, voters have voiced dissatisfaction with Biden's economic performance.

Biden's other major weakness is the state of the U.S.-Mexico border, where a surge of migrants overwhelmed the system after Biden eased some Trump-era policies. Trump's hawkish stance on immigration - including a promise to initiate the largest deportation effort in history - is at the core of his campaign, just as it was in 2016.

Who are the candidates running in 2024 US presidential election?,"Republican former President Donald Trump and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley are competing to be their party's presidential nominee for the 2024 general election, while President Joe Biden is effectively the Democratic Party's nominee. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.

Here is a list of the candidates.

DONALD TRUMP

Trump has leveraged his civil cases and indictments in four criminal cases - unprecedented for a former American president - to boost his popularity among Republicans and raise funds, helping to make him the Republican frontrunner with 64%, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. He scored victories in the early nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and is pushing to replace Republican National Committee leadership with his own top allies ahead of the party's July nominating convention.

Trump, 77, has called the indictments a political witch hunt to thwart his pursuit of a second four-year term, an assertion that the Justice Department has denied. Several legal challenges have reached the US Supreme Court regarding his eligibility for the ballot following the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol and whether he can claim presidential immunity. If elected again, Trump has vowed revenge against his perceived enemies and has adopted increasingly authoritarian language, including saying he would not be a dictator except ""on day one.""

He has promised other sweeping changes, including gutting the federal civil service to install loyalists and imposing tougher immigration policies such as mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship. He has also promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance, vowed harsher curbs on trade with China and suggested he would not defend NATO allies.

NIKKI HALEY

A former South Carolina governor and Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Haley, 52, has emphasized her relative youth compared to Biden, 81, and Trump, as well as her background as the daughter of Indian immigrants.

She had gained a reputation in the Republican Party as a solid conservative who could address issues of gender and race in a more credible fashion than many of her peers. But Trump has increasingly targeted her, lobbing racist attacks at her ethnicity and amplifying false claims about her eligibility for the White House despite her birth in South Carolina.

Haley, who drew 19% support among Republicans in the Reuters/Ipsos survey, has sharpened her attacks on Trump following New Hampshire's Jan. 23 contest and raised $1 million after Trump threatened her donors. She has also pitched herself as a stalwart defender of American interests abroad, citing Trump's praise of dictators, and ramped up her argument that Trump is too chaotic and divisive to be effective.

She has suggested she will stay in the race past the Feb. 24 primary in her home state, where opinion polls show she trails Trump, and her campaign has blasted Trump's proposed RNC changes, saying the political party should be overhauled and its finances audited.

DEMOCRATIC PARTY

JOE BIDEN

Photo credit: Amanda Andrade-Rhoades

Biden, 81, already the oldest U.S. president ever, will have to convince voters he has the stamina for another four years in office, amid poor approval ratings and a special counsel report suggesting he suffered memory lapses. Biden has blasted the report, and his allies say he believes he is the only Democratic candidate who can defeat Trump and protect democracy. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll put Biden at 34%, while Trump garnered 37% — close to the 2.9 percentage-point margin of error.

In announcing his candidacy, Biden declared he needed to defend American liberties and pointed to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters. Vice President Kamala Harris is again his running mate.

The economy will also factor in his reelection campaign. While the US escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation hit 40-year highs in 2022 and the cost of essentials is weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost US  industrial output, but he has received little recognition from voters for the latter.

Biden has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to sanction Russia and support Kyiv, and he has been supportive of Israel in its conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian aid. However, he has faced sharp criticism from some fellow Democrats for not backing a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, where Gaza health officials say more than 28,400 people have been killed, thousands of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and residents have insufficient food, water and medical supplies.

Biden's handling of immigration policy has also been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border hit record highs during his administration.

In the Democratic Party's presidential nominating contests, Biden has easily won in New Hampshire,South Carolina and Nevada.

DEAN PHILLIPS

Dean Phillips, a little-known US congressman from Minnesota, announced in October he would mount a long-shot challenge to Biden because he does not believe the president can win another term.

The 55-year-old millionaire businessman and gelato company co-founder announced his bid in a one-minute video posted online, saying: ""We've got some challenges. ... We're going to repair this economy, and we are going to repair America.""

Phillips failed to win any delegates in South Carolina and took second place in New Hampshire. He did not appear on the Nevada ballot.

An anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination, but he is far behind in polling.

Some recent Reuters/Ipsos polls showed Kennedy could harm Biden more than Trump in the presidential election, where third-party candidates have affected the outcome of US elections even without winning. Trump's six-percentage point lead over Biden in Reuters/Ipsos polling held even when respondents had the option of voting for third-party candidates, including Kennedy, whose support stood at 8%.

Kennedy is the son of USSenator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid. A surprise Super Bowl ad heavily featuring his connection to his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, angered his family members and prompted him to apologize.

He was banned from Instagram for spreading misinformation about vaccines and the Covid-19 pandemic but was later reinstated. He also lost a legal bid to force YouTube owner Google to reinstate videos of him questioning the safety of Covid vaccines.

"Good sex is secret to Joe Biden's long marriage, new book says","Washington,

President Joe Biden has joked to aides that the key to a long and lasting marriage is ""good sex,"" according to a new book about first lady Jill Biden that casts a spotlight on their 47-year romance.

""American Woman - The Transformation of the Modern First Lady, from Hillary Clinton to Jill Biden,"" was authored by New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers and comes out this week.

The part about sex takes up only a few paragraphs in the 276-page book but has already generated headlines.

Rogers writes that Biden opted against running for president in 2004, a decision punctuated to aides when Jill Biden entered the room wearing a halter top with the word ""NO"" scrawled on her stomach.

Joe Biden, now 81, told a group of supporters that year that he had little interest in running for president. ""I'd rather be at home making love to my wife while my children are asleep,"" he said.

The comment drew a shrug from a spokesperson at the time who said then-Senator Biden was ""frankly totally in love with his wife,"" Rogers writes.

""Joe may have tamped down on his public bedroom declarations (in) winning the presidency, but he has joked to aides that 'good sex' is the key to a lasting and happy marriage, much to his wife's chagrin,"" according to Rogers.

The book describes the anguish Joe Biden experienced when his first wife, Neilia, died in a 1972 car crash along with their daughter Naomi.

He and Jill married in 1977, but it took five proposals from Biden to get Jill to agree.

""I've been as patient as I know how to be, but this has got my Irish up. Either you decide to marry me or that's it - I'm out. I'm not asking again,"" Biden said on the fifth try, Rogers writes.","By

Key dates in the 2024 US presidential race,"Former President Donald Trump is the frontrunner to be the Republican presidential nominee in the 2024 election, while President Joe Biden faces little opposition in the Democratic Party in his campaign for a second term.

Here is a timeline of events related to the November 5, 2024, election between now and Inauguration Day in January 2025.

2024

- February 24: South Carolina Republican primary

- February 27: Democrats and Republicans vote in the Michigan state-run primary, which was brought forward by the Democratic-controlled Midwestern state in a move opposed by Republicans. Republicans will instead choose the majority of their delegates during caucuses in March.

- March 2: Republicans in Michigan pick most of their delegates during party-run caucuses.

- March 5: Known as Super Tuesday, this is the biggest single day of primaries.

Jury orders Donald Trump to pay $83 million for sex assault defamation,"New York, United States

A jury in New York ordered former US president and 2024 candidate Donald Trump on Friday to pay $83.3 million to compensate the writer E. Jean Carroll whom he was found to have sexually assaulted and defamed.

The civil order, which prompted an audible gasp in the federal court, far exceeds the more than $10 million in damages for defamation that Carroll had sought.

Trump lashed out almost immediately, calling the verdict ""ridiculous"" in a statement and promising to appeal.

The jury reached its decision after slightly less than three hours of deliberations.

Trump had been in court earlier, storming out at one point but subsequently returning for closing arguments. He was not in court when the level of compensatory and punitive damages were read out by a court clerk.

A juror exchanged a smile with Carroll as the nine men and women left the courtroom after the judge encouraged them to protect their privacy.

""It's clear to me... you paid attention,"" Judge Lewis Kaplan told the jury following the verdict.

The order was comprised of $65 million in punitive damages after the jury found Trump acted maliciously in his many public comments about Carroll, $7.3 million in compensatory damages, and $11 million for a reputational repair program.

""I was not surprised (by the award) partly because his egregious misbehaviour during the trial could actually have alienated the jury,"" said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

""(Trump) is unlikely to prevail on appeal, because the (appeal) judges have great respect for Judge Kaplan, who is a very experienced federal jurist.""

Trump -- whom a jury found liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a separate federal civil case in New York -- used his Truth Social platform to fire off a spate of insulting messages attacking Carroll, the trial, and the judge, whom he called ""an extremely abusive individual.""

""We were stripped of every defense -- every single defense -- before we walked in there,"" said Trump's lawyer Alina Habba outside the court. ""I am proud to stand with president Trump... We will immediately appeal.""

Trump, 77, briefly took the stand on Thursday to deny he instructed anyone to harm Carroll with his statements.

During Trump's testimony, Kaplan limited him to three questions from his lawyers, to which he could only answer yes or no -- a precaution taken to prevent the Republican leader from returning to his custom of disparaging the court or Carroll in public.

""This is not America,"" Trump said as he left the courtroom following his short appearance.

He was not required to attend the trial or to testify. However, he has used the case, as well as others he faces, to generate heated media coverage and to fuel his claims of being victimized as he campaigns for a return to the White House in November's election.

Trump separately faces multiple criminal cases, including his alleged attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Joe Biden, and a civil business fraud case.

Habba sought to have the case thrown out Thursday on the grounds that threatening messages targeting Carroll, which have been aired in the case, began on social media before Trump's 2019 comments. Her request was denied.

Jurors were shown Trump's October 2022 deposition during which he confused a picture of Carroll for his former wife Marla Maples, which threatened to cast doubt on his claim Carroll was not his ""type.""

Last year, another federal jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and subsequently defaming her in 2022, when he called her a ""complete con job.""

Trump had been in court while he campaigned ahead of the New Hampshire primary, which he won handily over his only remaining challenger Nikki Haley, as he closes in on becoming the Republican candidate in the November election against Biden.","By

"US SEnator Tim Scott, who ran for president, endorses Donald Trump","A US senator who sought this year's Republican presidential nomination endorsed Donald Trump on Friday in a boost to the former leader's bid to secure his party's backing to retake the White House.

Senator Tim Scott appeared on stage with the ex-president at a rally in New Hampshire, whose residents vote in the state's primary on Tuesday.

""I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of these United States, president Donald Trump!"" said Scott, who was visiting the northern state during a bitter cold snap, to a chorus of cheers.

""We need Donald Trump,"" Scott said. ""We need a president who unites our country.""

The South Carolina lawmaker was in the race for the nomination until November 12 when he withdrew, declining to endorse any other candidate.

He had hoped to become the first Black Republican president, but struggled to rise above the pack in the party's crowded field.

Regularly polling in sixth place among Republican primary candidates, the 58-year-old drew only around two to three percent of the vote, according to the RealClearPolitics average of major opinion polls.

His backing should boost Trump's so-far dominant effort to fend off challenges for the nomination from former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

The endorsement is likely a bitter pill for Haley, who is from Scott's home state and served as its governor.

CNN reported that Trump had been in discussions with Scott to secure his backing before South Carolina holds its primary election on February 24, but that the announcement was brought forward after Haley saw a bounce in support.

""He's a fantastic man,"" the scandal-plagued Trump said of Scott. ""Having his endorsement means a lot.""

""We have to unify. We have to go after these crazy people that we're dealing with,"" he added, before launching into fierce critiques of Haley.

During his campaign, Scott frequently underlined his Christian faith and the conservative values he learned growing up in a poor, single-parent household.

He was one of five Republicans appearing in the third televised Republican debate last November, as challengers for the nomination sparred over Ukraine, China, abortion and the future of the party.

Scott has expressed no interest in becoming a running mate to any of the remaining candidates, saying that being vice president ""has never been on my to-do list for this campaign.""","By

13 dead in China school fire: state media,"Beijing, China

Thirteen people have died in a school dormitory fire in central China's Henan province, the official Xinhua news agency reported Saturday.

The blaze at the Yingcai School in Henan's Yanshanpu village was reported to the local fire department at 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) Friday night, Xinhua said.

Thirteen people have been confirmed dead, the news agency said, adding that one person was injured.

""Rescuers arrived at the scene quickly and the flames were extinguished at 11:38 p.m.,"" Xinhua said.

The injured survivor ""is currently receiving treatment at the hospital and is in stable condition"", according to Xinhua.

Local authorities are investigating the fire's cause, and at least one person linked to the school has been detained, Xinhua said.

Yanshanpu village lies on the outskirts of Nanyang, a city of nearly 10 million.

Little information about the boarding school is publicly available, though social media videos published earlier showed young children including kindergarteners wearing smocks with the school's logo as well as older children learning calligraphy.

Xinhua did not say how many of the dead were children.

Chinese social media users on Saturday expressed outrage about the fire and called for any safety lapses to be punished.

""It's too scary, 13 children from 13 families, all gone in an instant... if there is no severe punishment their souls will not rest in peace,"" one commenter on the Weibo social site wrote.

Fires and other deadly accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement.

In November, 26 people died and dozens were sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China's Shanxi province.

In July, 11 people died after the roof of a school gym collapsed in the country's northeast.

The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.

In April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to jump out of windows to escape.

After the coal company fire in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the country to ""conduct in-depth investigations of hidden risks in key industries, improve emergency plans and prevention measures"".","By

Harvard University first black female president resigns amidst scandals,"The president of Harvard University resigned Tuesday after coming under ferocious attack over plagiarism accusations and her response to anti-Semitism on campus amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Claudine Gay was criticised in recent months after reports surfaced alleging that she did not properly cite scholarly sources. The most recent accusations came Tuesday, published anonymously in a conservative online outlet.

Gay was also engulfed by scandal after she declined to say unequivocally whether calling for genocide of Jews would violate Harvard's code of conduct, during testimony to Congress alongside the heads of MIT and the University of Pennsylvania last month.

Gay, who made history as the first Black person to be president of the powerhouse university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said in her resignation letter that she'd been subjected to personal threats and ""racial animus.""

Her downfall comes after the university's governing Harvard Corporation had initially backed her after the public relations disaster of the congressional testimony.

But the body did criticise the university's initial response to the Hamas October 7 attacks that Israel said killed 1,140 people inside Israel and saw around 240 people taken hostage.

Israel's offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed at least 22,185 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.

'Racist vitriol'

More than 70 lawmakers, including two Democrats, demanded her resignation, while several high-profile Harvard alumni and donors also called for her departure.

Still, more than 700 Harvard faculty members had signed a letter supporting Gay and her job had appeared to be safe.

The resignation, first reported by the student-run newspaper the Harvard Crimson, was confirmed shortly after by Gay herself.

""It is with a heavy heart but a deep love for Harvard that I write to share that I will be stepping down as president,"" Gay said in a statement.

Read: State of Maine blocks Donald Trump from its Republican presidential primary

Gay also wrote that she had faced threats to her safety and ""racial animus"" in the wake of the furore over her handling of claims of mounting anti-Semitism on campus.

The university's governing Harvard Corporation said that Gay had ""shown remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks.""

""While some of this has played out in the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls. We condemn such attacks.""

In the United States, the anti-Semitism on campus controversy came amid a rise in attacks and violent rhetoric targeting Jews and Muslims, including at universities, since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

The president of another elite Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania, had already been forced to resign.

The House Republican who challenged Gay out during her testimony with the question about whether free speech extended to calling for genocide of Jews celebrated the latest academic's downfall.

""Harvard knows that this long overdue forced resignation of the antisemitic plagiarist president is just the beginning of what will be the greatest scandal of any college or university in history,"" said Representative Elise Stefanik.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a close US ally, has claimed that a ""whopping wave of anti-Semitism"" has ""seeped onto university campuses.""

Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial, has described it as a ""cancer.""

Former student and multi-million-dollar donor Bill Ackman claimed in a letter to Harvard's governing boards that ""President Gay's failures have led to billions of dollars of cancelled, paused, and withdrawn donations to the university.""

Gay, 53, was born in New York to Haitian immigrants and is a professor of political science who in July became the first Black president of 368-year-old Harvard.

""Leadership failure and denial of anti-Semitism have a price. Hope glorious Harvard University learns from this dismal conduct,"" wrote new Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz in response to Gay's departure.","By

""While some of this has played out in the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls. We condemn such attacks.""

In the United States, the anti-Semitism on campus controversy came amid a rise in attacks and violent rhetoric targeting Jews and Muslims, including at universities, since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

The president of another elite Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania, had already been forced to resign.

The House Republican who challenged Gay out during her testimony with the question about whether free speech extended to calling for genocide of Jews celebrated the latest academic's downfall.

""Harvard knows that this long overdue forced resignation of the antisemitic plagiarist president is just the beginning of what will be the greatest scandal of any college or university in history,"" said Representative Elise Stefanik.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a close US ally, has claimed that a ""whopping wave of anti-Semitism"" has ""seeped onto university campuses.""

Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial, has described it as a ""cancer.""

Former student and multi-million-dollar donor Bill Ackman claimed in a letter to Harvard's governing boards that ""President Gay's failures have led to billions of dollars of cancelled, paused, and withdrawn donations to the university.""

Gay, 53, was born in New York to Haitian immigrants and is a professor of political science who in July became the first Black president of 368-year-old Harvard.

""Leadership failure and denial of anti-Semitism have a price. Hope glorious Harvard University learns from this dismal conduct,"" wrote new Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz in response to Gay's departure.","By

Marital rape: Day women refused to suffer in silence,"In 2019, Roselyne Belinda Achieng’ walked out of her marriage after living with her husband for only four years. She was 22 years old.

This is not what the now 26-year-old envisioned when she met her husband a couple of years ago in church. The two later got married.

Ms Achieng’ had enrolled at Kenya Institute of Mass Communication for a Broadcast Journalism course in 2014, but dropped out for lack of funds.

All seemed rosy until one evening when she had just come home, having been discharged from hospital after delivering their second child.

A few hours in, her husband demanded that they get intimate, a request she turned down as she was still nursing some wounds and was also tired.

He would hear none of it. “I just felt him on top of me and had his way with me,” says Ms Achieng’.

On several occasions in the past, he had forced himself on her claiming it was his conjugal right.

Ms Achieng’ invited her husband’s brother to discuss the issue, but this did not help.

“On the following day, his brother said it was something they did to wives, and perfectly normal,” says Ms Achieng’ who adds, however, that as far as she was concerned, her husband raped her.

Nevertheless, she chose to stay; her children needed a present father while the last born was also only days old.

The violence did not, however, stop, and though she wished to share her ordeal with friends, she knew not how to start.

Her next option was to seek help from the church, because this was where it had all begun.

The spiritual leaders advises the couple to resolve their issue amicably. What pained Ms Achieng’, however, is that no one spoke about the fact that she had been raped severally by the person she trusted most.

She felt like the church was siding with the husband instead of solving the real issue.

One day, her husband turned violent and she screamed, attracting neighbours to her rescue.

Events of the day left her husband ashamed while the bond between them grew weaker with each passing day.

Eventually, she walked out of the marriage. Her last-born son was already a year old as she moved in with her parents in Manyatta, Kisumu County, trying to figure out her next move.

“One time, I came across women huddled in a group speaking about rape in their marriages. While I did not join in, I realised I was not alone. There were more silent sufferers in matrimonial homes,” says Ms Achieng’.

She adds: “That is why I later decided to speak up. There are women across the world who have gone through similar experiences but afraid to speak up.”

She then made it habit to share her story of abuse with other women in the slums hoping she could help them open up and share their struggle.

Together with a group of friends, Ms Achieng’ would counsel the women who approached them. The group gave birth to Slum Women Foundation, a non-government organisation championing women’s rights.

It focused on ending intimate partner violence among married couples by making women understand that intimacy also requires consent, married or not.

The forum created a safe space for women to open up and share their stories in order to heal, and create awareness that rape in marriages does exist.

The organisation founded in 2019, would also donate food, sanitary towels and face-masks to women and children during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Initially, she realised that some women were afraid to speak up, they would instead be given papers to anonymously write their concerns without writing their names. This would be followed by counselling, done in groups.

“Our efforts gave birth to the Kisumu Women Writers Association,” says Ms Achieng’.

Battling GBV in Nakuru: Fidelis Wambui’s inspiring story hope in face of challenges,"For five years, Fidelis Wambui Karanja has fought tooth and nail to end discrimination against women and gender-based violence (GBV).

Despite the many verbal insults and threats, Ms Karanja is not about to give up.

Talking to her as one of the heroes in the fight against GBV in Nakuru is like reading a story of hope and willpower.

Ms Karanja’s story is of hope and resilience. She has given girls and women in the slums of Free Area, Bondeni and Kaptembwa tips on protecting themselves from perpetrators of violence.

And it is not just the wretched of the Earth in the slums who are getting the services of Ms Karanja.

A big number of the women she helps are in the middle and upper-classes. Some are professionals who rarely talks about GBV in their homes.

“A majority of middle and upper-class women rarely talk about meted on them by spouses,” she says.

“Marriage is not supposed to be a death sentence. When you feel you’re not being treated like an equal shareholder in the union, the best thing is to seek freedom elsewhere,” she says.

Ms Karanja confidently talks about the highs and lows of her daily work, comparing it like a driver who is sure the vehicle’s tyres remain in contact with the road.

She says the driver must steer the vehicle properly and apply brakes properly, sure that the shock absorbers will work.

It is these “shock absorbers” that Ms Karanja says have kept her going, adding that they have optimally helped to keep women and girls safe.

“Being a shock absorber of women and girls in slums and posh areas who suffer daily violence means you absorb the impact of abuses, disagreements, pain, torture, tears and tension,” she says.

“My greatest joy is when I reduce the tension in the life of a girl or woman by showing her the right way to fight GBV at home, work place or any other place.”

Ms Karanja says she is always ready to absorb the negativity, stress and the anxiety that comes with her work to lessen it for victims of GBV in the cosmopolitan city and surrounding areas.

“I know my life is at times in danger because of the many threats but that will not stop me from advocating for a just society through ending GBV,” stated Ms Karanja who is the founder of Young African Women Initiatives (YAWI), an NGO.

She says her work has had a positive impact on society “as it makes many feel better and comfortable”.

“It is tough to place other people’s needs before yours. That can have an impact on one’s mental health and overall well-being. Because I feel like a shock absorber, the fight against the violence must be sustained,” she added.

Ms Karanja who her upbringing helped shape her perception towards life.

“Domestic violence was the order of the day where I grew up. Because of that, I swore to champion the rights of girls and women on becoming an adult. I am happy to be living my dream,” she says.

The journey has not been easy, she says.

“Some victims are compromised by their tormentors and corrupt administrators like chiefs to withdraw the cases,” Ms Karanja says.

“I can sometimes pursue a GBV case when about to reach the end for the abuser to be apprehended, the victim withdraws.”

And that is not all. Ms Karanja has had to deal with situations in which victims come to the defence of their abusers.

“One woman even told me her abuser was mentally ill and that she had taken the decision to forgive him,” she says.

“This was a nurse who almost died at the hands of her abuser. The man attempted to strangle her with a mosquito net. She was ready to withdraw the case against him despite living on borrowed time.”

Apart from the above challenges, Ms Karanja has had to face accusations of being a home and marriage-breaker.

“Some men blame me for being a homewrecker yet it is their girlfrirends or wives who report these cases to us,” Ms Karanja says.

“They do not choose to report to police but come to YAWI. They are comfortable opening up at YAWI instead of police since we cannot be compromised.”

A woman once sought refuge at YAWI offices when her husband threatened to throw her in a dam for refusing to reveal where she was getting help.

“These kinds of threats are mostly from wealthy husbands who fear being exposed in courts of law,” she says.

Some of the cases YAWI handleS are intriguing. Ms Karanja cites a woman she offered psycho-social support after her husband of 30 years.

“This man was not comfortable with the fact that his wife was not a virgin when they met. The violence against her may not have been physical but was emotional for he kept using unprintable words against her ,” says Ms Karanja.

“This clearly shows many sufferin women have not identified GBV red flags. Victims of GBV – both women and men – should walk out of such unions. They should not be bound by factors like property as that might translate to death.”

The progress Ms Karanja has made in ensuring the right of women and girls to live free from abuse has kept her going.

“I have never felt like I want to quit. I feel great when when people get justice,” she says.

“I will continue stepping on the accelerating pedal to help identify, prevent and remedy violence at home and in the workplace, with a strong focus on gender.”

Her work faces many hurdles, chief among them being delays in courts and police stations.

“Barriers to justice are concentrated in the corridors of justice. It is annoying to see an officer demanding a birth certificate to prove that a 13-year-old girl was raped by a 50-year-old man,” Ms Karanja says.

“Sexual misconduct, assault, child abuse and related crimes do not require a birth certificate for proof.”

"Anti-black racism is rising in EU countries, led by Germany, study finds","Racism towards Black people is growing in Europe, with Germany, Austria and Finland showing the highest rates of discrimination and harassment, a survey of first- and second-generation Black immigrants in 13 EU countries published on Wednesday found.

The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which commissioned the survey and analyzed its findings in a report, said that in the space of six years since the previous study, the proportion of respondents who had felt racially discriminated against in the past 12 months had risen by 10 percentage points to 34%.

In Austria and Germany the proportion was 64% - almost twice the previous level of 33% in Germany and a significant increase from the 42% recorded in Austria six years earlier. The next worst was Finland with 54%.

""It is shocking to see no improvement since our last survey,"" FRA Director Michael O'Flaherty said. ""Instead, people of African descent face ever more discrimination just because of the colour of their skin.""

The proportion of respondents who reported feeling racially discriminated against over the past five years rather than 12 months rose to 45% across the 13 countries surveyed, an increase of six points from the previous study. The top three were the same, with Germany's rate the highest at 76%.

The poll carried out by Ipsos for the FRA was a sweeping survey of 16,124 immigrants and descendants of immigrants across 15 countries from which several FRA reports will be produced - on other ethnic minorities and Muslims. It was conducted between October 2021 and September 2022.

It focuses on 6,752 people born in sub-Saharan Africa or with at least one parent born there living in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

The proportion of respondents who said they had suffered racist harassment in the past five years was unchanged from six years earlier at 30%. The highest national rate was 54% in Germany, followed by Finland and Austria.

Portugal and Sweden were the countries with the lowest rates of harassment and, along with Poland, they had the lowest racial discrimination rates, according to respondents.

The FRA report included a series of recommendations for EU member states such as properly enforcing anti-discrimination legislation and considering a motivation based on racial bias as an aggravating circumstance when setting penalties for crimes.

"Hadzabe, the Tanzanian tribe where women call the shots","Tap! Tap! Tap! A brown antelope calf hops across a smooth graded Karatu-Mang'ola road in Oldeani, a cool area in northern Tanzania covered in maize, sunflower, beans and coffee plantations.

Past Oldeani, it gets hot and windy. It's dusty too. As we get closer, we notice bushes, shrubs and indigenous trees scattered all over.  We are headed to meet the Hadzabe in the depths of forests of Yaeda Valley near Lake Eyasi in the Arusha region.

This hunter-gatherer community has also settled in Serengeti Plateau, on the side of Meatu District in the Simiyu region. The plateau borders Kenya. Others are spread across the forests of Mbulu and Kiteto districts in the Manyara region.

A section of Sonai settlement on June 2, 2023.

The Hadzabe are among about 130 ethnic groups in Tanzania. They are known by different variations—Hadzabi, Hadzane, Hadzape, Hadzapi, Hatsa and Watindiga. In the Kilimanjaro region, for instance, they are known as Watindiga. In Mtwara, they call them Wazabi.

Though Tanzania’s 2022 Census has not provided their population estimates, the United Nations says their numbers range from 1,300 to 1,500, a handful of the 61.7 million Tanzanians.

Endeko Endeko, a member of this community, is helping us locate his people who have settled in the Melekaa area.

There are no roads or signage here to give a sense of direction.

Slight change

Some progress though, the Hadzabe now own mobile phones, which they buy with the money visitors donate to them, or from their beadwork proceeds. The phone signal is, however, poor here.

A display of ornaments the Hadzabe sell to visitors at Sonai settlement, on June 2, 2023.

We access Melekaa from Mang’ola trading centre, a remote business area with only one hotel and a few shops. After diverting onto a bumpy road described as “hiyo barabara ya kwenda kwa wa Hadzabe (that road leading to the Hadzabe),” we manoeuvre through the rocks and shrubs.

We finally arrive at the foot of a huge baobab tree with a cave on its trunk. Before it, is a dusty open field surrounded by more baobabs and shrubs. On the right is a hillock of intimidating boulders resting on each other, forming a somewhat fortification for the community.

Shortly, a man in shorts and a brown sleeveless shirt walks down. Over his shoulder is a beaded skin. His foot is covered with grey tyre sandals and a knife is strapped to his shorts. He holds an arrow. This is Mambosi Jioja, the chairperson of the Sonai Hadzabe group.

The Hadzabe are communal, have a nomadic lifestyle and depend on game meat and wild fruits. For the last 30 years, however, they have never moved from here, Mambosi says. They live behind the hillock. Mambosi leads us up.

As we crawl up, my heart freezes. A slide backward means an early visit to my ancestors. Furthermore, background research informed me that tiger and bark snakes are common here. I wonder if some are lurking under the rocks.

Mambosi is agile. I can't keep up with him. For a few seconds, I stand to catch a breath amid a whiff of nutty-burnt tyre air.

I ask him if a snake has stung anyone in the recent past. His response in the negative is consoling. He says they only bite if provoked. The Hadzabe don't eat snakes as many presume, Mambosi says.

We finally arrive in Sonai, where about 180 Hadzabe have settled in 35 brandy dome huts.

On a log under a towering baobab tree are men crafting sticks with knives to make arrows. A few yards behind them are women sitting on the ground watching over their merchandise lined up on makeshift display structures under the baobab tree.

Necklaces, bangles, earrings, headbands and ornamental gourds hang from the branches and hangers made from cactus, fixed on the tree. I later discover that this baobab tree, in the middle of the settlement, is a landmark serving as a special meeting point for the community.

I greet the men: “Hamjambo? (How are you?).”

I receive a rude response; they just smile and continue sharpening their arrows.

Although this community mainly speaks their native language Hadzabe, their Swahili is fluent. So they heard me. But apparently, I have broken their greeting code.

Mambosi shows me what I am expected to do. Their greeting is special. I shake their hand and say 'mtana' for hello. But the mtana is escorted with some kind of Maasai dance in the form of a rhythmic combination of sounds of kissing, clicking and mumbling like mwaah, knah, mmm, mtana!

Having mastered the art, it becomes easier to greet the women. I request to speak with the women and Katarina Hassan quickly takes the wings.

She welcomes me to her low-height hut built from branches and leaves of indigenous trees. It’s also covered with cream tarpaulin, white sack and canvas, materials left behind by visitors. It has no window—only a door of a coloured shawl.We sit down on a hide of a buffalo, covered with a coloured leso.

“What are the roles of a man and woman in your community?” I ask her.

“His work is to hunt and bring home honey for the family,” she explains. “A woman is to dig up roots and tubers and collect wild fruits.”

The environment has open patches, a clear sign of lost flora to accommodate fauna, their source of livelihood. The changing times has, however, not shifted the community’s expectations as is the case for modern society where women assume roles previously restricted to men.

“Our roles still stand. I can’t go hunting. Neither can he go collecting fruits or tubers; that is my work. That is how it is. That’s a culture passed down to us,” she reckons.

Katarina Hassan digs out a tuber on June 2, 2023.

They have, however, defied the kind of food they eat. She says the harsh weather conditions and conversion of parts of the forest to farms have disturbed the area's ecology, resulting in dwindled production and presence of their wild food.The wild animals they hunted—antelopes, wildebeests, baboons, dik-dik, buffaloes and zebras—have gone missing.

Special status

According to the UN, the Hadzabe are one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer communities on Earth. In Tanzania, it is the only community allowed to source its food through hunting and gathering, says Zakaria Faustin, executive director of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum.

He says Tanzania’s first President Mwalimu Nyerere issued a decree recognising and protecting the community’s special status. The order stands, he says.

But the changing ecosystem threatens their special status. “Whenever they (animals) want to come here, they hear meee, mooo, owh, ting, ting and they run away,” Maliseli Sadiki, a young man who says he is 22, illustrates their frustration with the disappearance of the wild animals.

“These days, you walk for long until you get tired and hunger pangs and thirst overwhelm you. So, you’re forced to excavate tubers to eat. They are succulent and quench your thirst,” says Maliseli, whose dressing is like a billboard of the animals they hunt.

Katarina Hassan holds a tuber on June 2, 2023.

Hanging over his faded black T-shirt and blue knee denim short, are skins and hides of antelope, wildebeest, baboons, dik-dik, buffalo and zebra.

The community has embraced other food. “We eat rice and ugali with vegetables,” says Katarina.

“Usually, visitors bring us maize flour, rice, indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and cooking oil. If anyone gifts us with money, we use it to buy food and distribute it among ourselves.”

Togetherness

Here, nearly everything is done communally. It is the community chairperson who receives any gift on their behalf, including money and food, then he shares it out.

If it’s food, it has to be adequate enough to feed all of them. If it’s water, sourced from a borehole miles away, the money ought to be enough to buy at least one jerrycan of 20 litres for each household at Tsh1,000 (Ksh57.58).

True to Katarina’s submission, during my short time with the community, some foreign tourists gift them with maize flour, assorted indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and some money to buy cooking oil. Mambosi leads the distribution from the baobab tree, the special meeting point.

The women stretch their hands to receive the food. But there is something unique about this whole exercise.

I have witnessed food distribution exercises in Kenya’s Turkana, Baringo and Narok counties and I have never seen a man run to the house to bring a sack to the wife to collect the food. Maybe, I have not been that keen.

Gender power balance is so obvious here. In a generation where UN Women keeps calling for redistribution of household responsibilities, how this community does it is intriguing.

I ask Katarina about the power relations between men and women in their community. “Sisi ni wakali sana kwa wanaume. Sisi ndio tuna uamuzi. Uamuzi ndio wa kwetu. Tukiamua hii, sisi wanawake tumeamua, tusipoamua basi tunaacha (We are more powerful than men. We are the decision-makers and when we decide, our decision is final),” she says.

The power is rooted in marriage culture. Unlike in most cultures across the world where a woman moves into the man’s home once they marry, here, it is the opposite.

“Well, a man woos the woman but she only marries him if he accepts her terms and conditions,” explains Katarina.

“Once he accepts, she builds her house with the support of her mother and other women. The man then joins her. It is her house. Not the man’s,” she says.

The women also determine how much should be paid as reverse dowry. Years ago, they had to bring not less than three baboons, rolls of tobacco and honey, Katarina says.

A section of Sonai settlement.

But these days, due to scarcity of the wild animals, they are allowed to pay in many necklaces, as preferred by the women, and honey.

“The young man will make efforts to find honey, tobacco and necklaces,” explains Mambosi, the Sonai settlement’s chairperson. “The bride’s mother and sister to the groom will only welcome them into the house after the man has fulfilled all the dowry requirements.”

While the women help the bride to construct the house for the incoming husband, the men prepare the groom for his household responsibilities by giving him a honey bag, a skin or hide, knife and arrows, Mambosi says.

So in the case of divorce, the man only leaves with what he came with. That is his only possession. “The children belong to the women. They may have his surname, but it is the women who call the shots,” insists Katarina.

Apalii Saitoti Thufu, Katarina’s husband, proudly acknowledges the power of women here. “If she tells you to leave, you’ll leave. If she allows you to leave with the children then fine,” he says.

In jest, I interject: “But you can refuse to leave.”

He quickly counters: “How can you refuse to go, yet the house is hers. Even if you were to go with the children, where would you host them when you don’t have a house?”

“Is there a problem building a house for yourself and the children?” I ask.

He responds: “No, no! It’s not in our tradition for a man to build a house. That’s the work of women. If she chases you away, you return to your parents. And you’ll just sleep in the open or create some sort of a structure to sleep under.”

Apalii says he was born in Ghorofani, another settlement in Karatu District and moved to Sonai where his wife built a house. Together, they have two children.

I ask Katarina the main reason why women chase away the men and she says: “Kama nimechoka kuchimba mizizi si nitakuwa mkali? (How can I not be rattled if I am bogged down with excavating roots?)”

Maliseli is a victim. He was born here but had a wife in Endamaka, another settlement in Karatu district. They had two children.

But he says he recently returned to his parents, after disagreeing with his wife. She remained with the children. He says he hasn’t seen the children since he left, but given the chance, he can visit them.

He struggled to respond to the query of where he lives. “Mimi naishi kama mimi, kama mimi, kama mimi (As for me, I, I, I live).”

Unlike in many parts of Tanzania and Kenya, where female genital mutilation and child marriages are prevalent, among the Hadzabe, such harmful practices are zero. They are detested. However, girls go through a rite of passage.

A Hadzabe. Girls wear headbands once they begin menstruating.

“If a girl taints her clothes, we will know she has started her menses,” explains Mindi Saitoti, “or if she doesn’t know what’s happening, she will ask her mother.""

""The same day she makes the report, the women contribute beaded necklaces and a headband to decorate her. That shows she is mature.

""But it doesn’t mean she is ready for marriage. If a man intends to marry her, her mother must approve of it and they never do so unless she is above 18 years,” she says.

Mindi is married and has three children. She and her husband, Tabashi Chalesi, were born here. She built a house a few yards away from her parents’ and they live happily.

I am curious to find out if Tabashi finds it strange to live near his in-laws. But it sounds like a weird question.“Strange, how?” he asks.

“We are okay. What is the problem with that?”

I rest my case. Meanwhile, the men have their own way of telling when a woman is ready for marriage.

“You look at the chest. If the breasts are sagging and she has a necklace, you will know she is suitable for marriage,” says Mambosi.

Education

Although the Tanzanian government has made efforts to take its children to school, the Hadzabe who get an education still return to the forest to continue with their cultural lifestyle.

The case of Endeko. He got his secondary education in 2015 and later a diploma in governance and development through a scholarship.

But currently, he lives in his home in Yaeda Chini in Mbulu District in the Manyara region. He says forest life is less stressful.

Zakaria of Tanzania Natural Resources Forum describes the process of modernising the Hadzabe as complicated.“You help them get higher education but they still prefer to go back to the forests,” he notes.

His organisation has previously attempted to help them embrace sustainable means of livelihood but it ended in futility.

“In 2007, we supported them with goats so that they can shift from hunting to keeping goats. But during the dry season, they returned home, shot the goats and ate them,” he says.

"Hadzabe, the Tanzanian tribe where women call the shots","Tap! Tap! Tap! A brown antelope calf hops across a smooth graded Karatu-Mang'ola road in Oldeani, a cool area in northern Tanzania covered in maize, sunflower, beans and coffee plantations.

Past Oldeani, it gets hot and windy. It's dusty too. As we get closer, we notice bushes, shrubs and indigenous trees scattered all over.  We are headed to meet the Hadzabe in the depths of forests of Yaeda Valley near Lake Eyasi in the Arusha region.

This hunter-gatherer community has also settled in Serengeti Plateau, on the side of Meatu District in the Simiyu region. The plateau borders Kenya. Others are spread across the forests of Mbulu and Kiteto districts in the Manyara region.

A section of Sonai settlement on June 2, 2023.

The Hadzabe are among about 130 ethnic groups in Tanzania. They are known by different variations—Hadzabi, Hadzane, Hadzape, Hadzapi, Hatsa and Watindiga. In the Kilimanjaro region, for instance, they are known as Watindiga. In Mtwara, they call them Wazabi.

Though Tanzania’s 2022 Census has not provided their population estimates, the United Nations says their numbers range from 1,300 to 1,500, a handful of the 61.7 million Tanzanians.

Endeko Endeko, a member of this community, is helping us locate his people who have settled in the Melekaa area.

There are no roads or signage here to give a sense of direction.

Slight change

Some progress though, the Hadzabe now own mobile phones, which they buy with the money visitors donate to them, or from their beadwork proceeds. The phone signal is, however, poor here.

A display of ornaments the Hadzabe sell to visitors at Sonai settlement, on June 2, 2023.

We access Melekaa from Mang’ola trading centre, a remote business area with only one hotel and a few shops. After diverting onto a bumpy road described as “hiyo barabara ya kwenda kwa wa Hadzabe (that road leading to the Hadzabe),” we manoeuvre through the rocks and shrubs.

We finally arrive at the foot of a huge baobab tree with a cave on its trunk. Before it, is a dusty open field surrounded by more baobabs and shrubs. On the right is a hillock of intimidating boulders resting on each other, forming a somewhat fortification for the community.

Shortly, a man in shorts and a brown sleeveless shirt walks down. Over his shoulder is a beaded skin. His foot is covered with grey tyre sandals and a knife is strapped to his shorts. He holds an arrow. This is Mambosi Jioja, the chairperson of the Sonai Hadzabe group.

The Hadzabe are communal, have a nomadic lifestyle and depend on game meat and wild fruits. For the last 30 years, however, they have never moved from here, Mambosi says. They live behind the hillock. Mambosi leads us up.

My three-day trek in wilderness to escape abusive marriage,"Having been betrothed to a stranger husband at the age of 11 through an arranged marriage, Evelyn Kiyeny had endured occasional battering that left her weak, at times seeking treatment from health facilities.

The beating is a form of discipline reserved for women who dare defy instructions from their husbands in the patriarchal pastoral society.

The battery became worse after every child birth, when the husband would stagger home drunk, demand for food and if not ready, it translated to an instant battering. It persisted till her fifth child was born.

Unable to bear it any more, she decided to run away from her matrimonial home, but the estranged husband followed her.

“My former husband tried to convince my father that I should go back to his homestead since he had paid the dowry in full. I remained defiant and one day, he came in the company of 11 other men. They pulled me out of the house, took me to a bush and whipped me in turns until I blacked out,” recalls 29-year-old Ms Kiyeny.

Inner voice

She says after the beatings she was unconscious for a while and when she recovered, the men who had retreated some few metres away. Thinking she was dead, they came over, carried her and dumped her at a local health facility at Nginyang Township before disappearing without uttering a word to the medics.

Ms Kiyeny says while at the hospital, she heard an inner voice warning of an imminent danger and commanding her to get out of the health facility and run for safety.

“The only place I knew I had a relative was in Tangulbei Township. Though it was a long distance from our home in Nginyang, I opted to endure the hardships. I slept in the bush hungry but was lucky, the following day, to be offered shelter by a Good Samaritan,” she explains through an interpreter since she has never stepped in a classroom.

For three days, she trekked through the wilderness of Baringo County to escape from an abusive marriage she had persevered for 15 years.

She was literally running away from death, having a few days earlier experienced a severe beating by 12 men who left her half dead.

On arriving at her relative’s place, hungry, sickly and exhausted, she was taken to hospital where she was admitted for a week.

Through support from a women network, which has more than 2,800 members spread across Tiaty East Sub-county, she has managed to pick up the pieces, reunited with her children and now operates a grocery shop at Tangulbei Township.

The Action Aid project has helped her gain economic empowerment and is aware of her rights. She is actively involved in campaign on women rights through Village Savings and Lending Association (VSLA) groups where women meet weekly for a community savings and lending scheme.

Many women and girls in her Pokot community remain victims of the deep-rooted culture that subject them to inhuman treatment.

Many have been rescued from forced marriage by the women network.

“We desperately need a rescue centre in each of the six sub-counties in Baringo if the fight against retrogressive cultural practice that adversely affect the lives of Pokot girls has to be won,” says Ms Charity Lemejan, the vice secretary to Tangulbei Women Network.

Hostile and violent

“Girls are being abused day in day out. We have few children protection officers in the county with one serving three expansive sub-counties. At times, rescue missions abort since the community turns hostile and violent,” says Irene Chepkoi, a children officer based at Kabarnet Town.

The county also lacks enough charitable children institutions where rescued girls can be housed for safety, care and access education.

Ms Chepkoi says they are collaborating with other stakeholders to train child protection volunteers who can sensitise community at the villages and also report cases of child abuse.

“We have been supported by Action Aid to train volunteers based at the villages to educate the community and monitor cases of child abuse, since women who should be vocal about this vice, still believe it’s acceptable. Another approach we are using is reaching out to the community through community radio stations to educate the public on the rights of a child and how he or she can be protected,” she explains.

“My former husband tried to convince my father that I should go back to his homestead since he had paid the dowry in full. I remained defiant and one day, he came in the company of 11 other men. They pulled me out of the house, took me to a bush and whipped me in turns until I blacked out,” recalls 29-year-old Ms Kiyeny.

Inner voice

She says after the beatings she was unconscious for a while and when she recovered, the men who had retreated some few metres away. Thinking she was dead, they came over, carried her and dumped her at a local health facility at Nginyang Township before disappearing without uttering a word to the medics.

Ms Kiyeny says while at the hospital, she heard an inner voice warning of an imminent danger and commanding her to get out of the health facility and run for safety.

“The only place I knew I had a relative was in Tangulbei Township. Though it was a long distance from our home in Nginyang, I opted to endure the hardships. I slept in the bush hungry but was lucky, the following day, to be offered shelter by a Good Samaritan,” she explains through an interpreter since she has never stepped in a classroom.

For three days, she trekked through the wilderness of Baringo County to escape from an abusive marriage she had persevered for 15 years.

She was literally running away from death, having a few days earlier experienced a severe beating by 12 men who left her half dead.

On arriving at her relative’s place, hungry, sickly and exhausted, she was taken to hospital where she was admitted for a week.

Through support from a women network, which has more than 2,800 members spread across Tiaty East Sub-county, she has managed to pick up the pieces, reunited with her children and now operates a grocery shop at Tangulbei Township.

The Action Aid project has helped her gain economic empowerment and is aware of her rights. She is actively involved in campaign on women rights through Village Savings and Lending Association (VSLA) groups where women meet weekly for a community savings and lending scheme.

Many women and girls in her Pokot community remain victims of the deep-rooted culture that subject them to inhuman treatment.

Many have been rescued from forced marriage by the women network.

“We desperately need a rescue centre in each of the six sub-counties in Baringo if the fight against retrogressive cultural practice that adversely affect the lives of Pokot girls has to be won,” says Ms Charity Lemejan, the vice secretary to Tangulbei Women Network.

Hostile and violent

“Girls are being abused day in day out. We have few children protection officers in the county with one serving three expansive sub-counties. At times, rescue missions abort since the community turns hostile and violent,” says Irene Chepkoi, a children officer based at Kabarnet Town.

The county also lacks enough charitable children institutions where rescued girls can be housed for safety, care and access education.

Ms Chepkoi says they are collaborating with other stakeholders to train child protection volunteers who can sensitise community at the villages and also report cases of child abuse.

“We have been supported by Action Aid to train volunteers based at the villages to educate the community and monitor cases of child abuse, since women who should be vocal about this vice, still believe it’s acceptable. Another approach we are using is reaching out to the community through community radio stations to educate the public on the rights of a child and how he or she can be protected,” she explains.

Ending GBV starts with teaching boys and girls about consent,"The fight against sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) can be won with proper upbringing of girls and boys, gender equality advocates say.

Miss Universe, 2019 and gender equality advocate Ms Zozibini Tunzi said normalising violence during childhood permeates into adulthood when it becomes worse.

“When you have pre-school boy and girl playing and the boy beats up the girl, the first thing that people say is ‘don’t worry. Oh he likes her?’” she said during a December 4, Fighting a Shadow Pandemic webinar convened by Foreign Policy.

“This is where it (violence against women and girls) begins. You are subconsciously teaching this young boy that love is violence. You are also teaching this young girl that to be loved is to be violated,” she added.

She said, boys and girls should be nurtured into understanding principles of gender equality. With the knowledge, the boys will respect and value the rights of girls and vice versa, she said.

“Start teaching girls and boys about consent (and) boundaries. We have to start today creating an army of men that we want to see in future,” she said.

Comprehensive data lacking

UN Women representative in South Africa, Ms Anne Githuku-Shongwe, identified lack of comprehensive data as a critical barrier to tackling SGBV.

“One of the challenges we have with data is the fact that less than 40 per cent of women report violence (and yet they are the main sources of data),” she said.

“We tend not to know what is really happening in terms of violence from country to country unless there is a full national prevalence survey,” she added.

In South Africa, she said, femicide stands at 12.5 deaths per 100,000 women which has earned its identities such as murder or rape capital of the world.

Globally, 137 women are killed every day with 50 per cent of murders committed by intimate partners thus implying that homes are not safe for women, she said.

Black Women Caucus, founder and chairperson, Ms Fatimata Moutloatse said rise in student movements has revolutionised anti-SGBV campaigns to bring to attention sexual harassment in higher learning institutions previously under the wrap.

Let’s talk! Confronting the age-old problem of sexual harassment,"Early February, 23-year-old Esther*, started her two-month internship at a broadcast media company in Nairobi.

She is a Media and Communication student at a local university where she majored in electronic media. Two weeks into her internship, the company’s head of production, a male in his early 30s, started making unwelcome sexual moves on her.

“Every time, he was around me, he could tell me I have a nice body and that he could not wait to have me in his bed,” she shares.

“At first, I laughed it off. But the comments kept coming. He could call me in the middle of the night and tell me how he missed me, yet he and I were in the office, the whole time.”

This went on for about a week until she felt it was about time to make it clear that she wasn’t interested in his sex innuendos.

Incidentally, both had plans to confront each other on the same day. She arrived at the office, ready to speak her mind, only for him to come to her desk, grab her hand and pull her to an outdoor garden.

“I want to have sex with you. So when is that happening?” he asked her.

Esther says she was shocked by his outright demand.

“I told him I respect myself so much that I cannot sleep with him for just a night and walk away like nothing happened,” she says.

From then, he started avoiding her and could not assign her any roles. She spent sleepless nights wondering what her next move should be, having been cut off from gaining practical experience. She reached out to a female colleague.

It is a small-scale company with less than 10 employees, she says.

Her response was even more depressing: “He is known for that behaviour and there is nothing you can do. We don’t have guidelines on who to report to when that happens. Just let it go.”

It was until she threatened to tell his wife of his unprofessional behaviour that he changed and resumed treating her professionally – sending her out for assignments and according her the necessary support in line of duty.

Esther’s experience is a definitive example of quid pro quo harassment, a form of sexual harassment in which employment decisions are made based on an employee’s acceptance or rejection of unwelcome sexual behaviour. In this case, the head of department withdrawing his supervisory role on her because she declined his demand for sexual relations.

Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women defines sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Sexual harassment is not limited to office space. It happens everywhere – from formal to informal interactions; in the online and offline spaces.

It happens on social media, markets, supermarkets, gyms, hotels, salons, tea buying centres, churches, banking halls or on the road as one heads to the shop or the river. The list is long.

In Kenya, sexual harassment is a criminal offence. Clause 23 of the Sexual Offences Act (2006) prohibits any person in authority or holding a public office from making sexual advances or requests. Such a person is liable to a minimum three-year jail term or penalty of not less than Sh100,000.

The Act further criminalises other forms of sexual harassment such as sexual assault, attempted rape and indecent acts. These offences attract a five to a 10-year jail term.

Busia Woman Representative Ms Florence Mutua had through her Sexual Offences (Amendment), 2016 sought to further specify forms of sexual harassment.

She wanted “any contact between any part of the body of a person with the genital organs, breasts or buttocks of another …and exposure or display (of the same) or pornographic material to any person against his or her will,” to be criminalised. The bill failed to get the legislators’ approval.

On the other hand, previously under the Employment Act (2007), only companies with more than 20 employees were bound by law to have a sexual harassment policy.

But now, the Employment (Amendment) Act, 2019, demands of firms with more than five employees to have the policy. It should clearly state that each employee is entitled to employment that is free of sexual harassment, how to report the offences and redress measures thereof.

Scanty statistics

Despite the existence of anti-sexual harassment laws, the reality of women and men becoming victims is evident.

Scanty statistics are available on offline sexual harassment. The media has, however, captured such cases. For instance, last year, a police officer in Nakuru was caught on camera pulling a suspect’s genitals in an attempt to force him to board a waiting police vehicle.

For online, studies on digital security have shown prevalence of sexual harassment. A 2016 joint survey by Association of Media Women in Kenya (Amwik) and Article 19 Eastern Africa established that some 75 per cent of female journalists in Kenya have suffered online harassment, these included sexual harassment.

Available evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other, an indication of either the public’s ignorance or disillusionment.

It is possible to successfully litigate a sexual harassment offence.

In 2017, a Kericho Employment and Labour Relations court awarded a female clinical officer Sh600,000 as general damages for sexual harassment. In case 53 of 2017, the officer had sued her manager for sexual advances. She declined, a decision she argued to have prompted him to end her employment at the health facility.

Diamond Trust Bank, Head of HR Ms Lillian Ngala, says a human resource officer is obliged to take action against claims of sexual harassment.

Ignoring the complaints

The aggrieved member of the staff must, however, provide proof to the claim, which can be in form of emails, calls, texts or colleagues to whom one has confided.

Ignoring the complaints could be tantamount to abetting sexual harassment in the workplace, a conduct that can lead to one losing certificate of practice with Institute of Human Resource Management, she says.

She observes that annual sensitisation of staff through strategies such as refresher courses and email reminders, are crucial to eliminating breeding ground for sexual harassment.

Eagle HR Consultants Chief Executive Officer, Mr Patrick Mutisya, adds that an employee has a right to seek justice through the court if the employer fails to take action within 14 days of notice.

“The person who fails to take action is actually a collaborator (in abetting the offence),”says Mr Mutisya.

But to successfully prosecute such as case, one needs to provide concrete evidence such as an email or a letter, he advises.

Federation of Women Lawyers-Kenya (Fida-Kenya) Legal Counsel, Ms Vivian Mwende says “when it comes to sexual harassment, the burden of proof lies with the person who is claiming sexual harassment.”

Labour Policy Consultant at Learn Africa Solutions, Mr Alphonce Were says employers must purpose to educate their employees to avoid normalising sexual harassment.

“Employees should be aware that sexual statements about their body parts are not normal jokes,” he says.

This is my story...Sabina Chege

In March 2018, Murang’a Woman Representative Ms Sabina Chege, found herself in the middle of a storm.

An alleged conman, Benson Chacha was using her number to solicit money from Cabinet Secretaries and her fellow MPs in addition to sending the MPs sexually explicit messages.

Ms Chege together with 13 other female MPs reported the harassment to Parliament Police Station. When Directorate of Criminal Investigations, director Mr George Kinoti appeared before the National Assembly Committee on National Security to shed light on investigations of the matter, he said he had concluded that “there is special relation between the complainants and the suspect.”

This opened the floor for online sexual harassment against Ms Chege with a Twitter account even opened using her photo and that of the suspect, and using an implicating username. The account is still active to-date.

Later, the DCI refuted the “special relation” statement but the damage was already done on the part of Ms Chege.

The harassment was “a worst case scenario,” Ms Chege says.

“It is really sad even the way the police handled the matter. We are still in court. The court has delayed the case till to-day. If somebody at my level can be treated that way, what about an ordinary woman?” she wonders.

For nominated Member of the Nairobi County Assembly Ms Silvia Museiya, being spammed with sexually suggestive conversations on her phone and social media accounts is common.

“I just ignore,” she says, “The moment you start indulging, it becomes a back and forth issue. There is an assumption that women in leadership have used sex to get up, and so the best way to handle it is to prove that you have a mind of your own, and that you are confident in your own space, and men can read that very easily.”

Unsafe behind the wheel: An Uber driver and her ‘sexual advances’ journey

Women taxi drivers face the same security concerns as male drivers; however, they additionally face gender-dominated forms of victimisation.

Peris Wangari Wanjiku, an Uber driver, recalls a time she picked a client in Langa’ta who wanted to go to Kahawa West. On their way, Ms Wanjiku says the client, who had been talkative for most of the trip disclosed he had no place to go and requested her to spend the night with him in the car.

As an act of kindness, and to avoid a confrontation, she decided to park her car at a petrol station along Thika Road, the safest place she could think of, until dawn.

For her, working as a taxi driver in Nairobi has been the most enjoyable and rewarding form of employment but it has come with a fair share of challenges.

Ms Wanjiku says most of her male clients make sexual advances at her and it does not amuse her anymore because she knows how to handle such behaviour. Some ask her for a date, while others make uninvited remarks.

Many of her male clients, she reveals, start hitting on her the moment they start the journey. They will tell her how beautiful she is and request for a date.

On average, five out of every 10 male clients, she says, make sexual advances at her.This, she says, mostly happens at night when ferrying inebriated clients, with both young and old clients making unwelcome advances in equal measure.

“Many start telling me they want to take me for coffee and get to know me because they are having issues with either their girlfriends or wives. They will shower me with compliments, saying they like aggressive and hard-working women like me, and not their lazy wives and girlfriends,” she says.

Keen not to bring an argument or a misunderstanding in the course of their journey, Ms Wanjiku says she plays along and remains polite until they reach their destination. They then strike a deal that they talk over the phone the following day, as a gesture of politeness.

“Many of them will call the following day and that is when I tell them I am married and a family woman who is only in business to fend for my family,” she says.

One time, she says, she got a request from a man of Chinese origin. When they got to their destination, she says the Chinese man looked at her, gave her some extra money and told her to go home and cook for the children.

Ms Wanjiku reveals that in her kind of business, she can only be polite to the male clients lest she losses business. What she ensures is that she does not allow the advances to go beyond limits.

Despite the sexual advances, she says male clients are usually very friendly, generous and has never encountered a violent one.

A gym instructor, his female clients and the limits

The gym is a great place for rejuvenating the body and mind. It can, however, be an intimidating and daunting place, making one feel vulnerable.

Like many other environments, it is prone to sexual harassment with the most common types including being unnecessarily stared at, indecent touch, having one’s personal space invaded without invitation, and unnecessary comments about appearance.

The gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client.

The gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client. This is where the thin line between upholding professionalism and managing emotional attachment that comes with hours, weeks, months and even years of an instructor training one client comes in.

Studies show that women are the most sexually harassed in the gym, but men too, are prone to harassment.

Arnold Opuka*, a gym instructor in Kisumu, is alive to this fact. When we meet him at his place of work, he tells The Voice that he has also been a victim of sexual harassment.

Suggestive comments about their physique abound, with women referring to them as hunks, and suggesting which parts of their bodies the instructor should touch as they train.

""Many of these women, aged between 35 and 55 years, have money and easily influence young instructors. Some have fallen victims and lost their jobs,"" says Mr Opuka.

He reveals that the women are tactful, only giving glances with limited open expressions of their desire for someone. This, he says, requires a keen eye to notice the advances.

At times, especially during stretching exercises, some will do the routines suggestively.

He, however, reveals that the actual sexual advances happen during private sessions.

""The women are more open and tempt instructors by the manner in which they act around you,"" says the 31-year-old.

He adds that when these women come to the gym, their eyes are not only trained on the instructors, but also the young well-built men who work out in the gym.

While most of these incidences appear consensual, he maintains that it is wrong and can be avoided, warning his colleagues against according specific clients special attention as that is bound to build attachment.

""Women are a jealous lot and that is why you have to treat all of them equally. Smile with all, psyche and assist all, and above all, be professional,” says Mr Opuka.

As an act of kindness, and to avoid a confrontation, she decided to park her car at a petrol station along Thika Road, the safest place she could think of, until dawn.

For her, working as a taxi driver in Nairobi has been the most enjoyable and rewarding form of employment but it has come with a fair share of challenges.

Ms Wanjiku says most of her male clients make sexual advances at her and it does not amuse her anymore because she knows how to handle such behaviour. Some ask her for a date, while others make uninvited remarks.

Many of her male clients, she reveals, start hitting on her the moment they start the journey. They will tell her how beautiful she is and request for a date.

On average, five out of every 10 male clients, she says, make sexual advances at her.This, she says, mostly happens at night when ferrying inebriated clients, with both young and old clients making unwelcome advances in equal measure.

“Many start telling me they want to take me for coffee and get to know me because they are having issues with either their girlfriends or wives. They will shower me with compliments, saying they like aggressive and hard-working women like me, and not their lazy wives and girlfriends,” she says.

Keen not to bring an argument or a misunderstanding in the course of their journey, Ms Wanjiku says she plays along and remains polite until they reach their destination. They then strike a deal that they talk over the phone the following day, as a gesture of politeness.

“Many of them will call the following day and that is when I tell them I am married and a family woman who is only in business to fend for my family,” she says.

One time, she says, she got a request from a man of Chinese origin. When they got to their destination, she says the Chinese man looked at her, gave her some extra money and told her to go home and cook for the children.

Ms Wanjiku reveals that in her kind of business, she can only be polite to the male clients lest she losses business. What she ensures is that she does not allow the advances to go beyond limits.

Despite the sexual advances, she says male clients are usually very friendly, generous and has never encountered a violent one.

A gym instructor, his female clients and the limits

The gym is a great place for rejuvenating the body and mind. It can, however, be an intimidating and daunting place, making one feel vulnerable.

Like many other environments, it is prone to sexual harassment with the most common types including being unnecessarily stared at, indecent touch, having one’s personal space invaded without invitation, and unnecessary comments about appearance.

The gym involves a lot of close contact between the instructor and the client. This is where the thin line between upholding professionalism and managing emotional attachment that comes with hours, weeks, months and even years of an instructor training one client comes in.

Studies show that women are the most sexually harassed in the gym, but men too, are prone to harassment.

Arnold Opuka*, a gym instructor in Kisumu, is alive to this fact. When we meet him at his place of work, he tells The Voice that he has also been a victim of sexual harassment.

Suggestive comments about their physique abound, with women referring to them as hunks, and suggesting which parts of their bodies the instructor should touch as they train.

""Many of these women, aged between 35 and 55 years, have money and easily influence young instructors. Some have fallen victims and lost their jobs,"" says Mr Opuka.

He reveals that the women are tactful, only giving glances with limited open expressions of their desire for someone. This, he says, requires a keen eye to notice the advances.

At times, especially during stretching exercises, some will do the routines suggestively.

He, however, reveals that the actual sexual advances happen during private sessions.

""The women are more open and tempt instructors by the manner in which they act around you,"" says the 31-year-old.

He adds that when these women come to the gym, their eyes are not only trained on the instructors, but also the young well-built men who work out in the gym.

While most of these incidences appear consensual, he maintains that it is wrong and can be avoided, warning his colleagues against according specific clients special attention as that is bound to build attachment.

""Women are a jealous lot and that is why you have to treat all of them equally. Smile with all, psyche and assist all, and above all, be professional,” says Mr Opuka.

How much is reasonable bride price? Lessons from Tana River man’s Sh7,"When Hussein Charo from Tana River County asked for only Sh7 as bride price in December last year, he did not only baffle his guests, he also scaled national news because the action defied popular practice of turning such occasions into income-generating activities.

This was the second time Charo acted “strangely”. When his first daughter got married, he asked only for prayer beads, saying he was more interested in his son-in-law’s integrity than wealth.

This behaviour raises questions about bride price. Why do we consider it mandatory? How does it affect the status of women relative to men in marriage? What is women’s say about it? How much is reasonable and how much is not? Who is the primary beneficiary?

Prospective children

The consideration takes the form of livestock, money, foodstuff, utensils, other material items and even labour, depending on the community. Two scholars, John S. Mbiti and Isaac Osabutey-Aguedze, aver that bride price was traditionally to cement inter-familial relationships, express gratitude for the girl’s upbringing, ‘compensate’ for the transferred labour, demonstrate the man’s willingness to enter into a marriage and signal his ability to take care of the wife and prospective children. The gifts were reminders of the maiden’s physical absence and signified her value to the maiden and marital families.

No one should begrudge individuals from continuing with the practice as the Constitution of Kenya embeds the right to one’s culture. The Marriage Act (2014) also recognises the practice but requires it to be only a token to formalise customary unions.

From a gender perspective, bride-price is a patriarchal relic that subjugates women. In the first instance, the negotiations are male affairs even though the subject matter is a woman.

In fact, the bride does not even share in the payment or have a say on how it is used. In the second, men paying it (some under duress) wait to recover their pound of flesh through dominance over their wives citing the power assigned to them by the bride price. This is evident in cases where men count their wives as part of their property.

Dysfunctional unions

In some communities, women are subjected to insults insinuating that their level of intelligence is equal to that of the animals paid for them! Also, the understanding that the bride price is recovered should the marriage break down puts pressure on women to tolerate dysfunctional unions to protect the parents from the imminent loss.

Bride price has today become so steep, it is basically a captive wealth generating activity for the bride’s family, technically the paternal side, and a burdensome tax on men. In many cases, the price is based on the bride’s level of formal education and career. The higher the two, the more the expectation, as evident in the October 2019 case in Meru where a man demanded Sh1 million, to the chagrin of the Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders, which in turn vowed to draft a law standardising the payment in their area of jurisdiction.

An anecdote from one nuptial experience has it that a medical doctor went to pay bride price for his partner, also a doctor. But the father-in-law made it clear that the amount paid was not commensurate with his daughter’s status. The groom apologised but gave his father-in-law a piece of poetic justice. He asked him to replace her with one equivalent to his means!

Nuptial ceremonies

Simply put, placing a price on a bride commercialises marriage, objectifies women and transforms them into wares for sale, in the same way as done in ancient Russia where they were called Kunka, derived from Kuna (marten), the currency of payment.

A cursory look reveals that nuptial ceremonies today are more of exhibitions of financial, material and vehicular grandeur than anything else. This is evident in comments equating success with the number of guests and expensive cars in attendance. This not only puts pressure on men, it also diverts attention from the primary purpose of marriage.

From the deep entrenchment of the practice, any suggestion to outlaw it would be opposed by both men and women, the former because this would disrobe them of power and the latter because it is probably the only expression of appreciation they and their parents are assured of.

Gender equality

Mr Charo’s action, comical as it looks, is a reminder that we should re-examine bride price in light of gender equality. Standardising the payment might appear like interference with personal choice.

However, it will return some sanity and redeem the practice from the financially draining monster it has become. It is also time we replaced the term ‘bride price’ with ‘gifts’ to remove the commercial connotation. The Njuri Ncheke also owes us an update on the draft law.

"Like Scotland, Kenya can end period poverty","Menstruation is an uncomfortable, painful, inconvenient and expensive experience for many women and girls. It occurs once a month for approximately three to seven days; about three months a year.

Those with no access to menstruation products are left to their own devices to manage their menstruation cycles, with many unable to participate meaningfully in daily life due to the difficulty of managing bleeding.

Many girls resort to using unhygienic substitutes such as rags, newspapers, banana leaves, and even cow dung. Worse still, others turn to prostitution to get these essential products.

Unfortunately, period poverty – the lack of access to menstrual products – increases the risk of toxic shock syndrome, cervical cancer and other dangerous infections according to research.

While period poverty has always been the stark reality for some, Covid-19 has exacerbated menstruation-related challenges, especially for women and girls from urban slums and poor rural communities.

Menstrual hygiene

Globally, women and girls’ rights activists are asking governments to integrate sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls in Covid-19 responses. In Kenya, at least 2.6 million girls currently require menstrual hygiene materials – pads, underwear and soap, according to Unesco.

In April last year, local women rights organisations petitioned the government to spend at least 30 per cent share of Covid-19 funds on gender responsive strategies including distributing cash relief, food and sanitary towels to vulnerable women and girls.

The pandemic aside, the menstrual hygiene situation in Kenya has been, and remains dire. Thousands of adolescent girls have to contend with hurdles as they go through formal schooling. In September last year, a school girl in Bomet committed suicide after her teacher humiliated her for staining her uniform during her menses.

It is sad this happened nine years after Kenya launched the Sanitary Towels Programme in 2011 – an initiative meant to provide pads to needy girls in public schools. It is the same year Kenya made sanitary towels tax-free.

Unfortunately, some girls do not receive the free sanitary towels. The government in 2019, admitted a lack of funds to provide sanitary towels as required by law, with Education CS George Magoha saying the Sh470 million provided can only supply girls for four months.

Lack of access to sanitary products means many girls drop out of school while on their period, putting them at greater risk of child marriage and early pregnancy.

In 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Basic Education Amendment Act (2016) placing the responsibility of providing free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels on the government, to reduce the number of girls missing school.

In 2019, the government launched the Menstrual Hygiene Policy 2019-30 to among other things, ensure women and girls have access to safe and hygienic products.

All these measures were aimed at ending period poverty. However, that goal is yet to be met with Education CS last year admitting that the government scheme had not met its target, and many girls are still missing school during their menses.

Disadvantaged girl

The United Nations estimates that as many as 20 million girls drop out of schools (globally) every year because they cannot deal with their menstrual flows. The Education ministry estimates that a girl absent from school for four days a month loses 13 learning days equivalent to two weeks per term.

This means that in an academic year, a disadvantaged girl loses up to 39 learning days, something that could be remedied by proper implementation of the sanitary towels program.

Access to sanitary products would also be of limited help if schools don’t have the supporting infrastructure, such as separate bathrooms for girls with doors and locks for privacy, a luxury in most of our rural public schools.

Menstruation is a global issue and there is evidence of action to address its challenges. Last year, Scotland became the first country in the world to provide free period products for all women, while Germany reduced tax on sanitary towels from 19 per cent to seven per cent.

Canada, Australia and India followed suit. France, Spain, Poland and Austria have also lowered tax on sanitary products. A handful of US States have also passed laws mandating free period products be provided in schools. The UK government too, rolled out free period products in all primary and secondary schools in England last year.

Kenya’s menstrual policies all look good on paper, but wouldn’t work in a real-world environment if not managed well. With proper management, we too, like Scotland, can make sanitary products free for all. Every woman is entitled to safe and hygienic menstrual facilities, and the right to manage menstruation without shame or stigma.

It is time to change the narrative, girls and women have suffered enough.

"From the US to Lesotho, Covid-19 crushed women's hopes as global supply chains came tumbling down","In her last weeks working the freight shift at the local J.C. Penney store, Alexandra Orozco took out her phone and hit record. The 22-year-old shot a video of the giant black-and-red ’Everything Must go!” posters, and posted it on TikTok in October.

“Slowly losing my job,” she wrote below, days before the store in Delano, California shut for good, one of 156 J.C. Penney stores across the United States to close since June of last year.

Since being laid off, she has applied for a couple of roles – counselling kids, delivering flowers – but has yet to hear back. “It’s so sad,” she explains over the phone.

“And it’s hard to find jobs here.”

Halfway across the world, Matefo Litali experienced upheaval, too. A skilled sewer, the 53-year-old worked at Tzicc Clothing, apparel-maker for US-based giants J.C. Penney and Walmart, in Lesotho, a small mountainous country surrounded by South Africa. She was employed for two months before nationwide lock-down measures forced all garment factories to temporarily close in March. After two days back at work, Tzicc confirmed her last day was May 7, 2020.

“I felt powerless,” she says.

“The first thing that went through my mind was, ‘Why me?” Neither woman has met. Nor are they likely to; one lives in a remote agricultural town on the west coast of America, the other 10,000 miles away in Southern Africa.

Supply chains

Now, both of their lives – and livelihoods – are linked by a global pandemic that has crushed one of the world’s supply chains and with it, economies, too.

Covid-19 lock-downs have obliterated a retail sector already struggling to survive before the coronavirus hit, which has in turn, contributed to the collapse of the global garment trade and wreaked havoc for millions of workers, the vast majority being women like Ms Orozco and Ms Litali.

Over the past two decades Lesotho’s garment industry, where nine out of 10 workers are women, has boomed to become its largest employer, crafting clothes for Levis Strauss, Wrangler and Walmart.

While Lesotho is a lesser-known garment powerhouse compared to China or Bangladesh, it is another example of an economy heavily reliant on US demand. Outside of the African continent, America is the largest recipient of Lesotho’s exports – accounting for almost half –according to the most recently available World Trade Organisation data from 2017.In the US, meanwhile, clothing retailers have been hit particularly hard. The country is one of the world’s top importers of clothing, accounting for nearly a quarter of global retail spend.

While J.C. Penney hasn’t been profitable since 2010, the 118-year-old chain filed for bankruptcy in May last year. Six months later, it was bought out but its workforce was slashed by more than 10,000 during restructuring, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to The Fuller Project.

US retailers

J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers also filed for bankruptcy this year. “And when a big US retailer takes a tumble,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, “the effects are felt across the globe.”

Last March, as US retailers cancelled or failed to pay for existing orders worth billions of dollars, the effects quickly rippled down the supply chain. At Tzicc Clothing, roughly one fifth of employees have lost their jobs since May last year, says Tšepang Makakole of Lesotho’s National Clothing and Textile Workers Union. ""For women, it’s a disaster...The industry is facing a total collapse.”

Ms Litali felt weak in the knees when she heard that she was suddenly unemployed. A widow for the last eight years, the seamstress single-handedly supports her youngest daughter, who is 20, and her four-year-old grandchild.

During the lock-down, her employer delayed her final $94 (Sh10,000) pay check for three months until May. The Human Resources manager at Tzicc Clothing, Masefatsa Mofolo, confirmed the company laid off staff due to limited orders. For months, Ms Litali received no income or support, instead surviving off donated food from the local church until her final salary arrived.

J.C. Penney

“I got so stressed; I thought I was going mad,” she says. “I would spend the whole day sleeping.”

Back in California, Ms Orozco occasionally walks past the town’s J.C. Penney. The windows are free from sale signs, the gates locked.

“I was close to the cleaning lady who worked there,” she says. “It broke my heart to know I probably won’t ever see her again.” A spokesperson for J.C. Penney declined to comment on the closures.

Although Ms Orozco lives with her parents, she still has car and phone bills. When her store closed temporarily in mid-March in adherence with Covid-19 measures, she was out of work for three months and applied for unemployment.

She used the time to finesse her side-hustle: a make-up business, selling lashes, lip glosses and clothes via Instagram.

She earns roughly $200-300 (Sh21,000-33,000) per month in sales, nearly five times less than her salary at J.C. Penney.

Today, both Ms Litali and Ms Orozco’s lives look uncertain. In August, Litali landed a job sewing jeans at another factory, but she fears her temporary contract won’t be renewed. By next year, Orozco hopes to have saved enough to open a brick-and-mortar store. “It’s stressful but… I know one day it will be worth it.”

Halfway across the world, Matefo Litali experienced upheaval, too. A skilled sewer, the 53-year-old worked at Tzicc Clothing, apparel-maker for US-based giants J.C. Penney and Walmart, in Lesotho, a small mountainous country surrounded by South Africa. She was employed for two months before nationwide lock-down measures forced all garment factories to temporarily close in March. After two days back at work, Tzicc confirmed her last day was May 7, 2020.

“I felt powerless,” she says.

“The first thing that went through my mind was, ‘Why me?” Neither woman has met. Nor are they likely to; one lives in a remote agricultural town on the west coast of America, the other 10,000 miles away in Southern Africa.

Supply chains

Now, both of their lives – and livelihoods – are linked by a global pandemic that has crushed one of the world’s supply chains and with it, economies, too.

Covid-19 lock-downs have obliterated a retail sector already struggling to survive before the coronavirus hit, which has in turn, contributed to the collapse of the global garment trade and wreaked havoc for millions of workers, the vast majority being women like Ms Orozco and Ms Litali.

Over the past two decades Lesotho’s garment industry, where nine out of 10 workers are women, has boomed to become its largest employer, crafting clothes for Levis Strauss, Wrangler and Walmart.

While Lesotho is a lesser-known garment powerhouse compared to China or Bangladesh, it is another example of an economy heavily reliant on US demand. Outside of the African continent, America is the largest recipient of Lesotho’s exports – accounting for almost half –according to the most recently available World Trade Organisation data from 2017.In the US, meanwhile, clothing retailers have been hit particularly hard. The country is one of the world’s top importers of clothing, accounting for nearly a quarter of global retail spend.

While J.C. Penney hasn’t been profitable since 2010, the 118-year-old chain filed for bankruptcy in May last year. Six months later, it was bought out but its workforce was slashed by more than 10,000 during restructuring, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to The Fuller Project.

US retailers

J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers also filed for bankruptcy this year. “And when a big US retailer takes a tumble,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, “the effects are felt across the globe.”

Last March, as US retailers cancelled or failed to pay for existing orders worth billions of dollars, the effects quickly rippled down the supply chain. At Tzicc Clothing, roughly one fifth of employees have lost their jobs since May last year, says Tšepang Makakole of Lesotho’s National Clothing and Textile Workers Union. ""For women, it’s a disaster...The industry is facing a total collapse.”

Ms Litali felt weak in the knees when she heard that she was suddenly unemployed. A widow for the last eight years, the seamstress single-handedly supports her youngest daughter, who is 20, and her four-year-old grandchild.

During the lock-down, her employer delayed her final $94 (Sh10,000) pay check for three months until May. The Human Resources manager at Tzicc Clothing, Masefatsa Mofolo, confirmed the company laid off staff due to limited orders. For months, Ms Litali received no income or support, instead surviving off donated food from the local church until her final salary arrived.

J.C. Penney

“I got so stressed; I thought I was going mad,” she says. “I would spend the whole day sleeping.”

Back in California, Ms Orozco occasionally walks past the town’s J.C. Penney. The windows are free from sale signs, the gates locked.

“I was close to the cleaning lady who worked there,” she says. “It broke my heart to know I probably won’t ever see her again.” A spokesperson for J.C. Penney declined to comment on the closures.

Although Ms Orozco lives with her parents, she still has car and phone bills. When her store closed temporarily in mid-March in adherence with Covid-19 measures, she was out of work for three months and applied for unemployment.

She used the time to finesse her side-hustle: a make-up business, selling lashes, lip glosses and clothes via Instagram.

She earns roughly $200-300 (Sh21,000-33,000) per month in sales, nearly five times less than her salary at J.C. Penney.

Today, both Ms Litali and Ms Orozco’s lives look uncertain. In August, Litali landed a job sewing jeans at another factory, but she fears her temporary contract won’t be renewed. By next year, Orozco hopes to have saved enough to open a brick-and-mortar store. “It’s stressful but… I know one day it will be worth it.”

Women must shun the conduct of stereotyping female politicians,"Charity Ngilu, the second governor of Kitui County and one of the two elected women county bosses, thrust herself into Kenya’s presidential race after being in politics for barely five years, as an MP, and after only one parliamentary term.

The then Kitui Central MP, alongside the late Prof Wangari Maathai, made history with the – no doubt courageous and daring move – to become the first women in the country to contest the presidency – for years an exclusive boys’ club.

This was in the 1997 General Election that saw Ms Ngilu emerge an impressive fifth, to beat among others, veteran politician Martin Shikuku of Ford Asili, in the contest predictably won by Kanu’s incumbent, the late Daniel Arap Moi.

Prof Maathai came 13th in the crowded race of 15 candidates. Although hers has since been a consistence rise in the political leadership, holding Cabinet positions in the successive administration of Presidents Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta (after 2013 elections) – and now governor, Ms Ngilu is yet to attempt the presidency again.

Likewise, Ms Martha Karua, the long serving MP for Gichugu, a former minister in the Kibaki administration and the Narc-Kenya party leader, made a go at the highest office, in the 2013 General Election. She was the only woman in the ring of eight candidates.

Elected female governor

In the 2017 elections, Ms Karua returned to her Kirinyaga home county, contested the governorship and lost to Ms Anne Waiguru – the other elected female governor – in a closely contested race. Ms Karua disputed the results and unsuccessfully challenged them up to the Supreme Court.

In November last year, however, she won a reprieve at the Arusha-based East African Court of Justice and was awarded Sh2.7 million in damages for violations of her rights to a fair hearing in the petition.

Nairobi’s Anne Kananu Mwenda, was sworn in as the deputy governor last month, to replace impeached Mike Mbuvi Sonko. He had nominated her as his deputy before he was pushed out of office through a no-confidence vote by the Nairobi County Assembly.

This is just but a brief summary of recent history that tells of the struggles as well as experiences and of course resilience, of some of the most outstanding Kenyan women in the country’s male-dominated field – as they seek to fight their way to the nation’s top political echelons and leadership.

Elective political office

Although more women are now moving to top management roles in other sectors, indications are clear that the journey to high – specifically elective political office, is still replete with thorns. This reluctance to level the political field to ensure fair competition of women and men is what makes many Kenyans of goodwill – especially women – be deeply sceptical that there will be gender parity in the country’s politics.

As Kenya’s women battle for political space and top positions in politics, however, it is important for them to celebrate and support those already,  or on their way up, after defying many odds to achieve that feat. That support – moral or otherwise – by fellow women, is critical in encouraging those who intend to join politics to do so, with the knowledge that a sister will be present to not only egg them on, but to also give a shoulder to cry on.

Similarly, most of those already in positions will without a doubt, do with the encouragement, support and even mentorship of fellow women, to keep moving on.

That is why women should keep away from the common conduct of stereotyping leaders of the female gender, especially those in politics. This, however, is not to say that women should not criticise their own when they stray as leaders. Asking that of women is undemocratic and amounts to suppressing their voices.

Gender parity

It is also undemocratic – and this is very common, when leaders – in explaining away the low number of elected women in Parliament and County Assembly, take to a blanket blame of women voters “who are the majority, and cannot elect their own’’! Women, like all other Kenyans, are entitled to vote for candidates of their choice, irrespective of the gender.

Instead, as Kenyans, we must support women leadership by electing those qualified to the position. In the meantime, history has taught us that when women are not elected and appointed to political office, political decisions made do not sufficiently serve the needs and inclinations of the female gender.

That is why women leaders and those who support the course of gender parity must learn to reject and keep voicing out against the notion that women are to be “given” positions. Women and men are equal in the eyes of Kenya’s Constitution.

"On a mission to keep girls in school, protect them from sex pests","While living at a border town often offers lucrative cross-border trade for many people, this is not the case for teenage girls in Busia County.  Snarl-up of long distance trucks is a common feature at the town that borders Uganda.

The situation worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic with truck drivers having to spend longer days at the border town due to pandemic related checks.

Confronted with poverty, teenage girls and women in the region engage in sex in exchange for money; money the young girls need so much to purchase vital things like sanitary pads.

Many have dropped out of school due to early pregnancies, early marriages, lack of guidance by a responsible adult and ill-health resulting from sexually transmitted diseases.

A young Teso woman, Ms Abukayo Murunga is, however, out to change this story. The 26-year-old has been in rural Teso for the last five years, doing everything possible to bring other women into safe paths.

Access to education

“I am familiar with the challenges girls and women here go through. Challenges that limit their access to education and opportunities for growth. For instance, girls miss school during their menstruation days because of their parents’ inability to provide them with menstrual hygiene management products,"" she says.

Ms Murunga adds: ""I have seen families languishing in abject poverty and as a result, send their girls to engage in sex (not as express as it may sound) with truck drivers, as a way of fending for themselves and families. I have visited schools where girls as young as ten years have been impregnated. It breaks my heart. It is here that l find my reason to create change in this community.""

With every rising sun, Ms Murunga is out to scale up her efforts towards addressing these challenges. Her initial activities reached the girls through the Amot Network, a foundation she started eight months ago. Now she reaches them through the Border Hub – a youth and community development organisation in Busia.

She provides information on sexual reproductive health and rights to enable girls (and women) make informed decisions about their sexuality and not fall victims of their own desperation.

""With other like-minded individuals and organisations in the region like (CCGD), we do structured mentorship programmes; tailored towards providing information around goal-setting, life skills such as negotiation skills, assertiveness which go a long way to enable the girls stand up for their rights,"" explains the Bachelor of Information Systems graduate.

Last June, she adopted the T-boxes (Talking Boxes) approach where girls freely drop their concerns in boxes at a local church.

""I adopted the use of T-boxes after realising that many girls were not speaking out yet they were going through a lot in their homes. Since then, the responses have been overwhelming,"" Ms Murunga says.

She plans to partner with guidance and counselling teachers in local schools to introduce T-boxes once studies steadily resume, following Covid-19 interruptions.

Ms Murunga and like-minded individuals at the Border Hub run a Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) programme where they boldly speak to youths about sex, a taboo topic in Teso.

Teso region

""I am keen on providing information that’s focused on growing and nurturing them. I spend most of my time interacting with girls and women; getting to know their challenges and, together, we develop sustainable solutions.""

Ms Murunga observes that ""they have so far reached out to at least 200 girls within Teso region. The girls then act as ambassadors in their communities, hence strengthening our reach.""

Her outreach has seen close to 50 girls who dropped out of school, due to early pregnancies enrol back in class.

Ms Murunga, who is passionate about advocacy, research and policy reforms on SRHR, is the 'Kenya ni Mimi' (a signature programme by the Ministry of Youth and ICT) ambassador for Busia County.

She is an Emerging Leaders Foundation (EFL) Fellow and the pioneer for Young African Leaders Initiative (Yali) Busia - Chapter. She characterises her success in women and girls' issues in Teso to the knowledge and leadership skills she gathers from EFL and YALI.

Resource mobilisation

Her background with EFL and YALI, she says, has put her on the map including sitting on the Busia County Youth Technical Working Group where she has been directly involved in highlighting gaps that hinder youth development.

Thanks to EFL and YALI, Ms Murunga is equipped with resource mobilisation skills that have helped her engage organisations to provide sanitary pads to needy girls, implement the Talking Boxes and hold regular talks with girls in schools and churches.

Ms Murunga recognises that female poverty and reproductive health is a problem everywhere, thus uses social media too, to move the ""powerful information"" far and wide.

""I primarily use social media platforms to amplify girls' and women’s issues,"" she tells The Voice.

The main challenge in Ms Murunga's mission, however, is lack of a stable source of funding and a society that considers the topic on sex a taboo, and a patriarchal mind-set that limits women in terms of land ownership, decision-making and leadership positions.

For the alumnus of Kisii University, women's issues are pressing challenges all over the world thus require urgent attention.

“I want to be at the very forefront influencing the formulation, implementation and strengthening of policies around reintegration of girls who get pregnant prematurely. I want to advocate for the implementation of zero price on sanitary towels so that girls can easily access them and stay in school,"" says Ms Murunga.

In the words of Mahatma Ghandi, Ms Murunga believes that she is shaking the world in a gentle way.

Too poor for menses; period!,"Anyone who menstruates requires proper access to menstrual materials, safe and hygienic facilities and the right to manage it without shame or stigma. Unfortunately, some women and adolescent girls live in period poverty.

Research shows that more than 800 million women menstruate daily and majority can’t manage their menses in a dignified and healthy way.

American Medical Women's Association defines period poverty as inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, including, but not limited to sanitary products, washing facilities and waste management.

Period poverty is an underlying issue that contributes to the persistent high numbers of teenage pregnancies.

Studies have also shown that absence of an environment supportive of the girls’ menstrual hygiene management (MHM) hinders them from attending school.

Of the 250 girls interviewed in a study – Menstrual Hygiene Management and School Absenteeism among Adolescents in Ghana: Results from a School-Based Cross-Sectional Study in a Rural Community by Shamsudeen Mohammed et al., 60.4 per cent said lack of a private place to manage periods at school kept them off.

A majority (82.2 per cent) missed school due to menstrual pain, found the study whose findings were published last year in the International Journal of Reproductive Medicine.

Another 70.3 per cent were deterred by the fear of staining and being teased, while 63.4 per cent stayed away due to non-availability of pads.

Another study Menstrual hygiene management in rural schools of Zambia; a descriptive study of knowledge, experiences and challenges faced by schoolgirls by Joyce Chinyama et al. attests to similar challenges.

Girls in six rural schools in Zambia were interviewed.

They said inadequate provision of sanitary materials, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools forced them to stay at home during menstruation.

Isolating themselves

“Boys said they could tell when girls were menstruating by their smell and behaviour, for instance, moving less and isolating themselves from their peers,” the researchers state in study published in 2019, in BMC Public Health.

“Girls complained of friction burns on their inner thighs during their long journey to school due to chaffing of wet non-absorbent material used to make menstrual cloth,” it further reads.

The findings are a reflection of Kenya’s situation. It refers to a previous study in Kenya that established that “Poor WASH facilities deter girls from using the facilities at school, with most girls opting to stay home until they finish menstruating.”

On average, girls begin puberty at 10 or 11 years depending on factors such as nutrition, guides Unesco in its 2014 document Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management.

In Kenya, Unesco estimates that some 2.6 million girls in school need support to obtain menstrual hygiene products. Further, approximately 300,000 of girls in arid and semi-arid regions would require both sanitary towels and underwear at an estimated cost of Sh2.6 billion.

In 2012/13 financial year, Sh300 million was set aside for the Ministry of Education to provide the sanitary towels. This amount was reduced to Sh30 million in 2013/14 financial year.

Until 2017, the ministry provided an estimated 568,925 underprivileged girls in public primary schools in 82 districts (now sub-counties) within marginalised and slum areas.

The coming into effect of Basic Education (Amendment) Act in June 2017 guaranteed all girls in puberty age enrolled in public primary and secondary schools, free provision of pads. In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was allocated Sh470 million. This catered for 14, 813, 810 packets distributed to 3.7 million girls during the fiscal year.  A sum of Sh420, 618,057 was spent.

Private schools

There are 9.2 million girls enrolled in primary schools and 4.3 million others in secondary schools, confirms data from 2019 Census.

Although data on girls in private schools is elusive, the current data could suggest that 72 per cent of the targeted girls have not benefited from the State sponsored programme.

In May last year, the Ministry of Health launched Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030) with one of the five targets being commitment to ensure WASH facilities are provided in all households, learning institutions, public places, healthcare facilities, workplaces and correctional facilities.

“Without (access to menstrual hygiene materials, latrines and places to change, safe water and sanitation, and good hygiene practices like hand washing with soap), the school environment is unhealthy, gender discriminatory and inadequate,” states Unesco in its aforementioned publication.

Ministry of Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha announced mid-January the purchase of Sh470 million worth sanitary towels for an unspecified number of girls in public schools across the country.

He said the distribution would begin in the third week of January with each of the benefiting girls receiving a one-off bundle lasting them nine months.

“Each girl will get a collection of (pads for) nine months at once,” he said at Kahundira Primary School in Kiambu County.

It’s, however, unlikely that the girls will receive pads covering the nine-months with the financial allocation.

With the Sh470 million, at least 3.7 million girls will get four packets of the pads out of the 4.2 million needy cases. This will last four months.

In 2019, the then Public Service and Gender Affairs Principal Secretary Ms Safina Kwekwe revealed challenges bedevilling the programme.

“When we started distributing the sanitary pads in the 2017/18 financial year, we gave them out to 3.7 million girls. We spent Sh460 million. We only gave four packs to girls in public primary, secondary and special schools. We had nothing for girls in vocational training and other institutions,” Ms Kwekwe is quoted in a local newspaper article dated September 14, 2019.

She added: “We have been having challenges because the money is not adequate. We need to have more so that girls can remain in school throughout but we have only been able to give them four months’ supply in the past.”

With the new law accompanied with the Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030), it meant, the government sat at the centre of meeting the menstrual hygiene management needs of girls in public facilities.

In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was moved to the Ministry of Public and Gender Affairs only for it to be moved back to the Education ministry, late 2019 following hiccups in tendering and distribution.

From Tana River to Busia, menses remain a taboo topic burying girls in shame

In May last year, we shared a story on the challenges women in Tana River County face during their menses.

Fortunately, period poverty is fast becoming a thing of the past after we covered the story on menstrual hygiene challenges where women dug holes to sit on for hours during their menses.

The story that shocked the world, saw donors from as far as Turkey, Britain and the US march into the county to triumph over the shame of the 21st Century, marking the genesis of a revolution that is fast reinstating comfort to lives of the women and girls in the region.

Menstrual hygiene ambassadors and menstrual cops moved into villages donating countless sanitary towels.

“In the past, we could not even talk about our private parts, sanitary pads were not a language we spoke. We only did what our mothers taught us,"" says Salima Waqo, a mother of three.

Ms Waqo is one of the women who taught her children the traditional way of menstrual hygiene since that is what she knew.

According to her, she learnt about sanitary towels in June after activists started making door to door visits to teach on menstrual hygiene.

""Even my children knew about sanitary towels, but they never shared with me, they were embarrassed to do so,"" she says.

Leila Nuru, an activist and a menstrual cop notes that most women from pastoral communities are not schooled on sanitary towels, and rely on traditional methods, where rags are used or holes are dug in the worst circumstances.

The activist notes that even shops in the remote areas never stock sanitary towels.

""Women in our community are very shy, if they have to buy sanitary towels from a shop, the attendant has to be a woman, or they will send a child,"" she says.

Ms Nuru has started training men from pastoralists’ communities on understanding menstrual hygiene and how to support their children and women through the process.

According to her, in the community where men are the providers, only knowledge is required to sustain the solutions currently being implemented.

However, poverty remains the community's biggest challenge. As a result, the women have appealed to the national government and relative organisations to equip them with re-usable sanitary towels.

They say that unlike the disposable ones, re-usable towels are sustainable, cost, and environmental-friendly.

According to Muslima Godana, an activist, a lot of the disposable sanitary towels have ended up in water reservoirs and the streets, hence detrimental to both the environment and human health.

""The disposable towels need to be done away with as we adopt an alternative solution,"" she says.

Efforts to eradicate menstrual disparity in the county are encouraging, with the county government allocating Sh2 million to support menstrual hygiene.

Kenya Works Organisation among other organisations, distributes re-usable sanitary towels targeting 5,000 girls and women in pastoral communities for free.

In Busia County, many adolescent girls faced with challenges of accessing menstrual hygiene management products admit to having transactional sex for pads.

Ms Mary Makokha, the Director of Rural Education and Economic Enhancement Programme (Reep) says some parents only provide food for their families and ask the girls to look for other basic needs on their own.

“This is happening because of poverty – girls and some women don’t have the financial means to buy sanitary products,” says Ms Makokha, noting that men also take advantage of desperate students, sexually exploiting them before offering money for their basic needs.

The girls accept as low as Sh50 to buy sanitary towels.

“Girls are exposed to boda boda riders, truck drivers, shamba boys and even weird grown up men in the villages,” Ms Makokha adds.

The poverty rate pushes some of the girls to either engage in prostitution or marry young to ease the financial burden on their families.

Ms Florence Opetu* (not her real name), a Form Three student at Murende Mixed Secondary School says she engaged in the business when she could not afford pads.

“One day, I was having my periods but did not have pads; when I stood up, my clothes were stained. The whole class started laughing,” she says.

This really embarrassed her.

“One day while heading home from school, a boda boda rider offered me a lift. I resisted hesitantly but after he persuaded me and assured that it was a mere lift, I accepted,” she adds.

The school girl says she ended up getting into a relationship with the man in his mid-30s.

Period poverty is a widespread problem in the country – and those who cannot afford sanitary pads use old cloths, pieces of blankets and newspapers.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, girls who got free sanitary products at school were pushed to desperate measures and scores became pregnant as they looked for money for pads.

The government failed to extend the services to their homes when schools closed on March 15, 2020, leaving the girls at the mercy of the society.

Meanwhile in Kilifi County, stakeholders and organisations have been in the frontline to boost the National government’s initiative, through the Woman Representative’s office, to provide sanitary towels to school girls.

This is an indication that the sanitary pads being distributed by National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) do not meet the demands in schools.

The Filipino winning souls while ensuring they enjoy every moment of life

As you drive towards South Kinangop, off the Naivasha-Nairobi highway, there is an imposing house on the hill overlooking Lake Naivasha.

The house owner is a Filipino woman who came to Kenya in 1998. Ms Minalyn Nicklin, 56, is a missionary with a big vision and mission; to help poor girls and women in Naivasha and its environs enjoy safe menstrual hygiene management (MHM).

Ms Minalyn Nicklin displays some of the reusable sanitary pads she makes at her house in Naivasha town.

She makes reusable sanitary pads that are environmentally friendly, accessible and affordable, in a section of her house, which she has converted into a workshop.

Disposable sanitary pads are prohibitively expensive for girls and women in Naivasha rural villages. This means that during menstruation, they use old clothes which often leak, staining their dresses and are uncomfortable.

Ms Nicklin wants this to change. ""I believe every journey in a positive direction starts with a single step. Making sanitary pads that are easy to use, inexpensive, and recyclable could be a big help for women.""

Her husband, Mr Peter Nicklin who is a medical doctor and her step son Alistair support her venture.

She says limited access to clean water, proper sanitation facilities and sanitary pads make it difficult for girls and women to manage their menstruation hygienically.

As a result, many young women face considerable physical and social challenges during menstruation, including missing school and missing out on important economic activities.

Ms Nicklin’s venture has support from local partners and individual volunteers from the US.

Her pads are made of cotton with the inside layer made from a nylon-type fabric. They are washable after use enabling users to save money because of a longer utility.

Women and girls who use them say they are comfortable and leak-free.

""I have no fears moving and doing my house chores,"" says Ms Jemimah Musimbi, a beneficiary.

Ms Nicklin says the objective of her missionary work in the country is not just to win souls alone but also make sure the souls enjoy every moment of their lives.

“I have discovered that many poor women and girls in the surrounding villages use old rags, and other unhygienic substances like leaves as pad during menstruation,"" says the mother of two.

This, she says, could lead to reproductive diseases and affect maternal mortality.

""My mission is not just to increase the accessibility and use of clean sanitary pads, but also create job opportunities for rural women,"" she explains.

She has invested in five sewing machines and employed three workers.

‘Period man’ seeking to change men’s mindsets towards menses

He calls himself Period Man! A year ago, 28-year-old Mr James Atito was teaching girls at Kakuma village in Turkana County how to use pads, maintain cleanliness during the menses and manage pain among other things.

He had been contracted to undertake the sensitisation. Then one of the girls stood up and asked him: ""Why do you talk about periods? Are you period man?"" That passed as one of those curious queries. The session ended. Evening came.

As he took a walk around the village in the evening, he noticed a group of seven girls sitting along the paths on the rills. Some sat on the bare soil. Some on animal skins.

""I wondered why the girls were sitting there late in the evening when they should be at home,"" he starts off the conversation.

Mr James Atito is a male advocate in the fight towards ending period poverty.

""I was shocked to be told that they were on periods and that they were forbidden from their homesteads until their periods were over. That was an unimaginable stigma. I felt so sad for them and it got me thinking. I said I must do something to end the stigma.""

His journey back to Mombasa, where he is based, was filled with thought of what he can do different to emancipate women and girls from period shame and discrimination.

After two months of researching through reading publications on periods and web scraping, Mr Atito found a missing voice in ending period poverty – that of men.

""Often men are barriers to women's access and use of family planning. And we tell men to be engaged in family planning but we don't tell them how. It's the case with how girls access and use sanitary towels,"" he says.

To reach men and use himself as an example of a male advocate in the fight towards ending period poverty, he settled for Period Man, an identity that equally identifies with the girl who sought to find out whether he has the monthly experiences of menses.

So who is the Period Man? This is the brand name behind Mr Atito that he copyrighted through formal registration with Kenya Copyright Board.

For the past one year, Mr Atito has run two campaigns on Facebook and Twitter,

#Men4Periods365 and #Men4PeriodsMovement, meant to raise men's consciousness on their role in ending period poverty.

He for instance shares information on period pain and its management, how to make reusable pads - a skill he learnt through apprentice - and maintain menstrual hygiene.

""Men perpetrate period shame and discrimination. My mission is to reach them at the household level and find sustainable solutions. Once we have solutions, we will no longer need to push the government or partners to provide girls with the pads,"" he reckons.

Mr Atito studied finance and accounting.

Period of shame that birthed Janet’s book My First Time

“It was a shocking, frustrating and sad. How is it that we are in 2013 and the girls are using chicken feathers and goats hides?” This is Ms Janet Mbugua’s reflection of a feature on period poverty titled “Period of Shame.”

Ms Janet Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, launched in 2014, to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls.

It was aired on a local TV station in 2013. It featured girls from Marigat in Baringo County who demonstrated how they fitted the non-absorbent goat hides or stuffed chicken feathers in their underwear. They pluck the feathers from a live or slaughtered chicken. While unmarried girls are allowed to borrow the goat hides from their married peers, a harmful practice that exposes them to infections.

One of the girls interviewed said: “It is very uncomfortable. It pricks you. During examination, I write while standing,” added the girl then in Class Seven.

At the time, 90 per cent of the allocation to the sanitary towels programme had been slashed.

Ms Mbugua is the founder of Inua Dada Foundation, born out of the pain and shock she felt when she watched the feature. Since its launch in 2014, Ms Mbugua has used it as the voice to call the government to action to prioritise the menstrual hygiene needs of girls.

‘Period of Shame’ was the topic of discussion in her subsequent talk shows. For days, the discussion trended on Twitter.

“People were outraged to the point they were leaving pads for those girls outside our gates of the TV station,” she shares. “And it triggered me, so I asked my boss ‘Can we do something? I don’t feel okay with this just dying as it is. She agreed and I came up with Inua Dada Initiative.”

The initiative, she says, was aimed at pushing the government to allocate the programme more money alongside mobilising resources to buy pads for the girls.

Later, they delivered pads and underwear to about 10,000 girls in Baringo County. Nevertheless, she was not happy about the one-off donation.

The need for a sustainable means to end girls’ inaccessibility to the menstrual products, proper sanitation facilities and information, nagged her. And this is how she ended up registering her foundation in 2014. And later in 2017, opting out of the media.

In 2018, she started compiling content for her book My First Time. The book that launched in February last year, profiles menstruation experiences of 50 girls including those with disability and HIV.

With the book, she purposes, breaking the silence on period poverty and ending the stigma, attached to it. She also features men’s voices.

“Men cannot be ignored in the conversation. They are our biggest allies,” she says.

Her book is bringing changes to how men perceive the subject.

“I’d go to places and fathers could come up to me and say ‘Your book helped me figure out, how to break down this conversation at home with my sons and daughters,” she says.

Ms Mbugua is extending the book to add an addendum on the Pan-African perspective on emerging period poverty issues during the Covid-19 period. The new version will be out in two months.

She says: “Period poverty was blown wide open during Covid-19. Suddenly, schools that were giving pads were closed. Suddenly, the women who were washing clothes to earn a keep had lost their jobs. A lot of girls turned to sex for pads, more than we know.”

She is happy her relentless efforts on social media have resulted in more people engaging in the subject, wrapped as a taboo.

“I posted a picture of my stained pyjamas…there were 10,000 likes and about 1,000 comments. It tells you people want to talk,” she says.

“A few people in the comment section are saying ‘Thank you for just opening this door for us to comment on an issue that is so often a taboo.’…and for me that is a win.”

In the midst of the pandemic, Ms Mbugua has maintained the momentum through virtual activities.

Last year, she held a virtual period party where women highlighted the prevailing challenges and advocated for action from the government. She has earned herself a special friend for her consistent campaign against period poverty; public criticism.

Late last year, her foundation embarked on a sustainable approach of ending period poverty. It entered into partnership with The Pad Project to run a two-pronged pad project in Nairobi County.

Too poor for menses; period!,"Anyone who menstruates requires proper access to menstrual materials, safe and hygienic facilities and the right to manage it without shame or stigma. Unfortunately, some women and adolescent girls live in period poverty.

Research shows that more than 800 million women menstruate daily and majority can’t manage their menses in a dignified and healthy way.

American Medical Women's Association defines period poverty as inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, including, but not limited to sanitary products, washing facilities and waste management.

Period poverty is an underlying issue that contributes to the persistent high numbers of teenage pregnancies.

Studies have also shown that absence of an environment supportive of the girls’ menstrual hygiene management (MHM) hinders them from attending school.

Of the 250 girls interviewed in a study – Menstrual Hygiene Management and School Absenteeism among Adolescents in Ghana: Results from a School-Based Cross-Sectional Study in a Rural Community by Shamsudeen Mohammed et al., 60.4 per cent said lack of a private place to manage periods at school kept them off.

A majority (82.2 per cent) missed school due to menstrual pain, found the study whose findings were published last year in the International Journal of Reproductive Medicine.

Another 70.3 per cent were deterred by the fear of staining and being teased, while 63.4 per cent stayed away due to non-availability of pads.

Another study Menstrual hygiene management in rural schools of Zambia; a descriptive study of knowledge, experiences and challenges faced by schoolgirls by Joyce Chinyama et al. attests to similar challenges.

Girls in six rural schools in Zambia were interviewed.

They said inadequate provision of sanitary materials, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools forced them to stay at home during menstruation.

Isolating themselves

“Boys said they could tell when girls were menstruating by their smell and behaviour, for instance, moving less and isolating themselves from their peers,” the researchers state in study published in 2019, in BMC Public Health.

“Girls complained of friction burns on their inner thighs during their long journey to school due to chaffing of wet non-absorbent material used to make menstrual cloth,” it further reads.

The findings are a reflection of Kenya’s situation. It refers to a previous study in Kenya that established that “Poor WASH facilities deter girls from using the facilities at school, with most girls opting to stay home until they finish menstruating.”

On average, girls begin puberty at 10 or 11 years depending on factors such as nutrition, guides Unesco in its 2014 document Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management.

In Kenya, Unesco estimates that some 2.6 million girls in school need support to obtain menstrual hygiene products. Further, approximately 300,000 of girls in arid and semi-arid regions would require both sanitary towels and underwear at an estimated cost of Sh2.6 billion.

In 2012/13 financial year, Sh300 million was set aside for the Ministry of Education to provide the sanitary towels. This amount was reduced to Sh30 million in 2013/14 financial year.

Until 2017, the ministry provided an estimated 568,925 underprivileged girls in public primary schools in 82 districts (now sub-counties) within marginalised and slum areas.

The coming into effect of Basic Education (Amendment) Act in June 2017 guaranteed all girls in puberty age enrolled in public primary and secondary schools, free provision of pads. In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was allocated Sh470 million. This catered for 14, 813, 810 packets distributed to 3.7 million girls during the fiscal year.  A sum of Sh420, 618,057 was spent.

Private schools

There are 9.2 million girls enrolled in primary schools and 4.3 million others in secondary schools, confirms data from 2019 Census.

Although data on girls in private schools is elusive, the current data could suggest that 72 per cent of the targeted girls have not benefited from the State sponsored programme.

In May last year, the Ministry of Health launched Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030) with one of the five targets being commitment to ensure WASH facilities are provided in all households, learning institutions, public places, healthcare facilities, workplaces and correctional facilities.

“Without (access to menstrual hygiene materials, latrines and places to change, safe water and sanitation, and good hygiene practices like hand washing with soap), the school environment is unhealthy, gender discriminatory and inadequate,” states Unesco in its aforementioned publication.

Ministry of Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha announced mid-January the purchase of Sh470 million worth sanitary towels for an unspecified number of girls in public schools across the country.

He said the distribution would begin in the third week of January with each of the benefiting girls receiving a one-off bundle lasting them nine months.

“Each girl will get a collection of (pads for) nine months at once,” he said at Kahundira Primary School in Kiambu County.

It’s, however, unlikely that the girls will receive pads covering the nine-months with the financial allocation.

With the Sh470 million, at least 3.7 million girls will get four packets of the pads out of the 4.2 million needy cases. This will last four months.

In 2019, the then Public Service and Gender Affairs Principal Secretary Ms Safina Kwekwe revealed challenges bedevilling the programme.

“When we started distributing the sanitary pads in the 2017/18 financial year, we gave them out to 3.7 million girls. We spent Sh460 million. We only gave four packs to girls in public primary, secondary and special schools. We had nothing for girls in vocational training and other institutions,” Ms Kwekwe is quoted in a local newspaper article dated September 14, 2019.

She added: “We have been having challenges because the money is not adequate. We need to have more so that girls can remain in school throughout but we have only been able to give them four months’ supply in the past.”

With the new law accompanied with the Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030), it meant, the government sat at the centre of meeting the menstrual hygiene management needs of girls in public facilities.

In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was moved to the Ministry of Public and Gender Affairs only for it to be moved back to the Education ministry, late 2019 following hiccups in tendering and distribution.

“People were outraged to the point they were leaving pads for those girls outside our gates of the TV station,” she shares. “And it triggered me, so I asked my boss ‘Can we do something? I don’t feel okay with this just dying as it is. She agreed and I came up with Inua Dada Initiative.”

The initiative, she says, was aimed at pushing the government to allocate the programme more money alongside mobilising resources to buy pads for the girls.

Later, they delivered pads and underwear to about 10,000 girls in Baringo County. Nevertheless, she was not happy about the one-off donation.

The need for a sustainable means to end girls’ inaccessibility to the menstrual products, proper sanitation facilities and information, nagged her. And this is how she ended up registering her foundation in 2014. And later in 2017, opting out of the media.

In 2018, she started compiling content for her book My First Time. The book that launched in February last year, profiles menstruation experiences of 50 girls including those with disability and HIV.

With the book, she purposes, breaking the silence on period poverty and ending the stigma, attached to it. She also features men’s voices.

“Men cannot be ignored in the conversation. They are our biggest allies,” she says.

Her book is bringing changes to how men perceive the subject.

“I’d go to places and fathers could come up to me and say ‘Your book helped me figure out, how to break down this conversation at home with my sons and daughters,” she says.

Ms Mbugua is extending the book to add an addendum on the Pan-African perspective on emerging period poverty issues during the Covid-19 period. The new version will be out in two months.

She says: “Period poverty was blown wide open during Covid-19. Suddenly, schools that were giving pads were closed. Suddenly, the women who were washing clothes to earn a keep had lost their jobs. A lot of girls turned to sex for pads, more than we know.”

She is happy her relentless efforts on social media have resulted in more people engaging in the subject, wrapped as a taboo.

“I posted a picture of my stained pyjamas…there were 10,000 likes and about 1,000 comments. It tells you people want to talk,” she says.

“A few people in the comment section are saying ‘Thank you for just opening this door for us to comment on an issue that is so often a taboo.’…and for me that is a win.”

In the midst of the pandemic, Ms Mbugua has maintained the momentum through virtual activities.

Last year, she held a virtual period party where women highlighted the prevailing challenges and advocated for action from the government. She has earned herself a special friend for her consistent campaign against period poverty; public criticism.

Late last year, her foundation embarked on a sustainable approach of ending period poverty. It entered into partnership with The Pad Project to run a two-pronged pad project in Nairobi County.

The all-female crew bringing prestige to the matatu industry,"Travelling by public means can be a nightmare to many passengers. In an industry perceived to be marred with chaos and uncivilised characters, one would only hope to safely arrive at their destination.

However, when you get to a bus station and are welcomed by smartly dressed ladies who diligently assist you with the ticket booking and even pray for you before you embark on the journey, you certainly want to be sure you are not at an airport.

This is the exact situation you meet at one of Nakuru town’s matatu termini – it is changing the status quo of the matatu industry.

Prestige Sacco, which has been in operation for years, has stormed the industry with its unique style of operation, a total shift from the norm.

With women as its main crew, the distasteful attributes of the sometimes rowdy, foul-mouthed and uncivilised touts is nothing in sight.

The ladies, dressed in red skirt suits complete with hats resembling those of flight attendants, are in full control of transport services, something that has seen the transport company feted for being the best in the country.

The female crew does all the touting, customer care and ferrying of passengers to different destinations across the country.

Ms Grace Njoki, who holds a diploma in information communication and technology is in charge of customer relations. Now in her fourth year working with the company, the 26-year-old’s job is to ensure customers leave the station satisfied, comfortable and motivated.

Once a passenger arrives at the booking office, Ms Njoki welcomes them with a gentle smile, warming their hearts before directing them to the booking office.

“I help potential customers with booking of tickets, direct them to their seats, tuck their luggage safely in the back compartment and ensure they belt up,” she says.

She then ensures each customer has received their cash balances, in case of any, before introducing the trip driver.  What follows is the invitation of a pastor to pray for the journey before the vehicle takes off.

When she was first offered the job, Ms Njoki says she was reluctant as she did not want to be associated with a job that has a negative perception from the minds of the public.

But upon learning their way of operation, she gladly accepted and has since been part of the crew.

“I realised that the customers appreciated our services so much and I started loving the job. I do not regret taking the offer,” says Ms Njoki.

The company named her the hostess of the year 2020. One of her main challenges is dealing with different types of customers, which she says can be overwhelming.

Ms Carol Nduko, on the other hand, is in charge of sales, marketing and customer relations department. A holder of higher diploma in sales and marketing, she says her job involves looking into the welfare of customers.

As a team leader, Ms Nduko handles complaints or compliments arising from the passengers using their vehicles.

“My work is to create a long-lasting relationship between the customer and the company by ensuring they get quality service. I even keep their contacts to follow up on them to know their journey experience,” she says.

Ms Ann Grace Wanjiku is a driver who criss-crosses the country ferrying passengers to different regions. The 27-year-old is a certified driver with more than five years’ experience.

In her fourth year working with the shuttle company, Ms Wanjiku says the experience has been thrilling, especially considering that she is among the few female drivers.

Negative attitude

She notes that doing a job that is dominated by men has not been all rosy as she has had to deal with negative attitude from some men who despise her.

""What keeps me going is my love for the job and the appreciation I get from the passengers at the end of the journey. Most of them congratulate me, including those who had issues at the start of the journey,” she says.

After operating for a decade, the company recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. For the second consecutive year, they were awarded for being the best fleet shuttle of the year.

They received a trophy last month in a colourful ceremony hosted by the road safety agency, Safety Plus Consulting Limited formerly the National Road Safety Agency.

Speaking during the celebration, Mr Alphayo Otuke, the Chief Executive Officer of Safety Plus Limited said the Prestige Shuttle has proved to be an important stakeholder in the government’s efforts to promote safety on the highways.

He said the agency considered many parameters ranging from the manner of operations, company innovations systems such as the Information Communication Technology that enable efficiency and accident ratings among other things, before settling on the winner.

“We need to see all stakeholders play their part in promoting road safety in order to reduce the worrying surge in number accidents along our roads,” said Mr Otuke.

While receiving the award, the company director Mr Steve Muli, who is also the chairman of the Central Rift Matatu Owners Association, said his aim is to change the traditional perception of the industry by offering decent services.

“We promise to maintain our quality standards to be emulated by other stakeholders in the industry. As we begin our second decade, our aim will be to see the matatu industry respected as any other serious business,” said Mr Muli.

The company has invested heavily on customer relations with their focus on the female employees.

Ms Chebet, a regular customer with the service says she has used the shuttles for four years now.

“I live in Baringo County but work in Nairobi, so I travel every weekend sometimes with my family, and I have been using the shuttles. I love the services because I do not need to worry about careless driving,” she says.

Mr Muli says he initially employed men before changing the strategy after four years of poor business. The director says the decision to have women in the crew turned out to be his golden opportunity as business blossomed very fast.

“We were shocked when the high number of customers overwhelmed our staff. We were forced to recruit more women after realising that the customers loved their services,” he says.

"Ending SGBV requires open talks about stereotypes, norms","Sexual violence is not a women’s problem, nor a girl’s problem. It is an entire society’s problem because it affects us all. Breaking down harmful stereotypes and bringing men and boys into the conversation are two of the most important norm changes we collectively need to nurture.

Sexual violence and harassment take place in our homes, public spaces, workplaces, on the streets and in our education institutions. Exposure is heightened in conflict and emergency contexts.

During Covid-19, violence in the home has become what the global community call, the ‘shadow pandemic’. Reports from Kenya’s national helpline that responds to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) has seen a huge spike in calls since the pandemic began.

Early and forced marriage

Women and girls in Kenya often experience alternate but equally damaging forms of SGBV, both mentally and physically, including child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation and femicide. One in three women globally are affected by gender-based violence, and in Kenya, statistics record 45 per cent of women and girls aged 15-49 have experienced SGBV. One in five women have suffered from female genital mutilation (FGM) in Kenya and 23 per cent of the nation’s girls are married before their 18th birthday, while four per cent are married before their 15th birthday.

The exact numbers of rape and sexual assaults are difficult to assert due to reluctance or fear for victims to report it, and inefficiency in addressing the reports adequately because of lack of capacity and resources and sometimes will.

We are daily witnesses to ‘rape culture’, sometimes even silent bystanders. Society has entrenched the use of misogynistic language, the objectification of women’s bodies on screens, indifference to consent, and the glamorisation of violence in advertisements.

Victim-blaming

Victim-blaming, trivialising of rape and the stigma faced by survivors are still far too common. The understanding of mutual consent; that only yes means yes, given freely without manipulation or coercion – is paramount in the prevention and eradication of rape and sexual harassment.

Male involvement in ending SGBV is particularly crucial as many Kenyan communities remain highly patriarchal. As authority figures, men hold more power and influence over decision-making in the social domain and are often considered the custodians of culture. They are in a position to determine the cultural traits, behaviours and social practices that are viewed as either good or harmful.

The socialisation of boys at an early age can have a long-term impact in shifting gender norms. Some harmful traditional notions of masculinity have been identified as the key drivers of aggression among the male gender.

These include expectations of what it is “to be a man,” where boys are expected to be physically strong, aggressive, showing little emotion in order to maintain the tough persona. What boys learn about expectations of femininity and the value of women and girls at home and in the community also shapes their attitudes towards SGBV.

Healthy masculinity

Efforts should aim at engaging men on the dangers of toxic masculinity and internalised gender bias that can be harmful to the well-being of women and girls. By teaching boys about healthy masculinity, as well as the links between gender inequality and violence against women, we can begin to promote positive behaviours and attitudes towards women’s rights, while eliminating harmful gender stereotypes.

The government has clear legislation and policies on preventing and responding to SGBV. The State Department for Gender is coordinating efforts from a multi-sectoral approach to advocate for this cause. President Uhuru Kenyatta has made firm commitments towards the eradication of GBV and harmful practices by 2030 and to eradicate the practice of FGM by 2022. This strong commitment and leadership is a source of inspiration for all actors, including cultural and religious leaders and calls for concerted efforts to stop the violation of human rights.

16 Days of Activism to End Gender-Based Violence is an international campaign calling for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls. During the 16 days, from November 25 until December 10, we call on people from all walks of life to question those harmful stereotypes and norms that perpetuate violence. No further generations must struggle to cope with a legacy of violation.

If you or someone you know has experience some form violence – call the toll-free line 1195 or Childline 116 to report your case and seek support. You are not alone.

,"In late March, reports of violence against women began flooding into newspapers and onto TV screens as the pandemic picked up speed around the globe.

With over half of the world’s population living under lockdown, millions of women were trapped with an abusive partner, cut off from extended family and often with reduced access to support services due to Covid-19 restrictions.

For many women, the pandemic equalled a two-fold threat; coronavirus infections and being locked in a confined space while facing danger on a daily basis.

In the past nine months, all types of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic, have intensified, according to the UN.

Now, despite most countries around the world tackling the coronavirus head-on, many of those same nations have failed victims of abuse through inadequate planning, funding and attention.

“Men’s violence against women is also a pandemic, one that pre-dates the virus and will outlive it,” said UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in a statement to mark the annual International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women last month.

“It too, needs our global, coordinated response and enforceable protocols. It too affects vast populations of all ages.”

Worsening the situation is many governments’ failure to include protection for those abused as part of their Covid-19 response plans.

According to data from the UN’s Covid-19 Gender Response Tracker, most nations are not doing enough to address the “economic and social fallout” caused by the crisis.

Less than a quarter of the 206 countries analysed by the tracker treated violence against women and girls-related services as an “integral part of their national and local Covid-19 response plans,” with very few providing adequate funding for related services.

The global response has particularly failed women and girls in refugee settings and, displaced and post-conflict environments, according to a new report from the International Rescue Committee. Local women’s groups were critical to maintaining essential gender-based violence (GBV) support services during the pandemic, it adds.



Set against this harrowing backdrop are ongoing economic pressures and widespread job losses, which have contributed to what the UN are calling a ‘shadow pandemic’.

In April, the agency estimated that for every three months of lockdown that continued, an additional 15 million women were expected to be affected by intimate partner violence.

Last year, some 243 million women and girls experienced sexual or physical violence from their partner around the world. In 2020, reports of domestic violence, cyberbullying, child marriages, sexual harassment and sexual violence have increased globally, added Mlambo-Ngcuka.

The abuse is as global as the pandemic; from Brazil to China, Uganda to Nigeria, its alarming rise has been well-documented.

In the UK, the British government failed to prioritise domestic abuse in its lockdown arrangements and did not provide help for abuse victims fast enough by July. At least 16 domestic abuse killings took place between March 23 and April 12 in the UK, much higher than the average for the time of year, according to the Counting Dead Women project.

Around the world, distress calls to abuse hotlines sky-rocketed, though official data isn’t always clear-cut.

A women's hotline in Uganda reported a more than fivefold jump in the number of average weekly domestic violence cases reported once lockdown started in late March.

The British charity Refuge, meanwhile, reported a 700 per cent increase in calls on one single day in April. But in other places, such as Italy, official numbers decreased.

“Sometimes, reported abuse cases are falling dramatically and you would think that violence is going down, but it’s just the opposite,” Christina Wegs, the global advocacy director for sexual and reproductive health and rights for CARE, told the Washington Post in September.

“The drop is reflecting that women and vulnerable people are not able to report what’s happening.”

In fact, evidence shows that the pandemic has resulted in significant increases in GBV in nearly all countries, according to UNAids, especially for women trapped at home with their abusers.

Data compiled by UN Women in April this year across ten countries, including the United States, Singapore and Argentina, showed a heightened demand for access to women’s refuges and other support services, while shelters reached peak capacity in many places, made worse by the fact that some were repurposed for additional Covid-response programmes.

In the early stages of the pandemic, some countries took steps to respond to the warnings of soaring domestic abuse rates.

Canada allocated $50 million to women’s shelters and sexual assault centres, while the government in New Zealand included preparations in its lockdown plans from the beginning (and have since pledged $141 million to domestic and sexual violence services).

France, Italy and Spain each set up programmes to house people in hotels if existing emergency shelters were at capacity.



In Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are also plans to support organizations running shelters, while in Colombia and Sweden financial resources are being allocated to support GBV survivors.

There has also been action on the grassroots level. Women have been at the forefront of protests over the past couple of months in a bid to draw attention to domestic violence and demand government action.

In July, large-scale protests erupted in Turkey over the killing of 27-year-old Pinar Gultekin, a university student whose former partner was later arrested for her murder.

Gultekin is just one of 278 women killed in Turkey because of her gender since the beginning of the year, compared to at least 474 in 2019, the highest rate in a decade, according to the campaign group We Will Stop Femicide Platform. The final figures for 2020 are expected to be higher, given coronavirus lockdowns.

Meanwhile, feminist group Femen staged a topless protest outside President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in Ukraine last month.

And in Mexico, protests to fight physical and sexual violence have taken over the city, with feminists kicking government workers out of the Human Rights Commission building last month to use it as a makeshift shelter for women fleeing violent homes.

But many fear this could be too little, too late.

“The economics of violence are simple and devastating,” says Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka. “No one gains. Everyone loses, and we have to turn this around. We know what it takes to fight a pandemic. Now we need the will to do it.”

For many women, the pandemic equalled a two-fold threat; coronavirus infections and being locked in a confined space while facing danger on a daily basis.

In the past nine months, all types of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic, have intensified, according to the UN.

Now, despite most countries around the world tackling the coronavirus head-on, many of those same nations have failed victims of abuse through inadequate planning, funding and attention.

“Men’s violence against women is also a pandemic, one that pre-dates the virus and will outlive it,” said UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in a statement to mark the annual International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women last month.

“It too, needs our global, coordinated response and enforceable protocols. It too affects vast populations of all ages.”

Worsening the situation is many governments’ failure to include protection for those abused as part of their Covid-19 response plans.

According to data from the UN’s Covid-19 Gender Response Tracker, most nations are not doing enough to address the “economic and social fallout” caused by the crisis.

Less than a quarter of the 206 countries analysed by the tracker treated violence against women and girls-related services as an “integral part of their national and local Covid-19 response plans,” with very few providing adequate funding for related services.

The global response has particularly failed women and girls in refugee settings and, displaced and post-conflict environments, according to a new report from the International Rescue Committee. Local women’s groups were critical to maintaining essential gender-based violence (GBV) support services during the pandemic, it adds.



Set against this harrowing backdrop are ongoing economic pressures and widespread job losses, which have contributed to what the UN are calling a ‘shadow pandemic’.

In April, the agency estimated that for every three months of lockdown that continued, an additional 15 million women were expected to be affected by intimate partner violence.

Last year, some 243 million women and girls experienced sexual or physical violence from their partner around the world. In 2020, reports of domestic violence, cyberbullying, child marriages, sexual harassment and sexual violence have increased globally, added Mlambo-Ngcuka.

The abuse is as global as the pandemic; from Brazil to China, Uganda to Nigeria, its alarming rise has been well-documented.

In the UK, the British government failed to prioritise domestic abuse in its lockdown arrangements and did not provide help for abuse victims fast enough by July. At least 16 domestic abuse killings took place between March 23 and April 12 in the UK, much higher than the average for the time of year, according to the Counting Dead Women project.

Around the world, distress calls to abuse hotlines sky-rocketed, though official data isn’t always clear-cut.

A women's hotline in Uganda reported a more than fivefold jump in the number of average weekly domestic violence cases reported once lockdown started in late March.

The British charity Refuge, meanwhile, reported a 700 per cent increase in calls on one single day in April. But in other places, such as Italy, official numbers decreased.

“Sometimes, reported abuse cases are falling dramatically and you would think that violence is going down, but it’s just the opposite,” Christina Wegs, the global advocacy director for sexual and reproductive health and rights for CARE, told the Washington Post in September.

“The drop is reflecting that women and vulnerable people are not able to report what’s happening.”

In fact, evidence shows that the pandemic has resulted in significant increases in GBV in nearly all countries, according to UNAids, especially for women trapped at home with their abusers.

Data compiled by UN Women in April this year across ten countries, including the United States, Singapore and Argentina, showed a heightened demand for access to women’s refuges and other support services, while shelters reached peak capacity in many places, made worse by the fact that some were repurposed for additional Covid-response programmes.

In the early stages of the pandemic, some countries took steps to respond to the warnings of soaring domestic abuse rates.

Canada allocated $50 million to women’s shelters and sexual assault centres, while the government in New Zealand included preparations in its lockdown plans from the beginning (and have since pledged $141 million to domestic and sexual violence services).

France, Italy and Spain each set up programmes to house people in hotels if existing emergency shelters were at capacity.



In Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are also plans to support organizations running shelters, while in Colombia and Sweden financial resources are being allocated to support GBV survivors.

There has also been action on the grassroots level. Women have been at the forefront of protests over the past couple of months in a bid to draw attention to domestic violence and demand government action.

In July, large-scale protests erupted in Turkey over the killing of 27-year-old Pinar Gultekin, a university student whose former partner was later arrested for her murder.

Gultekin is just one of 278 women killed in Turkey because of her gender since the beginning of the year, compared to at least 474 in 2019, the highest rate in a decade, according to the campaign group We Will Stop Femicide Platform. The final figures for 2020 are expected to be higher, given coronavirus lockdowns.

Meanwhile, feminist group Femen staged a topless protest outside President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in Ukraine last month.

And in Mexico, protests to fight physical and sexual violence have taken over the city, with feminists kicking government workers out of the Human Rights Commission building last month to use it as a makeshift shelter for women fleeing violent homes.

But many fear this could be too little, too late.

“The economics of violence are simple and devastating,” says Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka. “No one gains. Everyone loses, and we have to turn this around. We know what it takes to fight a pandemic. Now we need the will to do it.”

Remember elderly women in campaign to end GBV,"Maria is an 84-year-old widow from Riruta Satellite, a low-income suburb in Nairobi. She is a mother of five children, two sons and three daughters. Her husband died three years ago, leaving her with the family property that included unoccupied land and some rentals.

Shortly afterwards, she shared the property among her children as part of their inheritance and retained a portion as a source of income. Her youngest son was, however, unhappy with the division of property and maintains that his sisters have no rights to the property.

He became hostile and violent towards his mother, intending to directly collect the rent from the rentals. He has now threatened to kill his mother and sisters to take over ownership of the property.

Violence and ageism

Unfortunately, Maria’s story is just one of many. Violence against older women is widespread, with perpetrators ranging from intimate partners, family members, caregivers, and community members.

As we draw to the end of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, an annual international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls, we must reflect on and galvanize action around the need to better protect older women like Maria from all forms of violence and ageism (the targeting of older persons on the basis of their age).

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization estimated that one in six older people- those above the age of 60 - globally, were subjected to abuse in 2019. This was spurred by factors including alcoholism and property ownership disputes, among other issues.

Emerging evidence indicates that the abuse has sharply increased in many countries as a direct result of the pandemic.

Covid-19

Consider the containment measures instituted by governments to flatten the Covid-19 curve; the need for social distancing that culminated in the partial cessation of movement and in some instances, full lockdowns, have left, and continue to leave older persons alone, separated from caring kin who would otherwise often check in on them and ensure their wellbeing.

This exposes them to rogue community members, relatives and caregivers who use the opportunity to exercise their control and abuse, particularly against older women.

A report by the Social Science Research Council indicates that Kenya is among the countries reporting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent average increase in sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) amid lockdowns. This harrowing statistic encompasses SGBV against older persons. What is worse is that victims rarely report the abuse for fear of victimisation. A vicious cycle is, therefore, established, fuelled by ageism and sustained by the inaction of the government and communities.

HelpAge International Africa continues to work with communities to support them to recognize and prevent SGBV against older women and help them access safety and response services. This includes access to counselling and legal advice for survivors. We also provide older people with the information they need to seek support in case of abuse.

Violence and abuse

Additionally, we continue to advocate for laws and policies to protect older women from violence, abuse, and neglect. One such law is the Protocol to the African Charter On Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa. This law provides for, among others, the right to property inheritance by older women; their protection from all forms of violence and abuse, including those emanating from harmful traditional practices; and the provision of care and support. Four years since the adoption of the Protocol, Kenya is yet to ratify it, leaving the rights of older persons in the balance.

Ending SGBV against older women will take a concerted effort. The government should ratify and implement the African Union Protocol on the Rights of Older Persons. Additionally, it must fully implement existing legislation that protects the rights of older women, including increasing budgetary allocation towards the protection and promotion of their rights.

Communities must also treat older women with care and respect. Ageing is not an event but a process that starts at birth. It is, therefore, imperative that we collaborate in putting an end to the mistreatment of older persons including SGBV against them.

Tharaka Nithi County devising law to help end FGM,"Tharaka Nithi County is coming up with a policy that will give it legal power to fight Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).The county is among the 22 FGM hot spots in the country.

Speaking to the media in Chuka earlier in the week, the County Gender Executive Ms Sheila Kiganka who is spearheading the exercise, said the target is to help slay the FGM dragon by 2022 in line with the President Uhuru Kenyatta’s declaration.

She said the policy, soon to be taken to the county assembly to be made law, will give the devolved government latitude to finance initiatives to fight the illegal ‘cut’ that is rampant in Igambang’ombe, Tharaka South and Tharaka North sub-counties.

“We have already formulated the policy with the help of other stakeholders like Plan International Kenya and Ripples International,” said Ms Kiganka.

She said without a law, it’s difficult for the devolved government to fight FGM because it lacks the legal framework and mandate.

Outdated culture

She added that the policy brings together various collaborators in the fight against the outdated culture including non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations, Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders and the government to form synergies.

With the law, the county government with the support of the police and the national government will be able to prosecute FGM perpetrators.

Tharaka Nithi Women Representative Ms Beatrice Nkatha said it’s unfortunate some people continue to practice the outdated culture despite efforts by government and non-government organisations to end it.

She noted that the practice is common during holidays, especially in December and urged government officers to remain vigilant in order to arrest and prosecute any perpetrator.

“It’s embarrassing that there are people still clinging onto the outdated FGM practice that has a lot of disadvantages to our girls,” said Ms Nkatha.

According to Tharaka Nithi County Commissioner Ms Beverly Opwora, cases of FGM and other forms of GBV are on the rise in the region during the Covid-19 pandemic period.

Speaking to journalists separately at her office in Chuka town, Ms Opwora said the culprits are not sparing even girls as young as 10 years.

,"When Dr Karambu Ringera fell out with the father of her son, she went through a traumatic experience that inspired her current work with orphans and survivors of violence.

Dr Karambu, a communication expert, is the founder of International Peace Initiatives (IPI) that runs Kithoka Amani Children’s Home and Tiriji Foundation that have become a haven for HIV/Aids orphans and victims of domestic and sexual violence.

“I was not ready to be married to him and we agreed to share care time for our son. But when he took the boy for the first time, they hid him from me and refused to tell me where he was. I found my son after two years of searching. I managed to see him through a court order but they hid him again for 17 years. I got him back after the father passed on. I think this experience inspired me into the work I do,” Dr Karambu recounts.

Today, Dr Karambu takes care of more than 100 orphans and vulnerable children having started out in 2002 with those orphaned and abandoned due to HIV/Aids.

She says women and children are the most hit when there is violence, poverty and disease which advised the formation of International Peace Initiatives.

“Out of my experience, I discovered that women suffer most because we live under a patriarchal system. I decided to work with disadvantaged women and children to overcome the systems that were largely made by men to favour men,” she explains.

Dr Karambu says when HIV/Aids was at its peak in early 2000, women whose husbands succumbed to the disease faced psychological and physical violence with their children being abused.

However, she says currently, most of those who seek shelter from IPI are victims of sexual and gender violence.

“Our approach at IPI is transforming the victims through training and mentorship into self-reliant individuals. We work with victims to identify the solution to their problems because such an approach is more sustainable,” she says.

Abandoned

In 2002, while a student in the US, Dr Karambu started working with a group of HIV positive women who made jewellery for sale.

“Most of these women had been neglected and abandoned by relatives due to stigma. Some of them were opting to commit suicide. I could fund-raise to support their jewellery, enabling them to eat well and educate their children. Out of the 95 women we started with, only three have passed on,” Dr Karambu says.

She says Kithoka Amani Children’s Home, provides a safe place for victims of violence besides helping them start life afresh to be self-reliant.

The home, she says, provides vocational skills including agriculture, catering, hairdressing, tailoring, soap making among others besides offering scholarships through university.

“Despite their past experiences, we train the children to believe in themselves and become leaders in their community. Indeed, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the children have been running the home by themselves. They have learnt how to solve their issues such that I concentrate on fundraising,” the IPI president said.

Dr Karambu expressed concern that sexual abuse of young girls and boys has become a pandemic like HIV/Aids in the early 2000 when she started out.

“The biggest concern now is the high number of teenage girls who are pregnant. We need concerted effort to address this new disease in the community and make our society safe for the children,” Dr Karambu says.","By

"Covid-19 has fanned cases of GBV, report shows","Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country in mid-March this year, cases of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) have been on the increase.

Across the nation, cases of SGBV have increased tremendously with girls and women forming the majority of victims.

Outgoing Chief Justice David Maraga was the first to raise the red flag over the acute increase of sexual violence relate cases filed in courts across the country.

On April 2, Mr Maraga noted that since March 13, when the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Kenya, sexual offences cases constituted 35.8 per cent of cases recorded since then.

A report released by the Federation of Women Lawyers-Kenya (Fida-Kenya) in May, also lifted the lid on rampant sexual violence against women.

The report, released by Fida-Kenya chairperson Nancy Ikunu showed Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa counties leading in GBV in the country since the outbreak of the pandemic.

It also listed Kakamega, Kajiado, Kiambu, Kilifi,Uasin-Gishu, Taita-Taveta, Vihiga, Bungoma, Lamu Siaya, Kitui and Nakuru as having recorded the highest number of GBV cases.

“The nature of GBV cases reported are mostly intimate partner violence, defilement and rape especially in Nairobi and Kisumu. Widow eviction and physical violence by in-laws was found to be prevalent in western region,” the report indicated.

The survey carried out by Fida-Kenya between April 15 and May 3, showed that a total of 289 cases were recorded.

Another survey by Trends and Insights for Africa (TIFA) showed that women are the majority victims of domestic violence at 52 per cent.","By

"‘Policare’ centres, a beacon of hope for SGBV survivors","Most victims and survivors of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) often blame the police for conducting shoddy investigations impeding their quest for justice.

As a result, many perpetrators of sexual violence go scot-free after being acquitted by courts for lack of evidence.

For a long time, survivors of SGBV and gender activists have been pushing for a one-stop centre to enhance reporting, evidence collection and accountability in sexual related cases.

During a webinar titled Prosecution of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Kenya organised by International Commission of Jurist (ICJ Kenya) 53-year-old SGBV survivor Jacqueline Mutere said the one-stop centres is the only way to ensure proper reporting and collection of evidence in sexual violence related cases.

She also rooted for the establishment of special courts for sexual violence cases just like there are special Lands and Corruption courts to ensure victims get prompt justice.

The campaign by the sexual violence victims and gender activists recently bore fruit after the Kenya National Police Service launched ‘Policare’ which is a one-stop SGBV center model established to ensure survivors of sexual violence can access counselling, medical and legal services from one place.

Integrated approach

Currently, two Policare centres have been set up in Nairobi and Makueni counties with a plan to establish more across the country.

This integrated approach, launched in August to handle SGBV cases is expected to encourage victims to report.

Currently, victims have to visit different institutions in the pursuit of justice which means they have to retell their trauma stories several time.

With Policare, a report is filed in one place where it can be accessed by all relevant institutions.

The model unit by the National Police Service (NPS) is designed to host all professionals involved in delivering justice to offenders while preserving the dignity of the victims plus the evidence they produce is expected to replace gender desks present in all stations.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua noted that the Policare model will be more of a system than a single physical identity intended to meet the dual objectives of improving care and support for survivors and increasing prosecution of the perpetrators.

Toll-free service

Complete with a 24-hour toll-free service for victims, Policare will host victims' interview rooms for women and children, crime records room, a triage, forensic evidence storage room, trauma centres, a room for medical examination and P3 issuance and male and female holding cells.

Public Service and Gender Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia last week while speaking in relation to the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence termed the launch of the Policare as timely.

“I commend the National Police Service for this innovative approach to handling SGBV,” she said.

High Court Judge Teresia Matheka recently observed survivors have high expectations on the Judiciary to dispense justice therefore, convictions are secured as a result of good investigations and strong evidence which she said sometimes lack when it comes to such cases.

"‘Policare’ centres, a beacon of hope for SGBV survivors","Most victims and survivors of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) often blame the police for conducting shoddy investigations impeding their quest for justice.

As a result, many perpetrators of sexual violence go scot-free after being acquitted by courts for lack of evidence.

For a long time, survivors of SGBV and gender activists have been pushing for a one-stop centre to enhance reporting, evidence collection and accountability in sexual related cases.

During a webinar titled Prosecution of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Kenya organised by International Commission of Jurist (ICJ Kenya) 53-year-old SGBV survivor Jacqueline Mutere said the one-stop centres is the only way to ensure proper reporting and collection of evidence in sexual violence related cases.

She also rooted for the establishment of special courts for sexual violence cases just like there are special Lands and Corruption courts to ensure victims get prompt justice.
