Musk took over the reins of the Social App on October 27, 2022 and barely one year in, there are loud murmurs that the world\u2019s fourth richest man is killing the app and its popularity.",

He then offered to purchase Twitter for $54.20 per share, or close to $44 billion, which was a significant premium over the stock price of the firm at the time. He claimed that he wanted to use the platform, which he believed had been mismanaged, to apply free speech ideals. He further stated that he would finance the transaction using both cash and borrowing.",
            "On April 25, Twitter decided to take Musk's offer. Twitter's Independent Board Chair, Bret Taylor said in a statement that the company's board \u201cconducted a thoughtful and thorough process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing.\u201d He said the proposed transaction was the best course of action for Twitter's stockholders because it would result in a significant cash premium.",

Musk continued to publicly discuss issues he noticed at Twitter, even though he later claimed he was still committed to the acquisition.",

Twitter declined to do so, but Judge Kathaleen McCormick decided to offer the two sides until the end of the month to hammer out an agreement. Around this time, Musk also wrote a note to advertisers, pledging Twitter will not become a \u201cfree-for-all hellscape.\u201d",

            "More women than men stand to lose their jobs by 2030 because of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, according to a new report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The report found that nearly eight in 10 women will be forced to move to another company or lose their job due to AI and automation.",
            "The study contends that lower-paying jobs will be the most affected by AI, noting that more women than men hold those positions. Industries that are expected to shrink the most are food services, customer service and sales, and office support. It further records that women who will be heavily impacted by AI development will need to expand their skill set to stay relevant in the workplace and move on to other positions.",
            "Also read:\u00a0Artificial Intelligence has a place in sport",
            "Black and Hispanic workers, workers without college degrees, and the youngest and oldest workers are also more likely to have to find new jobs by 2030, the study says. Across the low-wage industries, the report said 1.1 million jobs could be eliminated, but the number of higher-paying jobs could grow by upwards of 3.8 million.",
            "Another report, the UNESCO EQUALS Skills Coalition (2019), estimated that, on average, around the globe, women are 25 percent less likely than men to know how to use information and communications technology (ICT) for basic purposes, such as using simple arithmetic formulas on a spreadsheet. Meanwhile, men are four times likelier than women to have advanced skills such as computer programming.",
            "But Jessica Davis, a senior director at AI and news automation product, believes that AI will open more opportunities for women leadership in the field. Speaking last Sunday at Washington DC during a workshop on The Potential of AI in the Newsroom, Education, and Research: Practical Implementation Strategies, Ms Davis urged media houses to invest in AI too.",
            "\u201cAI is not going to replace journalists' jobs. In fact, it will make it better. Media houses should invest in AI. However, let them be socially responsible with information for authenticity and credibility. I hope we continue to harp on that. It's concerning and dangerous [that] you prompt these large language models and they feed you with information that you aren\u2019t sure about the source and you present it as your truth without further probing. Let us be very keen on how we handle the information we get from automated machines. We\u2019ve seen the blunders of AI when it\u2019s used in place of people.\u201d",

            "With multiple reports showing that more women are likely to lose their jobs to AI as compared to their male counterparts, there has been a consistent call on governments, the private sector, and other actors to make efforts and ensure women are not left behind in the digital economy. Organisations, citizens, policymakers, and academics are also increasingly encouraged to face this challenge of the future of work.",

        "author": "\nBy\u00a0\nDavid Aduda\n",
        "content": [
            "Public universities are opening their doors to first-year students as the government rolls out a funding model touted as a game-changer in higher education. It is, however, a moment for tough decisions. Uppermost in the minds of students and their parents is securing funding.",
            "Second is the courses the students will pursue, given the persistent practice of placing many in programmes they never chose, forcing them to spend their college years agonising about their career paths.",
            "The central issue, though, is funding. Higher education financing is being transformed in a manner that is causing disruptions in the supply and demand chain.",
            "From the outset, it must be acknowledged that transforming university funding is inevitable. The existing model has been overtaken by time and is unsustainable. Introduced in the 1990s under the Structural Adjustments Programmes, the model was based on a lower capitation level and fewer student population. The dynamics have changed.",
            "Photo credit: Nation Media Group",
            "The funding plan launched in May is based, among others, on the following principles. Every needy student should get access to full tuition. Two, allocation to students is graduated based on needs. Three, courses should be charged at the market rate to enable universities offer quality education and four, ensure universities operate with financial stability.",
            "Read: CS Machogu proposes debt write-off for struggling universities",
            "Based on these and from the supply side, public universities have introduced a unit-cost financing model, charging the courses at market rate and pushing that to students. The immediate effect is a steep rise in fees. Ideally, this should have happened a long time ago, but was always shelved for fear of the backlash from students, parents and the general public. This is why, though the universities introduced a Differentiated Unit Cost (DUC) financing model in 2016, the government bore most of the costs \u2013 80 per cent \u2013 while students paid a small fraction.",
            "DUC failed because of inadequate funding and delayed disbursement to the universities, pushing them to huge debts.",
            "The new model categorises learners into vulnerable, extremely needy, needy and less needy. Concomitantly, scholarships and loans will be differentiated, with students from vulnerable and extremely needy backgrounds getting generous scholarships compared to the others.",
            "Assessment for the scholarships and loans will be based on family socio-economic background, affirmative action and household composition and size.",
            "Read: Fees shocker for university students",
            "This is a marked departure from the age-old practice where all students who qualified for university and were admitted through KUCCPS automatically got funding.",
            "Read: New university funding explained",
            "On paper, this sounds great but in practice, it cannot be guaranteed because of financial and administrative challenges.",
            "Evidence is emerging that students have encountered numerous challenges when applying for funding. Accessing the University Funding Board portal, providing the requisite details and complying with the requirements has proved problematic. As at the end of last month, only 75,272 students out of 285,167 had successfully applied for scholarships and loans.",
            "The second challenge is financial. The government has not provided sufficient allocation to meet the needs of all qualifiers. Although the government increased allocations to the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb) for bursary and loans, it is inadequate. In the current financial year, the government set aside Sh30.3 billion to Helb, a significant increase from the previous Sh15 billion, but it still leaves a funding gap of Sh18 billion.",
            "It is these shortcomings that compelled Education CS Ezekiel Machogu to issue an order to public universities to admit all freshers without fees. Last week, the Cabinet also waived a requirement that a student must have a national identity card to secure funding. These are commendable but demonstrate the concern all along that the plan had not been properly thought through.",
            "Which leads to the question, what should we do to create a sustainable funding model for universities?",
            "The first step is to diagnose the real problem with funding and prescribe the correct medicine. The second is to fix logistical and technical hitches that surround the application and processing of scholarships and loans. Third is increased funding to Helb.",
            "Beyond this, focus should shift to the universities and spur them to think carefully about their sustenance and stop depending on the Treasury. The practice across the world is that universities raise money to remain afloat.",
            "In the past, universities thrived on parallel degree programmes to raise cash from fee-paying students, but that fizzled out.",
            "Universities are hubs for ideation, research and experimentation and knowledge production \u2013 great endowments they ought to leverage on to raise funds. But this hardly happens. Paradoxically, many lecturers run successful consultancies and research projects but at individual level because the universities do not have institutionalised structures for those. Time is now to create structures for institutional consultancies, research and projects.",
            "Scientific research leading to patents should take centre at the universities. Similarly, the institutions should engage in practical research that provides solutions to the nation\u2019s challenges. It is questionable, for example, why the universities offer courses in agriculture but cannot help the country through research to attain food sufficiency.",
            "Universities should also review their programmes and cut out those that are redundant, duplicated and obsolete, rethink their cost structures and rationalise expenditure, including trimming staff.",
            "While acknowledging initiatives to revitalise university through new funding approaches, pertinent challenges persist. Thus, debate on university funding has to continue until sustainable models are attained.",

            "In a heated exchange on Twitter between the Principal Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs, Roseline Njogu, and a group of Kenyans living overseas, the ministry was thrust in bad light after it emerged that the government had nominated individuals who are not based abroad to a technical committee to engage the Capital Markets Authority on Diaspora Investment Promotion.",
            "In a leaked memo, the Principal Secretary for Investment, Trade and Industry, Abubakar Hassan Abubakar, acknowledges nominees who had apparently been seconded from the Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs, purporting to represent Kenyans in the Diaspora, into what he described as a Technical Working Group\u2014TWG\u2014to discuss with Kenya Markets Capital Authority on Diaspora Investment Strategies.",

            "Kenyans in the Diaspora were outraged to see the government roll out such a serious plan without including any of them but preferred dealing with what they described as questionable groups operating in Nairobi yet masquerading as representatives of the Diaspora.",
            "Ms Margaret Rulhoff, from Germany, questioned how Kenya Diaspora Alliance, an entity that operates in Nairobi, under former Rangwe MP, Shem Ochuodho, qualifies to represent the Diaspora in discussing its investments without consulting or including anyone from abroad.",
            "Ms Rulhoff also questioned the gender imbalance in the appointments, pointing out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs acted contrary to the expectations of those living overseas.",
            "The debate broke out on Saturday after the Daily Nation reported a civil case initiated against the African Union Commission and its head by Dr Ochuodho after he was suspended as a member of the continental body\u2019s Economic Social and Cultural Council for allegedly contravening the AU\u2019s code of ethics and conduct.",
            "Also Read: Remittances from Kenyans in diaspora drop in 2023",
            "\u201cMonths ago, some Diasporans protested when an organisation representing the Kenyan diaspora was selected to be part of a technical team that is to help mobilise diaspora investments. This team was appointed by the government\u2019s permanent secretary. Many diasporans had their reservations, they mainly complained about lack of transparency in this selection, gender imbalance and the fact that this organisation sits in Nairobi and not the diaspora. It is now being reported that the @_AfricanUnion has now suspended the chairman of that organisation. The reasons for suspension are cited to be a breach of code of AU\u2019s code of ethics and conduct,\u201d said Ms Rulhoff.",
            "Ms Njogu responded, \u201cMudge, this is unnecessarily alarmist. Diaspora investments are not channeled through a government entity, not even the committee you referenced. The committee (being reconstituted as I indicated earlier) is mandated to advise, not invest or take anyone\u2019s money.\u201d",
            "Former IEBC Commissioner, Dr Roselyn Akombe,\u00a0 now based in New York, USA, pointed out that it is \u201cinteresting that while Kenyans in the Diaspora have their own active organizations and leaders, the government chooses to work with some non-Diaspora based individuals of questionable repute. And expect that we will then channel our hard-earned money through such mechanisms.\u201d",
            "The PS\u2019 response seemed to outrage many other Diasporans with the Chair of KDA-USA, Saisi Marasa, based in Maryland, USA, expressing his frustrations with the government\u2019s failure to have its priorities right.",
            "Dr Marasa quipped, \u201cWhat a bad start on this noble effort with our government. Who is advising the PS? Where are the representatives of various diaspora organisations including the Christian communities, and diaspora Sacco?\u201d",
            "Peter Makori from Missouri, USA, accused the ministry and the individuals they were working with of capitalising on poor coordination of the various diaspora groups to cause confusion and advance their own selfish interests.",
            "David Ogega from Georgia, USA told Ms Njogu, \u201cMadam Secretary, I appreciate your response to this\u2026there is a major disconnect between the government\u2019s approach to the Diaspora with the Diaspora itself. You guys seem to believe you have this figured out on your own, not so.....\u201d",

            "Initially, as a junta, the two leaders let their differences boil under the table. It had been common knowledge that their rivalry was playing even in deals they made with outside entities, such as Russia. After the framework\u00a0was signed, it became an open secret.",
            "But they have also been met with a hardline civilian movement which wants nothing from the military in running the politics of the country. Every other player, including the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the US have demanded a civilian-led government.",
            "As it is, Sudan is suspended from voting at the African Union and the UN, but it chairs IGAD, the regional bloc in the Horn.",
            "So how did the junta crack? Al-Burhan had been trying to isolate Hemedti for a while. One\u00a0indicator\u00a0was when Khartoum signed an updated version of the peace agreement with the armed movements in Juba, South Sudan. Sovereignty Council member Shamsuddin Kabbashi signed the agreement on behalf of the government, instead of Hemedti, who had signed the first version with the movements in October 2020.",
            "Al-Burhan also stopped Hemedti from receiving security, diplomatic and criminal reports he had been routinely receiving. In fact, Hemedti was also denied a role in dealing with the country\u2019s peace bids.",
            "But Hemedti isn\u2019t new to the game. Some five years before Bashir'ss\u00a0ouster, he was consolidating his influence in the capital, Khartoum. He created the RSF, an offshoot of the Janjaweed militia feared for its atrocities in Darfur in the 2003 rebellion, which Bashir crushed and earned an indictment at the International Criminal Court.",
            "RSF was integrated into the formal security service in 2013. And after the coup in 2019, the army and the RSF maintained their relationship against Hamdok's transitional\u00a0government.",
            "Hamdok won the hostility of the duo, together, after he sought to solve the problems of his country's economy, and eliminate\u00a0depletion of the local currency, by several decisions including transferring military investments into joint stock companies.",
            "This was rejected by the military, which said\u00a0instead that those companies pay the prescribed taxes without being put under civilian supervision. Hamdok also clashed with the RSF over an initiative that included attaching those forces to the military and regularising their status. Ultimately, the duo \u2014Hemedti and Al-Burhan\u2014 agreed to oust Hamdok in October 2021.",
            "That appears to be last time their interests converged - they have been differing on how to move the transitional programme forward.",
            "They also haven\u2019t agreed on key foreign policy changes such as Hemedti\u2019s controversial decision to meet with Israeli officials without his partner\u2019s knowledge. This was seen as Hemedti\u2019s bid to advance his domestic political agenda by seeking allies abroad. Hemedti has also strengthened ties with Russians and has travelled to that country\u00a0recently. He\u00a0is said to enjoy security cooperation for the RSF.",
            "When Hamdok was ousted, Hemedti did not\u00a0comment\u00a0publicly\u00a0even though it was clear he too didn\u2019t like the PM.",
            "He now prefers flirting\u00a0with the streets by raising demands for change and demanding civil rule. Even if he finally agrees to\u00a0civilian rule, perhaps he knows playing 'good cop' may save him from any punitive measures on his conduct by the new, civilian-led government."

        "title": "Explainer: What you should know about carbon credits",
        "author": "\nBy\u00a0\nLilys Njeru\n",
        "content": [
            "In the face of escalating climate change impacts and the growing demand for businesses to reduce their carbon footprints, interest in carbon credits is growing.",
            "The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015 were international pacts that laid out international CO2 emissions goals. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that captures and retains heat close to earth and is responsible for roughly 80 per cent of global warming.",
            "While the Kyoto Protocol required only developed countries to reduce emissions, the latter recognised that climate change is a shared problem and called on all countries to set emission targets.",
            "Under the Paris Agreement, countries are requested to submit new or updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) every five years, starting in 2020. According to Climate Watch, a platform that captures data on countries climate progress, Kenya emits about 70 million tonnes of CO2 per year.",
            "At the opening ceremony of the inaugural Africa Climate summit currently ongoing at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC), President Ruto said that carbon sinks were an unparalleled economic goldmine.",
            "\u201cThe restoration and expansion of Africa's natural carbon sinks are not just an environmental imperative; they are an unparalleled economic goldmine. They have the potential to absorb millions of tons of CO2 annually which should translate into billions of dollars, improved livelihoods,\u201d he said.",
            "As President Ruto steers the discourse around carbon credits, last week, more than 500 civil society organisations implored him to steer the conference away from carbon markets and other strategies that they perceive as \u201cfalse solutions.\u201d",
            "These groups argue that such approaches are predominantly driven by Western interests. They urged Dr Ruto to consider alternative solutions such as climate justice, reparations, adaptation and mitigation finance that are more inclusive and sustainable.",
            "And despite the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding carbon credits, there remains a significant lack of understanding about what they are. Here is what you need to know:",
            "What are carbon credits?",
            "Carbon credits are permits that allow the owner to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. One tradeable carbon credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas reduced, sequestered, or avoided.",
            "Carbon credits can be bought by countries as part of their NDC strategy, by corporations with sustainability targets, and by private individuals that want to compensate for their carbon footprint. Within this framework, companies are allocated carbon credits, which diminish over time. If they have a surplus, they have the option to trade it with other companies. Companies like Tesla have sold carbon credits to other car manufacturers.",
            "How do they work?",
            "Carbon credits are generated by projects carrying out emissions reduction or removal outside a country\u2019s boundary. These credits are transferred to be accounted for within the boundary, often \u2013 but not always \u2013 by financial purchase through a market. Carbon credits are most often created through agricultural or forestry practices, although a credit can be made by nearly any project that reduces, avoids, destroys, or captures emissions.",
            "How do companies use carbon credits?",
            "By paying someone else to either reduce their emissions or capture their carbon, companies can compensate for their environmental footprint and even, in the most ambitious cases, use carbon credits to get to carbon-neutral status.",
            "There are three basic types of carbon credits: those from reduced emissions, removed emissions (carbon capture and planting forests), and avoided emissions (for example refraining from cutting down rainforests).",
            "What is the relationship between carbon credits and carbon markets?",
            "Carbon markets are trading schemes that create financial incentives for activities that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. In these schemes, emissions are quantified into carbon credits that can be bought and sold.",
            "What is a carbon market place?",
            "The carbon marketplace is where carbon credits and offsets are bought and sold. It functions as a platform for individuals, companies, and governments to purchase credits or offsets to compensate for their own emissions.",
            "Why are carbon markets and carbon credits controversial?",
            "Quarters of climate scientists, experts and civil societies argue that carbon credits do nothing to mitigate global heating and some were also linked to human rights abuses, including forced relocations and killings of environmental defenders.",
            "Other carbon offset projects in the unregulated carbon market have been found to be fraudulent and exploitative. Further, they are opaque and lacks standardisation."

            "Mr Mwinzi explains that under the current Marriage Act 2014, there are certain grounds that petitioners seeking a divorce have to prove in order to be granted a divorce.",
            "These include adultery, desertion, cruelty and irretrievable breakdown of marriage.",
            "\u201cFor instance, to prove adultery, you have to show that a third party was\u00a0involved in your marriage. This makes it necessary for the third party to become part of the divorce matter so that they are not condemned unheard. In fact, it is\u00a0more difficult to prove adultery in court than to prove someone owes you money because adultery happens in private,\u201d he adds.",
            "In his experience, parties would at times have to hire private investigators so that they can catch their spouses in the act.",

            "Here, we look at how climate change produces extreme heat, how scientists evaluate heatwaves and the risks to human health:",
            "Extreme heat is defined from a baseline of the average temperature in any one location, which varies widely across the world.",
            "A primary school student uses a portable fan to keep cool in a classroom during hot weather in Banda Aceh on May 15, 2023. Scientists say global warming is exacerbating adverse weather, with many countries experiencing deadly heatwaves and temperatures hitting records across Southeast and South Asia in recent weeks.\nPhoto credit: Courtesy | AFP",
            "So a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) could be record-breaking in parts of Canada in spring, but might be below average for the same period in the Middle East.",
            "\"Greenhouse gases trapping heat are at the root of the problem,\" said Martin Jucker, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales' Climate Change Research Centre.",
            "Gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide play a crucial role in stopping heat from being reflected or lost from our atmosphere.",
            "When this process is balanced, it keeps the planet at a livable temperature.",
            "But an unsustainable increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere means more heat is being trapped, creating an overall global warming effect and other climate anomalies.",
            "For example, warming air holds more moisture, which produces stronger and more frequent storms.",
            "This photograph taken on May 30, 2023 shows a view of Hanoi city after some street lights were turned off to save electricity as demand for air conditioning soars. Vietnam, which relies on hydropower for almost half its energy needs, has struggled with a series of heatwaves since early May and the mercury reached a record high, while rivers and reservoirs at hydroelectric power plants have dried up.\nPhoto credit: Courtesy | AFP",
            "Overall, climate change is strengthening the duration, intensity and geographical reach of heatwaves, scientists say.",
            "The problem is made worse in some places by the way cities are built -- the so-called heat island effect, where urban conglomerations are warmer than surrounding rural areas.",
            "This happens because cities with too little greenery and too much concrete, asphalt and other building materials absorb heat and often offer insufficient shade.",
            "The use of cooling technologies like air conditioners creates surging demand for energy, including the fossil fuels that are behind the climate crisis in the first place.",
            "To determine climate change's role in any given event, experts use a technique called attribution science.",
            "They simulate a world with and without climate change, using historical and more recent measurements, or computer models.",
            "Comparing the two then \"gives us a measure of how much more likely a given extreme is under climate change\", Jucker told AFP.",
            "Findings for over 500 events have been collected by the organisation Carbon Brief, with most shown to have been made more severe or more likely because of climate change.",

            "Just a handful, including some floods, droughts and extreme cold, have been found to have no clear link to human activity, while in other cases experts found the evidence inconclusive.",
            "\"Every heatwave in the world is now made stronger and more likely to happen because of human-caused climate change,\" according to Friederike Otto, a scientist at Imperial College London and pioneer of attribution methodology.",
            "Exposure to higher-than-normal temperatures produces health problems ranging from heatstroke and dehydration to cardiovascular stress.",
            "Those with pre-existing heart conditions are especially vulnerable, as the body's response to heat is to pump more blood to the skin to help with cooling.",
            "Risk is also unevenly distributed, with the elderly and the unwell more vulnerable, and those who work outdoors or live in places without air conditioning more likely to suffer.",
            "The deadliest heat combines soaring temperatures with high humidity -- the moist air undermines the body's ability to cool off by sweating.",
            "In May, a study warned a fifth of the world's population would be exposed to extreme and potentially life-threatening heat by the end of the century on our current climate track.",

            "Menstruation is an uncomfortable, painful, inconvenient and expensive experience for many women and girls. It occurs once a month for approximately three to seven days; about three months a year.",
            "Those with no access to menstruation products are left to their own devices to manage their menstruation cycles, with many unable to participate meaningfully in daily life due to the difficulty of managing bleeding.",
            "Many girls resort to using unhygienic substitutes such as rags, newspapers, banana leaves, and even cow dung. Worse still, others turn to prostitution to get these essential products.",
            "Unfortunately, period poverty \u2013 the lack of access to menstrual products \u2013 increases the risk of toxic shock syndrome, cervical cancer and other dangerous infections according to research.",
            "While period poverty has always been the stark reality for some, Covid-19 has exacerbated menstruation-related challenges, especially for women and girls from urban slums and poor rural communities.",
            "Menstrual hygiene",
            "Globally, women and girls\u2019 rights activists are asking governments to integrate sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls in Covid-19 responses. In Kenya, at least 2.6 million girls currently require menstrual hygiene materials \u2013 pads, underwear and soap, according to Unesco.",
            "In April last year, local women rights organisations petitioned the government to spend at least 30 per cent share of Covid-19 funds on gender responsive strategies including distributing cash relief, food and sanitary towels to vulnerable women and girls.",
            "The pandemic aside, the menstrual hygiene situation in Kenya has been, and remains dire. Thousands of adolescent girls have to contend with hurdles as they go through formal schooling. In September last year, a school girl in Bomet committed suicide after her teacher humiliated her for staining her uniform during her menses.",
            "It is sad this happened nine years after Kenya launched the Sanitary Towels Programme in 2011 \u2013 an initiative meant to provide pads to needy girls in public schools. It is the same year Kenya made sanitary towels tax-free.",
            "Unfortunately, some girls do not receive the free sanitary towels. The government in 2019, admitted a lack of funds to provide sanitary towels as required by law, with Education CS George Magoha saying the Sh470 million provided can only supply girls for four months.",
            "Lack of access to sanitary products means many girls drop out of school while on their period, putting them at greater risk of child marriage and early pregnancy.",
            "In 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Basic Education Amendment Act (2016) placing the responsibility of providing free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels on the government, to reduce the number of girls missing school.",
            "In 2019, the government launched the Menstrual Hygiene Policy 2019-30 to among other things, ensure women and girls have access to safe and hygienic products.",
            "All these measures were aimed at ending period poverty. However, that goal is yet to be met with Education CS last year admitting that the government scheme had not met its target, and many girls are still missing school during their menses.",
            "Disadvantaged girl",
            "The United Nations estimates that as many as 20 million girls drop out of schools (globally) every year because they cannot deal with their menstrual flows. The Education ministry estimates that a girl absent from school for four days a month loses 13 learning days equivalent to two weeks per term.",
            "This means that in an academic year, a disadvantaged girl loses up to 39 learning days, something that could be remedied by proper implementation of the sanitary towels program.",
            "Access to sanitary products would also be of limited help if schools don\u2019t have the supporting infrastructure, such as separate bathrooms for girls with doors and locks for privacy, a luxury in most of our rural public schools.",
            "Menstruation is a global issue and there is evidence of action to address its challenges. Last year, Scotland became the first country in the world to provide free period products for all women, while Germany reduced tax on sanitary towels from 19 per cent to seven per cent.",
            "Canada, Australia and India followed suit. France, Spain, Poland and Austria have also lowered tax on sanitary products. A handful of US States have also passed laws mandating free period products be provided in schools. The UK government too, rolled out free period products in all primary and secondary schools in England last year.",
            "Kenya\u2019s menstrual policies all look good on paper, but wouldn\u2019t work in a real-world environment if not managed well. With proper management, we too, like Scotland, can make sanitary products free for all. Every woman is entitled to safe and hygienic menstrual facilities, and the right to manage menstruation without shame or stigma.",
            "It is time to change the narrative, girls and women have suffered enough.",

        "content": [
            "Reports that some madrassa in Kilifi have been turned into sexual abuse dens have sparked outrage, even as it emerged that some Muslim leaders have been concealing the cases to prevent justice for the victims in the name of protecting the image of their region.",
            "In an interview with Nation.Africa, Kenya Muslim Youth Alliance (Kimya) chairperson Ustadh Mahamood Hambal said sexual exploitation has become rampant in madrasas. \u201cSometimes teachers are reported to sexually exploit children while in other incidents it is among children. But different authorities do not handle the cases with the seriousness they deserve,\u201d he said.",
            "Mr Hambal, a human rights activist, said the journey for Muslim activists to fight for the rights of sexual and gender-violence (SGBV) victims is a matter of life and death, given the move by a section of leaders to defend the image of the religion.",
            "\u201cWe condemn sexual exploitation in madrasas and have always advocated justice for the victims through the legal procedure, but sometimes there is a lot of resistance to the cases because some people always want to use their money, leadership powers and influence to conceal them.\u201d",
            "He cited a Malindi case where an ustadh (madrasa teacher) was accused of molestation. Even so, a section of leaders opposed the move to have him arrested and charged, to protect the image of the religion. \u201cWe stood firm to fight for justice for the victim and we welcomed the decision by the court to jail the perpetrator for life.\u201d",
            "He said some leaders in the Muslim fraternity were afraid of speaking against sexual abuse in the madrasa for fear of intimidation and losing their jobs. \u201cAs Muslim activists, we are torn between intimidation, threats to life, and standing for the truth. Some leaders are good at intimidating madrasa teachers and they would recommend they get sacked or transferred to conceal the cases,\u201d he said.",
            "An ustadh gets a minimum salary of Sh10,000 and a maximum of Sh15,000, while some earn between Sh3,000 and Sh5,000. \u201cMany teachers have bowed to threats and intimidations for fear of losing their jobs,\u201d he added.",
            "Mr Hambal, however, added that some Muslim leaders and activists have taken the lead in condemning SGBV in madrasas and society. He said even after engaging in sexual abuse of minors, the madrasa teachers always move to seek employment in other places as they continue to exploit more children. He termed that irresponsible and undisciplined.",
            "The religious leader challenged the leadership of madrasas to interrogate the people they employ and get their background information before offering them jobs. \u201cAll madrasa teachers seeking employment should produce recommendation letters from their previous institutions, stating the reasons for their transfers. It should not be the case where they are allowed to work because of their rich educational background or they know how to conduct prayers,\u201d he added, calling upon the police to refuse corrupt deals and be in the lead to ensure the victims get justice.",
            "A Kilifi anti-gender violence champion Mumina Alaso from Prison/Kiwandani village said most madrasa teachers are \u201cwolves in sheep skin with a history of sexual abuse\u201d. She cited an incident where one teacher lived with three girls and his wife, only for the community to learn that he was sexually abusing the girls.",
            "Read: Defilement: The silent epidemic",
            "\u201cParents have always trusted the madrasa teachers because they allow them to be with their children. We did not know the ustadh was a predator until when he left the madrasa and moved to Mitangoni in Kilifi South where he defiled two girls,\u201d she said.",
            "On November 16, 2018, while sentencing a madrasa teacher for molestation, Malindi Principal Magistrate Silivia Wewa said such cases were rampant and urged residents to report them for legal action. She said a probation report revealed many unreported sodomy cases.",
            "In a recent incident, a girl from the Kilifi Educational Centre, famously known as Khairat Madrasa in Kilifi town, walked to the Kilifi Police Station and reported rampant exploitation by an ustadh. The 14-year-old and her friend reported that their madrasa teacher had been molesting them.",
            "The girls were from two primary schools in Kilifi township but attended the Khairat Educational Centre for madrasa classes. The suspect, aged 38, was arrested on the same day and released after some hours on a Sh20,000 police bond.",
            "ODPP on the spot",
            "The girls\u2019 parents were shocked to be informed that the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) had advised the police to close the file as the report by the children did not amount to sexual offenses as captured by the Sexual Offenses Act. They expressed their disappointment at how the ODDP handled the matter and termed it a scheme to protect the teacher and the image of the madrasa.",
            "One of the parents said the police informed her they had closed the matter. \u201cIt has been over one month since my daughter reported the matter, and no action was taken against the perpetrator because the police arrested him and later released him some hours later. However, the investigation officer informed me that they had concluded their investigations, even recorded the complainant and witness statement, although the Director of Public Prosecutions asked them not to charge the suspect,\u201d she said.",
            "According to the mother, the daughter revealed that the ustadh always caressed them. \u201cThe child could not hold the sexual abuse anymore and reported the perpetrator to his seniors, but they did not take immediate action and she walked to the police to report,\u201d she said.",
            "Also read: Defiled: Time ripe to act on girl child\u2019s silent screams",
            "The mother said she was shocked that her daughter did not inform them and opted to go straight to the police. \u201cOur children have been suffering in silence. The reason my daughter decided to act even without informing us, parents, was that she couldn\u2019t believe anybody but the law.\u201d",
            "Another parent disclosed that her daughter would refuse to go to the madrasa but could not state why. \u201cI could force my daughter to go to the madrasa, but she did not disclose that the ustadh was abusing them.\u201d",
            "One victim disclosed in an interview that most children are afraid of the ustadh and could not dare speak about the incidents as he would punish them heavily. \u201cAll disciplinary cases like failure to recite the Quran, absenteeism, and failure to attend Maulid events are reported to the ustadh who beats us on the shoulders using a sisal rope,\u201d she said.",
            "The minor disclosed that she reported the matter before the start of the 2023 Ramadhan. \u201cI told a lady teacher that the ustadh was molesting us, and she said there was nothing she could do and that she would inform her senior to address it. However, none of them intervened. The ustadh continued molesting us,\u201d she said.",
            "Kilifi North Sub-County police boss Kenneth Maina said the matter was under investigation. \u201cA minor went to the Kilifi police station and reported that she had been sexually assaulted by her madrasa teacher for a long time. Two more children came out with similar complaints,\u201d he said.",
            "The children were aged between 10 and 13.",
            "Mr Maina confirmed that the DPP had directed them not to charge the suspect. He said that on June 22, the DPP responded to a letter by the Kilifi Officer Commanding Station for directions on the matter. The DPP\u2019s letter said the minors had complained of being touched on the hands, legs, and hips, and these were not sexual violations, Mr Maina added. \u201cThe DPP said there was no evidence to charge the ustadh according to\u00a0Sexual 2(a) of the Sexual Offences Act,\u201d he said, adding that it is challenging to trace madrasa teachers as they are not under the Teachers Service Commission.",

CFK Africa is an international nongovernmental organisation with offices in Kenya and the US. Mr Okoro has become its fifth executive director since it was founded in 2001.",
            "In an interview with\u00a0Nation.Africa, Mr Okoro says he will continue working with the\u00a0community to improve public health, educational outcomes, and economic opportunities in informal settlements.\u00a0He will further strengthen initiatives that empower women and girls in Kibra and other informal settlements.",

            "\u201cIt is my wish to see many more women benefit from this TVET and ICT programme. I am looking at ensuring about 70 per cent of these opportunities go to young women. It is high time we dealt with the gender gap in TVET courses by ensuring more girls and women are given the opportunities.\u201d",

            "A resident of Kibera, Mr Okoro first\u00a0volunteered with the organisation as a youth leader after the 2007-08 post-election violence. He has since risen through the ranks to the top. Along the way, he became a peer mentor, administrative assistant, project officer, programme coordinator, and most recently deputy director.",
            "In 2018, he co-founded the organisation\u2019s Best Schools Initiative with Professor Steve Arnold and has since collaborated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to strengthen its research objectives.

I have seen firsthand how these efforts provide opportunities to residents of Kenya\u2019s informal settlements, and I look forward to working with the team to expand and enrich them to benefit even more communities in the coming years,\u201d he says.",
            "\u201cWhen I reflect on where I came from, I see that it\u2019s not just my story, but also the story of the community that shaped me and gave me opportunities I might not have had. I look forward to expanding those same opportunities to help the next generation of young leaders in informal settlements in Kibera and beyond.\u201d",

            "Shortly, a man in shorts and a brown sleeveless shirt walks down. Over his shoulder is a beaded skin. His foot is covered with grey tyre sandals and a knife is strapped to his shorts. He holds an arrow. This is Mambosi Jioja, the chairperson of the Sonai Hadzabe group.",
            "The Hadzabe are communal, have a nomadic lifestyle and depend on game meat and wild fruits. For the last 30 years, however, they have never moved from here, Mambosi says. They live behind the hillock. Mambosi leads us up.",

            "I ask him if a snake has stung anyone in the recent past. His response in the negative is consoling. He says they only bite if provoked. The Hadzabe don't eat snakes as many presume, Mambosi says.",

            "\u201cOur roles still stand. I can\u2019t go hunting. Neither can he go collecting fruits or tubers; that is my work. That is how it is. That\u2019s a culture passed down to us,\u201d she reckons.",
            "Katarina Hassan digs out a tuber on June 2, 2023.",

She says the harsh weather conditions and conversion of parts of the forest to farms have disturbed the area's ecology, resulting in dwindled production and presence of their wild food.The wild animals they hunted\u2014antelopes, wildebeests, baboons, dik-dik, buffaloes and zebras\u2014have gone missing.",

            "\u201cThese days, you walk for long until you get tired and hunger pangs and thirst overwhelm you. So, you\u2019re forced to excavate tubers to eat. They are succulent and quench your thirst,\u201d says Maliseli, whose dressing is like a billboard of the animals they hunt.",
            "Katarina Hassan holds a tuber on June 2, 2023.",

            "The community has embraced other food. \u201cWe eat rice and ugali with vegetables,\u201d says Katarina.",

            "Here, nearly everything is done communally. It is the community chairperson who receives any gift on their behalf, including money and food, then he shares it out.",
            "If it\u2019s food, it has to be adequate enough to feed all of them. If it\u2019s water, sourced from a borehole miles away, the money ought to be enough to buy at least one jerrycan of 20 litres for each household at Tsh1,000 (Ksh57.58).",
            "True to Katarina\u2019s submission, during my short time with the community, some foreign tourists gift them with maize flour, assorted indigenous vegetables, tomatoes and some money to buy cooking oil. Mambosi leads the distribution from the baobab tree, the special meeting point.",
            "The women stretch their hands to receive the food. But there is something unique about this whole exercise.",
            "I have witnessed food distribution exercises in Kenya\u2019s Turkana, Baringo and Narok counties and I have never seen a man run to the house to bring a sack to the wife to collect the food. Maybe, I have not been that keen.",
            "Gender power balance is so obvious here. In a generation where UN Women keeps calling for redistribution of household responsibilities, how this community does it is intriguing.",
            "I ask Katarina about the power relations between men and women in their community. \u201cSisi ni wakali sana kwa wanaume. Sisi ndio tuna uamuzi. Uamuzi ndio wa kwetu. Tukiamua hii, sisi wanawake tumeamua, tusipoamua basi tunaacha (We are more powerful than men. We are the decision-makers and when we decide, our decision is final),\u201d she says.",
            "The power is rooted in marriage culture. Unlike in most cultures across the world where a woman moves into the man\u2019s home once they marry, here, it is the opposite.",
            "\u201cWell, a man woos the woman but she only marries him if he accepts her terms and conditions,\u201d explains Katarina.",
            "\u201cOnce he accepts, she builds her house with the support of her mother and other women. The man then joins her. It is her house. Not the man\u2019s,\u201d she says.",
            "The women also determine how much should be paid as reverse dowry. Years ago, they had to bring not less than three baboons, rolls of tobacco and honey, Katarina says.",
            "A section of Sonai settlement.",
            "But these days, due to scarcity of the wild animals, they are allowed to pay in many necklaces, as preferred by the women, and honey.",
            "\u201cThe young man will make efforts to find honey, tobacco and necklaces,\u201d explains Mambosi, the Sonai settlement\u2019s chairperson. \u201cThe bride\u2019s mother and sister to the groom will only welcome them into the house after the man has fulfilled all the dowry requirements.\u201d",
            "While the women help the bride to construct the house for the incoming husband, the men prepare the groom for his household responsibilities by giving him a honey bag, a skin or hide, knife and arrows, Mambosi says.",
            "So in the case of divorce, the man only leaves with what he came with. That is his only possession. \u201cThe children belong to the women. They may have his surname, but it is the women who call the shots,\u201d insists Katarina.",
            "Apalii Saitoti Thufu, Katarina\u2019s husband, proudly acknowledges the power of women here. \u201cIf she tells you to leave, you\u2019ll leave. If she allows you to leave with the children then fine,\u201d he says.",
            "In jest, I interject: \u201cBut you can refuse to leave.\u201d",
            "He quickly counters: \u201cHow can you refuse to go, yet the house is hers. Even if you were to go with the children, where would you host them when you don\u2019t have a house?\u201d",
            "\u201cIs there a problem building a house for yourself and the children?\u201d I ask.",
            "He responds: \u201cNo, no! It\u2019s not in our tradition for a man to build a house. That\u2019s the work of women. If she chases you away, you return to your parents. And you\u2019ll just sleep in the open or create some sort of a structure to sleep under.\u201d",
            "Apalii says he was born in Ghorofani, another settlement in Karatu District and moved to Sonai where his wife built a house. Together, they have two children.",
            "I ask Katarina the main reason why women chase away the men and she says: \u201cKama nimechoka kuchimba mizizi si nitakuwa mkali? (How can I not be rattled if I am bogged down with excavating roots?)\u201d",
            "Maliseli is a victim. He was born here but had a wife in Endamaka, another settlement in Karatu district. They had two children.",
            "But he says he recently returned to his parents, after disagreeing with his wife. She remained with the children. He says he hasn\u2019t seen the children since he left, but given the chance, he can visit them.",
            "He struggled to respond to the query of where he lives. \u201cMimi naishi kama mimi, kama mimi, kama mimi (As for me, I, I, I live).\u201d",
            "Unlike in many parts of Tanzania and Kenya, where female genital mutilation and child marriages are prevalent, among the Hadzabe, such harmful practices are zero. They are detested. However, girls go through a rite of passage.",
            "A Hadzabe. Girls wear headbands once they begin menstruating.",
            "\u201cIf a girl taints her clothes, we will know she has started her menses,\u201d explains Mindi Saitoti, \u201cor if she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, she will ask her mother.\"",
            "\"The same day she makes the report, the women contribute beaded necklaces and a headband to decorate her. That shows she is mature.",
            "\"But it doesn\u2019t mean she is ready for marriage. If a man intends to marry her, her mother must approve of it and they never do so unless she is above 18 years,\u201d she says.",
            "Mindi is married and has three children. She and her husband, Tabashi Chalesi, were born here. She built a house a few yards away from her parents\u2019 and they live happily.",
            "I am curious to find out if Tabashi finds it strange to live near his in-laws. But it sounds like a weird question.\u201cStrange, how?\u201d he asks.",
            "\u201cWe are okay. What is the problem with that?\u201d",
            "I rest my case. Meanwhile, the men have their own way of telling when a woman is ready for marriage.",

            "\u201cMy former husband tried to convince my father that I should go back to his homestead since he had paid the dowry in full. I remained defiant and one day, he came in the company of 11 other men.

I slept in the bush hungry but was lucky, the following day, to be offered shelter by a Good Samaritan,\u201d she explains through an interpreter since she has never stepped in a classroom.",

Not long before, she had been evicted from her home after her husband\u2019s death by his brother. She needed help, desperately.",
            "\u201cMy brother-in-law told me that I had no business staying in that home and that the property didn't belong to me. He took all my properties, including land and forced me out. He was verbally violent.\u201d",

Being a succession matter, the organisation\u2019s legal assistant sat with her and guided her through a mediation process that took place between family members and the woman in the presence of the area chief.",
            "After a successful resolution of the succession issue, Mary was able to go back to her land. Today she can use, control and manage the land the same way she did when her husband was alive.",
            "Mary is one of two women who have so far benefited from the Haki Ardhi tool that was launched by the Kenya Land Alliance (KLA) with support from Rainforest Foundation UK and TMG Research gGmbH - TMG Think Tank for Sustainability.",
            "KLA chief executive officer Faith Alubbe observed that women and widows particularly suffer in silence because they are often punished and ostracised by society when they report disinheritance, eviction from their homes, and denial of access to and use of land, among other violations, to the location chief or police.",

One is an online platform that works through the Shibuye-based organisation, which documents cases and conducts follow-ups and referrals to suitable entities to ensure their completion. The second component, launched on June 20, is an SMS platform for alerts and quick responses using a free USSD code that can be used by any person in need.",

Even when I call for\u00a0barazas, very few or no women attend, yet these are the spaces where they can come and get information about land justice and their rights. The women only come to me after discovering their husbands have sold their land and squandered the funds, which in many cases I beseech them to forgive and move on, then make the husbands commit not to keep secrets and to involve their wives in land issues.\u201d",

Some men have rejected attempts by their sisters to inherit land. Some widows have been kicked out of their matrimonial property, while others have refused to be 'inherited'.",

Breaking down harmful stereotypes and bringing men and boys into the conversation are two of the most important norm changes we collectively need to nurture.",

One in five women have suffered from female genital mutilation (FGM) in Kenya and 23 per cent of the nation\u2019s girls are married before their 18th birthday, while four per cent are married before their 15th birthday.",
            "The exact numbers of rape and sexual assaults are difficult to assert due to reluctance or fear for victims to report it, and inefficiency in addressing the reports adequately because of lack of capacity and resources and sometimes will.",
            "We are daily witnesses to \u2018rape culture\u2019, sometimes even silent bystanders. Society has entrenched the use of misogynistic language, the objectification of women\u2019s bodies on screens, indifference to consent, and the glamorisation of violence in advertisements.",
            "Victim-blaming",
            "Victim-blaming, trivialising of rape and the stigma faced by survivors are still far too common. The understanding of mutual consent; that only yes means yes, given freely without manipulation or coercion \u2013 is paramount in the prevention and eradication of rape and sexual harassment.",
            "Male involvement in ending SGBV is particularly crucial as many Kenyan communities remain highly patriarchal. As authority figures, men hold more power and influence over decision-making in the social domain and are often considered the custodians of culture. They are in a position to determine the cultural traits, behaviours and social practices that are viewed as either good or harmful.",
            "The socialisation of boys at an early age can have a long-term impact in shifting gender norms. Some harmful traditional notions of masculinity have been identified as the key drivers of aggression among the male gender.",
            "These include expectations of what it is \u201cto be a man,\u201d where boys are expected to be physically strong, aggressive, showing little emotion in order to maintain the tough persona. What boys learn about expectations of femininity and the value of women and girls at home and in the community also shapes their attitudes towards SGBV.",
            "Healthy masculinity",
            "Efforts should aim at engaging men on the dangers of toxic masculinity and internalised gender bias that can be harmful to the well-being of women and girls. By teaching boys about healthy masculinity, as well as the links between gender inequality and violence against women, we can begin to promote positive behaviours and attitudes towards women\u2019s rights, while eliminating harmful gender stereotypes.",

The State Department for Gender is coordinating efforts from a multi-sectoral approach to advocate for this cause. President Uhuru Kenyatta has made firm commitments towards the eradication of GBV and harmful practices by 2030 and to eradicate the practice of FGM by 2022. This strong commitment and leadership is a source of inspiration for all actors, including cultural and religious leaders and calls for concerted efforts to stop the violation of human rights.",

            "What causes earthquakes?",
            "On the earth\u2019s surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground, geologists say.",
            "The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, USGS explains, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel.",
            "The seismic activity of an area is basically the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period.",
            "The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is defined as the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume.",
            "How is the intensity measured?",
            "Earthquakes are measured by their magnitude, which is set up as a logarithmic scale ranging between zero and 10.",
            "Each whole number represents a tenfold increase in strength. The most powerful quake on record is a 9.5-magnitude one that struck Chile in May 1960.",
            "What is the difference between an earthquake and a tremor?",
            "While they are both signs of seismic movement within the earth, the difference is the intensity of the movement.",
            "Earthquakes, geologists say, are more intense than earth tremors. When a tremor exceeds five on the moment magnitude scale, it is referred to as an earthquake.",
            "The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling, researchers say.",
            "Is it possible to predict earthquakes?",
            "While some people may argue that the use of technology such as computing power, mathematical models, drones, satellite\u2014 including the use of artificial intelligence\u2014 as has been used in enhancing weather forecasting, may help predict occurrences of earthquake, geologists says it almost impossible to perfectly predict a quake because of the complexity of analysing the entirety of the planet\u2019s crust.",
            "\u201cAn earthquake happens very, very quickly. It\u2019s fair [to say] that at this point, we are not capable of predicting earthquakes at all,\u201d Christine Goulet, director of the USGS Earthquake Science Center, told The Washington Post.",
            "There is an element of randomness to how and when earthquakes happen. They sometimes happen without warning signs, experts say.",
            "At what depth do earthquakes occur? What is the significance of the depth?",
            "Earthquakes, according to USGS, occur in the crust or the upper mantle, which ranges from the Earth\u2019s surface to about 800 kilometers deep.",
            "Can humans cause earthquakes? Is there any way to prevent earthquakes?",
            "Earthquakes can be induced by a wide range of causes, including impoundment of reservoirs, surface and underground mining, withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface, and injection of fluids into underground formations.",
            "And yes, earthquakes can be induced by human activity\u2014 and these have been documented in many countries. Man-made earthquakes\u2019 effects, however small/little, are just as devastating as the natural one.",
            "The US Geological Survey report indicates that the hazard posed by man-made earthquakes can be mitigated by minimising or in some cases stopping the activity that is causing the earthquakes to occur.",
            "\u201cWe cannot prevent natural earthquakes from occurring but we can significantly mitigate their effects by identifying hazards, building safer structures, and providing education on earthquake safety. By preparing for natural earthquakes we can also reduce the risk from human induced earthquakes,\u201d the USGS notes.",
            "What should one do after an earthquake has happened?",
            "According to USGS, after the main quake, there are usually aftershocks that may occur hours, days or weeks later. These aftershocks may damage buildings and the resulting debris may injure people and animals.",
            "Due to the disastrous nature of earthquakes, they can damage gas lines. It is therefore advisable to avoid open flames in damaged buildings.",
            "At the scene, avoid using lighters and matches. If you happen to live near the coast, stay away from it since most of the time, the earthquakes cause flooding and even more disastrous tsunamis.",
            "And, when you have to drive, use alternative routes to get to the same destination, USGS advises. Damaged structures and traffic lights may make it difficult to get to the destination.",
            "How can you stay \u201csafer\u201d during an earthquake?",
            "Scientists advise individuals to stay calm, not to panic but to brace up and face whatever comes with courage as you look for safety.",
            "It is best to stay in an open space, away from trees, power lines, or bridges. If you\u2019re indoors, emergency rescuers advise: Drop to the ground and place your hands over your head and neck and crawl to safety under heavy furniture, say a table.",
            "Even so, avoid the kitchen area, shelves, windows since the shaking is likely to shatter window panes or move dangerous objects that could harm you as you look for safety.",

            "Incidentally, both had plans to confront each other on the same day. She arrived at the office, ready to speak her mind, only for him to come to her desk, grab her hand and pull her to an outdoor garden.",
            "\u201cI want to have sex with you. So when is that happening?\u201d he asked her.",
            "Esther says she was shocked by his outright demand.",
            "\u201cI told him I respect myself so much that I cannot sleep with him for just a night and walk away like nothing happened,\u201d she says.",
            "From then, he started avoiding her and could not assign her any roles. She spent sleepless nights wondering what her next move should be, having been cut off from gaining practical experience. She reached out to a female colleague.",
            "It is a small-scale company with less than 10 employees, she says.",
            "Her response was even more depressing: \u201cHe is known for that behaviour and there is nothing you can do. We don\u2019t have guidelines on who to report to when that happens. Just let it go.\u201d",
            "It was until she threatened to tell his wife of his unprofessional behaviour that he changed and resumed treating her professionally \u2013 sending her out for assignments and according her the necessary support in line of duty.",
            "Esther\u2019s experience is a definitive example of quid pro quo harassment, a form of sexual harassment in which employment decisions are made based on an employee\u2019s acceptance or rejection of unwelcome sexual behaviour. In this case, the head of department withdrawing his supervisory role on her because she declined his demand for sexual relations.",

            "It happens on social media, markets, supermarkets, gyms, hotels, salons, tea buying centres, churches, banking halls or on the road as one heads to the shop or the river. The list is long.",
            "In Kenya, sexual harassment is a criminal offence. Clause 23 of the Sexual Offences Act (2006) prohibits any person in authority or holding a public office from making sexual advances or requests. Such a person is liable to a minimum three-year jail term or penalty of not less than Sh100,000.",
            "The Act further criminalises other forms of sexual harassment such as sexual assault, attempted rape and indecent acts. These offences attract a five to a 10-year jail term.",
            "Busia Woman Representative Ms Florence Mutua had through her Sexual Offences (Amendment), 2016 sought to further specify forms of sexual harassment.",
            "She wanted \u201cany contact between any part of the body of a person with the genital organs, breasts or buttocks of another \u2026and exposure or display (of the same) or pornographic material to any person against his or her will,\u201d to be criminalised. The bill failed to get the legislators\u2019 approval.",
            "On the other hand, previously under the Employment Act (2007), only companies with more than 20 employees were bound by law to have a sexual harassment policy.",
            "But now, the Employment (Amendment) Act, 2019, demands of firms with more than five employees to have the policy. It should clearly state that each employee is entitled to employment that is free of sexual harassment, how to report the offences and redress measures thereof.",

            "For online, studies on digital security have shown prevalence of sexual harassment. A 2016 joint survey by Association of Media Women in Kenya (Amwik) and Article 19 Eastern Africa established that some 75 per cent of female journalists in Kenya have suffered online harassment, these included sexual harassment.",
            "Available evidence only shows cases of employees suing their managers or executives for sexual harassment but not an ordinary citizen against the other, an indication of either the public\u2019s ignorance or disillusionment.",

            "In 2017, a Kericho Employment and Labour Relations court awarded a female clinical officer Sh600,000 as general damages for sexual harassment. In case 53 of 2017, the officer had sued her manager for sexual advances. She declined, a decision she argued to have prompted him to end her employment at the health facility.",

            "Maria is an 84-year-old widow from Riruta Satellite, a low-income suburb in Nairobi. She is a mother of five children, two sons and three daughters. Her husband died three years ago, leaving her with the family property that included unoccupied land and some rentals.",
            "Shortly afterwards, she shared the property among her children as part of their inheritance and retained a portion as a source of income. Her youngest son was, however, unhappy with the division of property and maintains that his sisters have no rights to the property.",
            "He became hostile and violent towards his mother, intending to directly collect the rent from the rentals. He has now threatened to kill his mother and sisters to take over ownership of the property.",
            "Violence and ageism",
            "Unfortunately, Maria\u2019s story is just one of many. Violence against older women is widespread, with perpetrators ranging from intimate partners, family members, caregivers, and community members.",
            "As we draw to the end of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, an annual international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls, we must reflect on and galvanize action around the need to better protect older women like Maria from all forms of violence and ageism (the targeting of older persons on the basis of their age).",
            "Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization\u00a0estimated\u00a0that one in six older people- those above the age of 60 - globally, were subjected to abuse in 2019. This was spurred by factors including alcoholism and property ownership disputes, among other issues.",
            "Emerging evidence indicates that the abuse has sharply increased in many countries as a direct result of the pandemic.",
            "Covid-19",
            "Consider the containment measures instituted by governments to flatten the Covid-19 curve; the need for social distancing that culminated in the partial cessation of movement and in some instances, full lockdowns, have left, and continue to leave older persons alone, separated from caring kin who would otherwise often check in on them and ensure their wellbeing.",
            "This exposes them to rogue community members, relatives and caregivers who use the opportunity to exercise their control and abuse, particularly against older women.",
            "A\u00a0report by the\u00a0Social Science Research Council\u00a0indicates that Kenya is among the countries reporting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent average increase in sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) amid lockdowns. This harrowing statistic encompasses SGBV against older persons. What is worse is that victims rarely report the abuse for fear of victimisation. A vicious cycle is, therefore, established, fuelled by ageism and sustained by the inaction of the government and communities.",
            "HelpAge International Africa continues to work with communities to support them to recognize and prevent SGBV against older women and help them access safety and response services. This includes access to counselling and legal advice for survivors. We also provide older people with the information they need to seek support in case of abuse.",
            "Violence and abuse",
            "Additionally, we continue to advocate for laws and policies to protect older women from violence, abuse, and neglect. One such law is the\u00a0Protocol to the African Charter On Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa. This law provides for, among others,\u00a0the right to property inheritance by older women; their protection from all forms of violence and abuse, including those emanating from harmful traditional practices; and the provision of care and support. Four years since the adoption of the Protocol, Kenya is yet to ratify it, leaving the rights of older persons in the balance.",
            "Ending SGBV against older women will take a concerted effort. The government should ratify and implement the African Union Protocol on the Rights of Older Persons. Additionally, it must fully implement existing legislation that protects the rights of older women, including increasing budgetary allocation towards the protection and promotion of their rights.",
            "Communities must also treat older women with care and respect. Ageing is not an event but a process that starts at birth. It is, therefore, imperative that we collaborate in putting an end to the mistreatment of older persons including SGBV against them.",

            "A majority (82.2 per cent) missed school due to menstrual pain, found the study whose findings were published last year in the International Journal of Reproductive Medicine.",
            "Another 70.3 per cent were deterred by the fear of staining and being teased, while 63.4 per cent stayed away due to non-availability of pads.",
            "Another study Menstrual hygiene management in rural schools of Zambia; a descriptive study of knowledge, experiences and challenges faced by schoolgirls by Joyce Chinyama et al. attests to similar challenges.",
            "Girls in six rural schools in Zambia were interviewed.",
            "They said inadequate provision of sanitary materials, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools forced them to stay at home during menstruation.",

            "The findings are a reflection of Kenya\u2019s situation. It refers to a previous study in Kenya that established that \u201cPoor WASH facilities deter girls from using the facilities at school, with most girls opting to stay home until they finish menstruating.\u201d",
            "On average, girls begin puberty at 10 or 11 years depending on factors such as nutrition, guides Unesco in its 2014 document Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management.",
            "In Kenya, Unesco estimates that some 2.6 million girls in school need support to obtain menstrual hygiene products. Further, approximately 300,000 of girls in arid and semi-arid regions would require both sanitary towels and underwear at an estimated cost of Sh2.6 billion.",
            "In 2012/13 financial year, Sh300 million was set aside for the Ministry of Education to provide the sanitary towels. This amount was reduced to Sh30 million in 2013/14 financial year.",
            "Until 2017, the ministry provided an estimated 568,925 underprivileged girls in public primary schools in 82 districts (now sub-counties) within marginalised and slum areas.",
            "The coming into effect of Basic Education (Amendment) Act in June 2017 guaranteed all girls in puberty age enrolled in public primary and secondary schools, free provision of pads. In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was allocated Sh470 million. This catered for 14, 813, 810 packets distributed to 3.7 million girls during the fiscal year.\u00a0 A sum of Sh420, 618,057 was spent.",

            "Although data on girls in private schools is elusive, the current data could suggest that 72 per cent of the targeted girls have not benefited from the State sponsored programme.",
            "In May last year, the Ministry of Health launched Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030) with one of the five targets being commitment to ensure WASH facilities are provided in all households, learning institutions, public places, healthcare facilities, workplaces and correctional facilities.",
            "\u201cWithout (access to menstrual hygiene materials, latrines and places to change, safe water and sanitation, and good hygiene practices like hand washing with soap), the school environment is unhealthy, gender discriminatory and inadequate,\u201d states Unesco in its aforementioned publication.",

We had nothing for girls in vocational training and other institutions,\u201d Ms Kwekwe is quoted in a local newspaper article dated September 14, 2019.",
            "She added: \u201cWe have been having challenges because the money is not adequate. We need to have more so that girls can remain in school throughout but we have only been able to give them four months\u2019 supply in the past.\u201d",
            "With the new law accompanied with the Menstrual Hygiene Management Policy (2019-2030), it meant, the government sat at the centre of meeting the menstrual hygiene management needs of girls in public facilities.",
            "In 2017/18 financial year, the programme was moved to the Ministry of Public and Gender Affairs only for it to be moved back to the Education ministry, late 2019 following hiccups in tendering and distribution.",

            "\u201cI\u2019d go to places and fathers could come up to me and say \u2018Your book helped me figure out, how to break down this conversation at home with my sons and daughters,\u201d she says.",
            "Ms Mbugua is extending the book to add an addendum on the Pan-African perspective on emerging period poverty issues during the Covid-19 period. The new version will be out in two months.",
            "She says: \u201cPeriod poverty was blown wide open during Covid-19. Suddenly, schools that were giving pads were closed. Suddenly, the women who were washing clothes to earn a keep had lost their jobs. A lot of girls turned to sex for pads, more than we know.\u201d",
            "She is happy her relentless efforts on social media have resulted in more people engaging in the subject, wrapped as a taboo.",
            "\u201cI posted a picture of my stained pyjamas\u2026there were 10,000 likes and about 1,000 comments. It tells you people want to talk,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cA few people in the comment section are saying \u2018Thank you for just opening this door for us to comment on an issue that is so often a taboo.\u2019\u2026and for me that is a win.\u201d",
            "In the midst of the pandemic, Ms Mbugua has maintained the momentum through virtual activities.",
            "Last year, she held a virtual period party where women highlighted the prevailing challenges and advocated for action from the government. She has earned herself a special friend for her consistent campaign against period poverty; public criticism.",
            "Late last year, her foundation embarked on a sustainable approach of ending period poverty. It entered into partnership with The Pad Project to run a two-pronged pad project in Nairobi County.",
